{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package module that imports version information and an image constant, likely for version tracking or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own version and image constants from a relative module named 'version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing version and image constants from a local module; no data flow from external untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious imports, or suspicious behaviors are present. The license and copyright comments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two constants from a local module, likely for version control or configuration. There are no network operations, data processing, or untrusted inputs. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or complex constructs. It appears to be a standard, benign module import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for version and image constants, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign component of a larger package.",
