{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module-level metadata, importing version information and an image identifier from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version and image identifiers from a local module (.version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only imports data from internal modules without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version information and a constant IMAGE from a relative module. It is a typical module initialization pattern, with no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious constructs. The only notable aspect is the use of inline noqa comments for linter suppression, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to set up module metadata. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
