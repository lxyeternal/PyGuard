{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and an image constant from a local module, likely used for versioning and configuration in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.version' for __version__ and IMAGE.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior. The import statements are straightforward, and there are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard import statement that brings in version and image constants from a local module. It is a common pattern in Python projects to maintain versioning and configuration. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. No external data handling, insecure code practices, or obfuscated logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving a simple purpose of importing version and configuration constants. There is no indication of malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
