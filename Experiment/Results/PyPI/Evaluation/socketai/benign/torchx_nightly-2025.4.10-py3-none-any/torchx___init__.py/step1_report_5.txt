{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and a constant from a local module, likely for version tracking and configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.version' when importing __version__ and TORCHX_IMAGE.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears straightforward, importing version info and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports version and image constants from a local version module. It contains no logic, data handling, or external input/output operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. It adheres to standard practices for versioning and configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import versioning and configuration constants. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns evident.",
