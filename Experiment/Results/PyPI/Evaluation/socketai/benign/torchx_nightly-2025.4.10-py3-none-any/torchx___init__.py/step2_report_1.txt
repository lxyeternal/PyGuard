  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a simple Python module that imports two constants, `__version__` and `TORCHX_IMAGE`, from a local module `.version`. It includes standard licensing comments and uses `# pyre-strict` for type checking. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or external inputs.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No sinks that process external data.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The import statements are straightforward and standard.\n- No suspicious constructs or behaviors are present.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\nAll reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and serves a configuration or versioning purpose. They correctly identify the lack of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, as there is no security risk or vulnerability.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module import pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
