  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deployment utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is potential command injection if inputs are malicious and not validated. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (0.1-0.2) acknowledging the injection potential. Overall, the code is safe for typical use, but input validation could enhance security."
