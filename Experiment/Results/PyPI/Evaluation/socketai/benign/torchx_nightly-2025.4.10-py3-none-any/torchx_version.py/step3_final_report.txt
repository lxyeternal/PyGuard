{
  "purpose": "Defines a version string and constructs a Docker image reference, allowing environment/configuration override via load()",
  "sources": "The version string __version__, and the load() function which may read environment variables or configuration files",
  "sinks": "The final TORCHX_IMAGE variable, which could be influenced by external configuration but does not lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "load() retrieves configuration data that overrides the default image string; no data flows from untrusted sources into sensitive sinks beyond configuration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; use of load() is standard for configurable parameters",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining version info and constructing a container image string with optional environment override. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The load() function allows configuration overrides, which is common and safe if environment sources are trusted. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet for managing container image references with environment overrides. It poses no malicious or security threat. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
