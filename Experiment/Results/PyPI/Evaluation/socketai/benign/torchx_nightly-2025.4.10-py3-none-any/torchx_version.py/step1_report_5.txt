  "purpose": "Define version information and construct a Docker image tag for torchx, allowing environment overrides.",
  "sources": "Environment override via 'load' function from torchx.util.entrypoints, and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The load function potentially retrieves external configurations, but it is used in a controlled manner with a default function.",
  "flows": "The load function calls _get_torchx_image with __version__, potentially overridden by environment, to produce a Docker image tag.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. Use of versioning and environment override appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, constructs a Docker image tag based on this version, and allows for environment-based override via a standard entrypoint loader. No external data or untrusted input sources are evident. The load function uses a default function which is safe. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, implementing version management and environment overrides in a controlled, standard way. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
