{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and variables related to versioning and container image configuration for a Python package, with no apparent direct functionality beyond setup and configuration.",
  "sources": "The environment or external configuration can override the default image through the 'load' function, which may fetch environment variables or configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The only data output is the image string, which is constructed from internal variables; no untrusted data is sent externally.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a container image URL based on internal version info, with optional override via configuration. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The use of load with default functions is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a utility for loading configuration, defines a version string following semantic versioning, and constructs a container image reference. The load function potentially fetches environment or configuration data, but this is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup tasks related to versioning and container image specification without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
