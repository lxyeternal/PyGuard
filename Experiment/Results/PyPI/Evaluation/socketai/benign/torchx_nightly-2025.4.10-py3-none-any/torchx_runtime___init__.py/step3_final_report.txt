  "purpose": "This code serves as a module-level documentation and licensing header for the torchx.runtime package, providing descriptions and categorization of sub-modules.",
  "sources": "Comments, licensing notices, and docstrings within the code",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external data handling, or untrusted data sources present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only static documentation and comments",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data processing, or suspicious constructs; purely descriptive",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of licensing comments, module descriptions, and docstrings with no executable statements or data flows. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The documentation is standard and does not interact with external inputs or outputs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of documentation and licensing comments. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
