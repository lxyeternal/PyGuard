{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation, example functions, and templates for defining TorchX components, primarily serving as educational or illustrative material.",
  "sources": "Comments, docstrings, and example functions within the module; no runtime data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks, external calls, or data leaks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and consists of definitions and comments only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of comments, documentation, and example functions that return structured specifications without executing any logic or external interactions. No malicious or security-sensitive operations are embedded. The code's static nature and purpose as documentation mean it poses negligible security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely educational/documentational with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It contains no executable logic, data leaks, or network activity. The scores are consistent with its benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1). No further action is necessary.",
