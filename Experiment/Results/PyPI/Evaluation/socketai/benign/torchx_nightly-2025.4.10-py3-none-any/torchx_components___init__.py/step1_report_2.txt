  "purpose": "Documentation and explanation of how to create, validate, and run TorchX components and apps.",
  "sources": "Comments, docstrings, and code snippets describing functions and their arguments.",
  "sinks": "No execution of untrusted input, no network communication, no data leakage points, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; primarily static documentation and function templates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is purely informational with no executable logic that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of descriptive comments, docstrings, and sample function templates for TorchX components. It provides guidelines for defining, validating, and running components but contains no executable code that interacts with external data, performs I/O, network communication, or sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The entire code appears to be benign documentation and example templates intended for user guidance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation and template examples for creating TorchX components. It does not contain any executable, malicious, or suspicious code. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
