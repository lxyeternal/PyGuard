  "purpose": "Documentation and example code for TorchX components, explaining how to define, validate, and run components programmatically and via CLI.",
  "sources": "Comments, docstrings, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code behavior detected; the code is purely documentation and example functions.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is mainly composed of comments, docstrings, and an example function template for defining TorchX components. It describes how to create components, validate them, and run them via CLI or programmatically. There are no user inputs, data processing, network communication, or any other operations that could be exploited or malicious. The example function 'ddp' is a simple template returning a specs.AppDef object, with no execution logic or external calls. Overall, the code serves an educational purpose without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation and example templates for TorchX components with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious operations or embedded malicious code. Overall security risk is very low.",
