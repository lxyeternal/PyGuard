  "purpose": "Documentation and explanation of TorchX components, their usage, authoring, validation, and running procedures.",
  "sources": "Commented license and copyright headers, docstrings, and descriptive comments within the code.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code consists mainly of comments, docstrings, and explanatory text. No untrusted data input or output points are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely informational/documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code contains no executable logic beyond comments and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is predominantly composed of comments, licensing information, and descriptive documentation about TorchX components and usage instructions. There are no function definitions, input/output handling, or executable code that could be exploited. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The absence of actual executable code limits the possibility of hidden malicious intent or obfuscation. The code appears to serve as documentation or a guide for using TorchX components.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely informational and documentation for TorchX components. It contains no executable logic, data input/output, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk score is negligible.",
