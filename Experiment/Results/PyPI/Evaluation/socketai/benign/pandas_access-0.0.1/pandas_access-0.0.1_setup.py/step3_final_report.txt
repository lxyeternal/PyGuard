  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_access Python package, defining package metadata and reading the README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data sinks; no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' during setup; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; use of outdated 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools' noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that imports 'os' and 'distutils.core.setup', reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with package metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'distutils' is outdated but not malicious. The code's behavior is benign and typical for package distribution. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
