{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_access Python package, intended to facilitate package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file using open() and __file__ to determine the path.",
  "sinks": "The open() function reading the README.md file; no untrusted data processing or output sinks detected.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README.md file to include its content as the long_description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present. Usage of setup() from distutils is standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script. It imports necessary modules, defines a file path for README.md, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no data manipulation from untrusted sources are present. The file reading is static and conventional. All components are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to package the 'pandas_access' module and includes the README file for documentation purposes.",
