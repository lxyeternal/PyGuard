{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_access Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to include as long description; reads input from environment during setup execution if any (though not explicitly used here).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling evident; no external network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content during package setup; no flow of untrusted data into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior; standard setup script with straightforward package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines the path to README.md, and calls setup() with package metadata. It reads the README file content to include as long_description. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external network operations. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs package configuration without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
