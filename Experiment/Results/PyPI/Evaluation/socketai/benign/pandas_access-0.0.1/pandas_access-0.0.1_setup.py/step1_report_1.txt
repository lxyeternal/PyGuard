{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_access Python package, used to define package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the filesystem to include as long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network or system calls that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading local file README.md during setup, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools.setup' is outdated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations, defining package name, version, author info, description, and including the README file. No input from untrusted sources, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution or network activity. The only potential concern is reading the README file; however, this is standard practice and not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It follows standard practices and does not contain any security risks or malware indicators.",
