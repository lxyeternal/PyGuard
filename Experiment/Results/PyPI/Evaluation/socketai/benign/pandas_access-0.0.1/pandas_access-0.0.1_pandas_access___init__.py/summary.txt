  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for MS Access data extraction with no malicious payloads. The main security issue is the lack of input validation for filenames and table names passed to subprocess, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is present. To mitigate risks, input validation or sanitization should be implemented before passing parameters to subprocess calls. The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the identified vulnerabilities."
