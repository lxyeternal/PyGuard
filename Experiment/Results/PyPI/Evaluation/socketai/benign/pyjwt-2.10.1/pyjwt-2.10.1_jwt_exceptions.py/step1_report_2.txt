  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JWT (JSON Web Token) handling and related cryptographic errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, inheritance, and string representation methods",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling occurs in this code",
  "flows": "None; code purely defines exception classes without data flow or logic execution",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "This code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes for JWT errors, including token validation issues and cryptographic errors. It includes a class with a custom __str__ method for informative error messages. All classes are straightforward, inheriting from base Exception classes, with no external data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for JWT handling without any malicious intent or security risks.",
