  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:**\n\n- All reports state that the code only defines custom exception classes for JWT and JWK errors.\n- The code indeed consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception or custom subclasses, with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports accurately describe the code as benign exception class definitions with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flow, external dependencies, or malicious activity.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue and suggest any changes if unreasonable:**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring appears reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified since the code is purely exception class definitions with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Conclusion:** No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**5. Pay close attention to the malware score:**\n\n- All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they simply describe the code as standard exception classes.\n- No assumptions of hidden malicious intent are made; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** No challenges needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**7. Ensure the scores are consistent with the report:**\n\n- All scores are consistent and justified based on the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.**",
