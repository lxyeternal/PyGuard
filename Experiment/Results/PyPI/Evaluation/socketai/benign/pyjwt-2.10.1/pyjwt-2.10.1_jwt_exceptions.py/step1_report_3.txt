  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JWT handling errors.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; solely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output actions present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to JWT errors. All classes inherit from Exception or other custom classes, serving as structured error types for JWT token validation and handling. There are no functions performing data processing, no input reading, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard implementation of exception class definitions, with a minor customization in the MissingRequiredClaimError class, which allows for a specific claim name to be included in the error message.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions used for handling JWT-related errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign, standard component for JWT error management.",
