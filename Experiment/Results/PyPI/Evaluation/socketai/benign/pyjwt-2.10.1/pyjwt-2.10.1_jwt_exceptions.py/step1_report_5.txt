  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling JWT-related errors in a security or authentication library.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, no external data input or reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; this is purely class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions related to JWT processing. All classes inherit from standard Exception classes and do not perform any operations, data handling, or external communications. There are no input/output sources, no data flows, and no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The structure is straightforward and standard for defining exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exceptions for JWT error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and poses no security risk.",
