  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to JWT and JWK errors.\n   - No data input/output, external processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - Exception classes inherit straightforwardly from base exception classes, with one class (`MissingRequiredClaimError`) having a custom `__str__` method for informative error messages.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Evaluation:**\n   - The exception hierarchy appears standard and appropriate for a JWT handling library.\n   - The classes are purely declarative, serving as error markers.\n   - The inclusion of specific error classes (e.g., `InvalidSignatureError`, `ExpiredSignatureError`, `InvalidAudienceError`, etc.) aligns with typical JWT validation scenarios.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly state that the code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of data flow, external dependencies, or malicious code.\n   - The reports assign a confidence level of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores all at 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly set to 0; code is straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Correctly set to 0; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code is only a part of a larger library; by itself, it does not introduce risks.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here, as the code does not perform any operations beyond class definitions.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for JWT error handling. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present.",
