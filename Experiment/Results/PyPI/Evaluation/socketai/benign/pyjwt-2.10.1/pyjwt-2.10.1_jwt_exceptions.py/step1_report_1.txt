{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and JSON Web Keys (JWK) in a security library.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; exception classes are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only declares exception classes without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for JWT and JWK errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. All classes inherit from standard exception classes, and no dynamic or external operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be part of a larger, security-focused library for token handling, and its structure is typical for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class declarations for JWT and JWK errors with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
