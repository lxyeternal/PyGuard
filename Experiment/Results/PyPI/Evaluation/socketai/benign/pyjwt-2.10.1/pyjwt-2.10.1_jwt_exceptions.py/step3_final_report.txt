  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JWT and JWK error handling to facilitate specific error identification and management within a JWT processing library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inherit from base exception classes; no data input/output or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; exception classes serve as error markers only.",
  "flows": "Exception hierarchy flows from specific error classes to general exception classes; no data flow or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class hierarchy with minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various JWT and JWK error types, with one class customizing its string representation. There are no data flows, external dependencies, or malicious behaviors. The exception hierarchy is standard and benign. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and full confidence. The code does not perform any operations beyond class declarations, and no vulnerabilities or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for JWT error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
