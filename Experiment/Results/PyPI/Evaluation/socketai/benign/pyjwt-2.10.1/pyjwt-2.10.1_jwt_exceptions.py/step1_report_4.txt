  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JWT processing errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class and exception definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output; purely exception class definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow; no source-to-sink pathways present",
  "anomalies": "None observed; all classes are standard exception subclasses with no suspicious logic or code execution",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for JWT-related errors, including various specific token validation errors. There are no input reads, data processing, or potential data leaks. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or external dependencies are involved. The classes are straightforward and serve as error markers without any malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely defines exception classes for JWT error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
