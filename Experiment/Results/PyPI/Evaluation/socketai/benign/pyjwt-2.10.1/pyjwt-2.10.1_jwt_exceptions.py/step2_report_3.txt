  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to JWT and JWK errors.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic.\n   - No network communication, cryptographic operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The only notable method is `__str__` in `MissingRequiredClaimError`, which formats an error message based on a claim name.\n   - All classes inherit from standard exception classes, establishing a hierarchy for error handling.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, external calls, or cryptographic operations.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n   - The exception hierarchy appears standard and benign.\n\n3. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that this code is purely for error handling in a JWT context.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are detected.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0. The code is a set of exception classes with no security implications.\n   \n   These scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes:**\n   - No changes are necessary; the reports accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n   - The only minor note is that the `MissingRequiredClaimError` class has a custom `__str__` method, which is standard practice for informative error messages.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a typical exception hierarchy for a security library handling JWTs.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation present.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores align with the analysis. The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
