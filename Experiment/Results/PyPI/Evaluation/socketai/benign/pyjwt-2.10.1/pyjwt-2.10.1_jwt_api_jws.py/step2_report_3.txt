  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard JWT handling, no suspicious inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network activity, data flows are typical for JWT processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard cryptographic practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or sabotage detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — consistent.\n- Risk: 0.2 — low, considering typical JWT library risks (misuse of keys, algorithm misconfiguration).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is reasonable. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on encoding/decoding, header validation, and cryptographic operations.\n- No suspicious behavior, no external network activity.\n- Uses standard practices, with warnings about deprecated kwargs.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard and low-risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on JWT signing, verification, header handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- Uses standard cryptographic practices.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis, emphasizing safe cryptographic operations and data handling.\n- No malicious indicators, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's scores and conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Describes standard JWT handling, cryptographic operations, validation.\n- No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Proper validation and error handling.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns or techniques.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0, justified by the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign a low risk (0.2), which seems appropriate given the typical risks associated with JWT libraries (misuse, configuration errors), but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured JWT handling library with no malicious or sabotage signals.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — typical for cryptographic libraries, mainly due to potential misuse rather than malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard JWT handling implementation with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
