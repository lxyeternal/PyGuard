{
  "purpose": "The code implements a JSON Web Token (JWT) handling library, providing encoding, decoding, signature verification, and algorithm management functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from JWT strings, headers, payloads, and cryptographic keys; accesses algorithm objects for signing and verification.",
  "sinks": "Processes include cryptographic signing, signature verification, and JSON/base64url encoding/decoding; no external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "JWT strings are parsed into header, payload, and signature segments; headers and payloads are decoded; cryptographic algorithms sign or verify data; results are returned or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. The code uses dynamic algorithm registration, which is standard but could be misused if untrusted algorithms are registered; however, this is a common extensibility pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT operations with proper validation, error handling, and cryptographic practices. It relies on external Algorithm objects assumed to be secure. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic registration of algorithms is flexible but not inherently malicious. The data flow is straightforward, with no external network activity or data leaks. The code's structure and comments indicate a well-maintained, legitimate library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured JWT library with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The risk score (0.2) reflects typical JWT handling risks like key management or algorithm configuration, not malicious activity.",
