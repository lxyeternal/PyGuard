  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard JWT handling, no suspicious inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** JWTs are parsed, verified, and returned. No external network or data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard maintenance signals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical JWT library with no malicious intent, relying on cryptographic algorithms. The report assigns malware score 0, security risk 0.2, and obfuscated 0, which seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the analysis. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar JWT encoding/decoding, with focus on cryptographic operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows through cryptographic signing and verification, with no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or backdoors; use of warnings for deprecated features is normal.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard JWT operations, with no malicious behavior detected. Malware score 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** JWT signing/verification, header validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar cryptographic and data handling flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious intent, malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** JWT decoding/verification, key handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signature verification, payload extraction.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or backdoors, standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** JWT creation, encoding, decoding, verification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cryptographic functions, JSON, base64url, no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard cryptographic handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate JWT handling, no malicious intent, malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across all reports reflect typical JWT handling risks like misconfiguration or key management issues, not malicious activity.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, standard, and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — consistent with inherent JWT handling risks, not malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are reasonable and justified based on the code review. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured JWT library with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent. The security posture is appropriate for a cryptographic library, assuming proper key management and algorithm choices by the user.",
