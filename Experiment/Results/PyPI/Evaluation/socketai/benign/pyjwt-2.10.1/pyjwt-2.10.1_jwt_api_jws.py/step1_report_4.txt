{
  "purpose": "Implementation of JSON Web Signature (JWS) handling, including encoding, decoding, and signature verification for JWT tokens.",
  "sources": "Inputs include JWT strings, keys (strings, bytes, or PyJWK objects), headers, and options. Data is read from JWT tokens during decoding, headers, and keys provided to methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows include signature verification and key usage, but no unsafe data sinks like network connections or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Source data (JWT, keys, headers) flows through decoding and verification methods, leading to cryptographic signature verification. Payload extraction follows validation of signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard JWT operations with proper validation steps. No obfuscated or misleading code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT handling, including encoding, decoding, signature verification, and header parsing. It uses safe practices for base64 decoding, JSON parsing, and cryptographic verification, relying on Algorithm objects. No suspicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or malicious payload manipulation is observed. The use of warnings for deprecated parameters is benign. No hardcoded secrets, external command executions, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of JWT handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly manages cryptographic operations and data parsing, following expected security practices.",
