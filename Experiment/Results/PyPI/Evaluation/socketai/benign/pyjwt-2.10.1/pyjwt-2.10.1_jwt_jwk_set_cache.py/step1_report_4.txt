{
  "purpose": "The code manages caching of a JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) with expiration logic.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters (e.g., jwk_set in put method), and internal timestamp via get_timestamp().",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; primarily manages cache state.",
  "flows": "Input jwk_set -> put() updates cache; get() retrieves cached data if valid; is_expired() checks timestamp for expiration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard time monotonic for expiration checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cache for JWK Sets, with expiration managed via monotonic clock. It updates cache entries with an optional set, clears cache if None, and retrieves cached data if not expired. The is_expired() method compares current time to stored timestamp plus lifespan. No external inputs or outputs are misused, no data leakage or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be straightforward cache logic without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard cache implementation for JWK Sets, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages cached data with expiration logic.",
