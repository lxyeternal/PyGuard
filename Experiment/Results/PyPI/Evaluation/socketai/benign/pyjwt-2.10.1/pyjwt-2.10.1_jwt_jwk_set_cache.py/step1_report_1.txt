  "purpose": "Manage caching of JSON Web Key Sets (JWK) with expiration logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the put() method (JWK sets), and the get() method (cache retrieval). It also reads system time via time.monotonic().",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files, and no external calls are made.",
  "flows": "JWK set is stored via put() (source), and retrieved via get(). The expiration check compares system time with stored timestamp (sink), but does not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code appears to perform standard cache management without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple cache for JWK sets with expiration based on system time. It correctly handles cache invalidation when data is expired or cleared. No dynamic code execution, external data leaks, or malicious logic is present. The use of time.monotonic() is appropriate for measuring elapsed time. Overall, the logic is straightforward and free of malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard caching implementation for JWK sets, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Security risk is minimal.",
