  "purpose": "Manage caching of JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) with timestamp and expiration logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'jwk_set' in the 'put' method, and system time via 'time.monotonic()' in 'is_expired'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data leaks or sensitive data processing outside cache management.",
  "flows": "Input 'jwk_set' -> stored in cache -> retrieved via 'get' -> expiration checked with system time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual control flow; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward caching mechanism for JWK sets with expiration based on monotonic time. It uses standard Python practices and does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code appears to be part of a JWT validation system, which is common in security-sensitive applications, but the snippet itself contains no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a cache handler for JWK sets with expiration control. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior. It is a standard implementation for managing cached cryptographic keys.",
