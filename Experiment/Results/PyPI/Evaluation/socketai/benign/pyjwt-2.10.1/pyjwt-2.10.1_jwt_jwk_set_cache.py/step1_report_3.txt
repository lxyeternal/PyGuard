{
  "purpose": "This code manages a cache for JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) with expiration handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as 'jwk_set' in 'put()' and system time via 'time.monotonic()' in 'is_expired()'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs cached JWKS in 'get()' and internally handles expiration logic; no data leaks or untrusted sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'put()' into the cache, then 'get()' retrieves it, with expiration checks via 'is_expired()' based on system time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. Usage of 'time.monotonic()' is appropriate for expiration checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cache class for JWKS with expiration logic. It updates cache with 'put()', retrieves with 'get()', and checks expiration with 'is_expired()'. It relies on 'time.monotonic()' for reliable timing. No external inputs, untrusted data, or security-sensitive operations like network calls or file access are present. The implementation appears standard and safe, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward cache management module for JWKS, with no malicious behavior detected. It securely manages in-memory data with proper expiration checks. There are no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
