  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.release(), platform.python_implementation(), sys.pypy_version_info, imports of json, platform, sys, and cryptography.",
  "sinks": "Print statement in main() outputs JSON data, which could potentially be exploited if this script is compromised or if the output is captured maliciously.",
  "flows": "Information is collected from system and environment modules and outputted via print as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details, Python implementation info, and cryptography library version if available. It handles potential exceptions, such as missing modules or OS errors, gracefully. The code is designed for reporting purposes and does not include any data leaks, external network communications, or malicious payloads. No anomalies, suspicious flows, or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for collecting environment information for bug reports. No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
