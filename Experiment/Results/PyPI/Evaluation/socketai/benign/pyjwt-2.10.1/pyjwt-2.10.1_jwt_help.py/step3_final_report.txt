  "purpose": "Collect environment and version information including OS, Python implementation, cryptography, and pyjwt versions for bug reporting.",
  "sources": "platform, sys modules, imported __version__, cryptography module if available",
  "sinks": "print() function outputs JSON data to stdout",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system modules and version variables, then formatted into a JSON object and printed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local version variable, handles exceptions gracefully, and outputs system info as JSON. It performs no network activity, file I/O, or untrusted input handling. The logic is straightforward and aligns with benign environment reporting. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for collecting environment info with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
