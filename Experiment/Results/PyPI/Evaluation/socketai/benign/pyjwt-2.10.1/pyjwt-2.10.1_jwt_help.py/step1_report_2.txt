  "purpose": "The code generates system and environment information for bug reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system information from platform and sys modules, and imports version info from the current package and cryptography module.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON string via print function.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from platform, sys, and module attributes, then assembled into a dictionary, which is serialized and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code's purpose appears to be benign and standard for environment reporting.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info, Python implementation details, and version info for dependencies. It handles exceptions gracefully and formats data into JSON for reporting. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file access, or data exfiltration. Usage of __version__ attributes and platform info is standard. The code does not perform any risky operations or contain hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to gather system and package information for bug reports. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
