{
  "purpose": "The code generates system and environment information for bug reports, including platform details, Python implementation, and versions of specific libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads data from platform module (system, release), sys module (pypy_version_info), and imported libraries (__version__, cryptography, pyjwt).",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON-formatted system info via print(). No data is sent over the network or written to files. No untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system modules and library versions, then assembled into a dictionary and printed as JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers environment details including OS, Python implementation and version, and versions of cryptography and pyjwt libraries. It handles potential exceptions gracefully. No untrusted inputs, external network interactions, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The logic is simple and standard for debugging or reporting purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for collecting system and library version information for bug reports. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks.",
