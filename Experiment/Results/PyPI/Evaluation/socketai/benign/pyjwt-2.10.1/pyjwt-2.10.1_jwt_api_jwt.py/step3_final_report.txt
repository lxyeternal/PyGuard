{
  "purpose": "This code implements a JSON Web Token (JWT) handling library, providing functions for encoding, decoding, and validating JWTs with claim checks and cryptographic signature verification.",
  "sources": "Input payloads, JWT strings, cryptographic keys, claim data, environment variables (if used externally), JSON payloads.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic signing/verifying functions, JSON serialization/deserialization, claim validation logic, warnings for deprecated parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data (payloads, keys) flows into encoding/decoding functions; claims are validated and claims data flows through validation functions; cryptographic functions verify signatures; payloads are serialized/deserialized during encode/decode processes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, no backdoors, no unusual data flows or code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT operations: encoding payloads with optional datetime claim conversions, decoding with payload validation, and claim validation functions for 'iat', 'nbf', 'exp', 'aud', 'iss', 'sub', 'jti'. It uses external cryptographic functions from 'api_jws' and handles errors appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling are present. The use of warnings for deprecated features indicates maintenance but not malicious intent. The overall structure is clear, with proper validation and error handling, consistent with a secure JWT library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of JWT handling with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It performs expected cryptographic and claim validation functions reliably. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the code aligns with best practices for such libraries.",
