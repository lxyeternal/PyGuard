  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard JWT library with encoding, decoding, validation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input/output are typical for JWT processing; no suspicious data flow.\n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Correct use of cryptography, claim validation, proper error handling.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior; code appears secure and standard.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar purpose and analysis.\n- No suspicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- Proper claim validation.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same overall conclusion.\n- No malicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.2\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings.\n- No suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with others; standard JWT handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Malware:** All reports agree the code is free of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, consistent with the code being a standard JWT library.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a well-implemented, standard JWT library.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The claim of potential vulnerabilities is unfounded; claims are based on standard JWT practices, not assumptions.\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for cryptographic libraries with proper validation)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, secure JWT handling library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
