{
  "purpose": "The code provides a library for encoding and decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with validation of claims and support for various algorithms.",
  "sources": "User input: jwt tokens for decoding, payload data for encoding, and optional parameters such as keys, algorithms, and options.",
  "sinks": "Decoded payloads, JWT strings, and potentially sensitive data within the payloads or headers. The encode function outputs JWT strings; decode functions process and validate incoming tokens.",
  "flows": "User provides JWT strings → decode_complete or decode processes the JWT → validation functions check claims → payload is returned or errors raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code primarily performs validation, encoding, and decoding. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard JWT implementation, focusing on secure encoding, decoding, and claim validation. It correctly handles potential claims such as 'exp', 'nbf', 'iat', 'aud', etc., with proper error handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. The only notable aspect is the use of warnings for deprecated parameters, which is standard for library maintenance. The functions and methods appear to be purely for token handling without external side effects or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured JWT handling library without malicious intent. It performs validation of tokens and claims without executing untrusted code or exfiltrating data. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
