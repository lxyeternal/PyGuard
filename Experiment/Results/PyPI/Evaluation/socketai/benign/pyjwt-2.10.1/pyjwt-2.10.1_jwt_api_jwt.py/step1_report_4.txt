  "purpose": "A Python library for encoding, decoding, and validating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).",
  "sources": "User-provided JWT strings, payloads, and cryptographic keys.",
  "sinks": "Decoded JWT payloads, cryptographic keys, and JWT strings. Potential for signature verification or payload manipulation.",
  "flows": "JWT strings are input into decode/decodes functions, which verify signatures and parse payloads, leading to payload validation and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of warnings and deprecated arguments suggests transition management, not malicious intent. No network calls, file operations, or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT encoding and decoding functions with payload validation, including claim checks and signature verification. It relies on external modules for cryptography and JSON processing, with careful handling of input types and potential errors. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors, is evident. The code appears to follow secure practices for token handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payload insertion. Use of warnings and deprecation notices indicates ongoing updates or version transitions, not malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical JWT utility library with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected cryptographic and validation functions securely. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. It appears safe for use in security-sensitive contexts.",
