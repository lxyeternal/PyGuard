  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for encoding, decoding, signature transformations, and format detection.",
  "sources": "Input data for base64url decoding, signature bytes, PEM and SSH key format checks.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data processed in decoding and format detection functions; no direct data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through decoding and format detection functions, with validation and transformation steps; no external or network flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; code is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cryptographic data handling functions, including base64url encoding/decoding, signature format conversions, PEM format detection, and SSH key format recognition. It relies on well-established libraries with safe fallbacks, handles untrusted input cautiously, and employs standard regex for format detection. No malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The functions are correctly implemented, with appropriate error handling and validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic utility module with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
