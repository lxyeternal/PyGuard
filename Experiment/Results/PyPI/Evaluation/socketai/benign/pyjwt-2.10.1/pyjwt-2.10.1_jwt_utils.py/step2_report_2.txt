  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of cryptographic utility functions: encoding/decoding base64url, signature format conversions, PEM/SSH key format detection.\n- No network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.\n- The functions rely on standard cryptography libraries, with optional imports.\n- The regex for PEM detection and the key format checks are standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources/sinks/flows:** Accurately describes standard cryptographic utility functions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 (low, as expected for utility code)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- Correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Scores are the same.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Same observations as above.\n- The analysis confirms benign utility functions.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Same conclusions.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns.\n- The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Also consistent with previous assessments.\n- Recognizes the code as standard cryptographic utilities.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard utility functions for cryptography.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** Should be **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** Should be **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** Given that these are utility functions with no malicious intent, a low risk score like **0.1 or 0.2** is appropriate. The current score of 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely utility functions with no side effects, network activity, or secret handling, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set security risk to around 0.1 for completeness, acknowledging that utility code inherently carries minimal risk but is not malicious.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n**Malware: 0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0**  \n**Risk: 0.1**",
