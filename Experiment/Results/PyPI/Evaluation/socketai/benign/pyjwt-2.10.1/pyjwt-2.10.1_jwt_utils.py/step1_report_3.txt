  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, decoding, and handling cryptographic data, including PEM format detection, base64url operations, and signature conversions.",
  "sources": "Imports cryptography library, handles input data conversions and encoding/decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that send data externally or perform network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings/bytes) is processed through encoding/decoding functions and signature conversions, with no external data transmission or critical side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to implement standard cryptographic encoding/decoding routines without suspicious or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for cryptographic operations, such as base64url encoding/decoding, integer-byte conversions, and signature format conversions. It includes PEM format detection using regex and checks for SSH key formats. All functions perform standard cryptographic data handling; no suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. The only external dependency is the cryptography library, which is optional and used for decoding/encoding signatures, typical for cryptographic implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for cryptographic data handling with no signs of malicious intent. It follows standard practices and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs. No malware or security risks identified.",
