  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of cryptographic utility functions: encoding/decoding base64url, signature format conversions, PEM/SSH key format detection, and data type conversions.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present.\n- The functions handle untrusted input cautiously, with proper validation and error handling.\n- The use of optional cryptography library imports with safe fallbacks indicates good practice.\n- Regular expressions for PEM detection and string matching for SSH keys are standard approaches.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The report does not identify any issues present in the code. All functions perform standard cryptographic data handling with appropriate validation.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2), consistent with utility functions that could be misused if fed malicious data but are not inherently dangerous.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), justified by the straightforward, standard implementation.\n\n### Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n- The code is purely utility functions with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- The code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.2  \n- Slightly elevated due to potential misuse of cryptographic functions with untrusted data, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility module.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain compromise.\n- The thorough regex for PEM detection and key format recognition are standard practices, not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                       | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                       | Clear, well-structured code.                                 |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2                     | Slight potential for misuse with untrusted data, but benign.|\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code is safe and standard for cryptographic utilities.",
