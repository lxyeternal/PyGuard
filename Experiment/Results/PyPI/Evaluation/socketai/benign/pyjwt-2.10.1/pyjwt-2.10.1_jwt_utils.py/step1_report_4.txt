{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling cryptographic data encoding/decoding, signature transformations, and PEM/SSH key format recognition.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters, such as strings, bytes, and cryptographic signatures.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that decode or encode data (base64, DER signatures), which could be misused if untrusted input is fed into them, but these are standard cryptographic operations. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (possibly untrusted) through encoding/decoding functions, signature conversions, and format checks. No evident malicious data flow path leads outside the standard cryptographic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs standard cryptographic utilities, including signature and format handling. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cryptographic utilities such as base64url encoding/decoding, signature conversion between DER and raw formats, and format recognition for PEM and SSH keys. All functions perform well-defined, conventional operations. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations are evident. The functions do not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The use of cryptography libraries appears legitimate and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of cryptographic utility functions intended for safe data handling and format recognition. It appears to be a benign, standard cryptography-related module with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
