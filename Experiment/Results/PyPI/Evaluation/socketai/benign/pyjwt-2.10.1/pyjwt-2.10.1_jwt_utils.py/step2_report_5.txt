  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of cryptographic utility functions: encoding/decoding base64url, signature format conversions, PEM/SSH key format detection, and data transformations.\n- The functions rely on standard cryptography libraries (cryptography package), with optional imports.\n- No network, file I/O, or external communication is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The regex for PEM detection and the format checks for SSH keys are standard practices.\n- The overall structure and logic appear sound and typical for cryptographic utility modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears correct and free of malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident based on the provided functions.\n- The functions handle untrusted data inputs cautiously, with appropriate error handling.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- While the code handles cryptographic data, improper use (feeding untrusted data into signature verification or decoding functions) could lead to vulnerabilities, but this is standard for such utilities and not a code issue per se.\n- The regex for PEM detection is standard; no issues there.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable; utility functions, but improper use could lead to vulnerabilities if integrated insecurely elsewhere.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard cryptographic utility library with no malicious intent.\n- The functions are well-implemented, with no evident security flaws.\n- The low security risk score is justified, but the utility nature means potential misuse if integrated improperly.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to provide an overall final recommendation or any further analysis?**",
