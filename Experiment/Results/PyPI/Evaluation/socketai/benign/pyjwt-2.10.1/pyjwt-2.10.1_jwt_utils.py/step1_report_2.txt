{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for encoding, decoding, and transforming cryptographic data, especially related to base64url encoding, ASN.1 DER signatures, and PEM/SSH key format recognition.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters receiving strings, bytes, integers, and cryptographic signature data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cryptography library functions (decode_dss_signature, encode_dss_signature) and data returned after encoding/decoding operations, which could be misused if fed malicious data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding functions, conversions, and format checks, with no evident external network or system calls. Signature transformations may process untrusted cryptographic data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard cryptographic data handling and format validation. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The regular expression and data handling appear standard for cryptographic utilities.",
  "analysis": "The script implements common cryptography utilities, including base64url encoding/decoding, integer-to-bytes conversions, and DER/RAW signature conversions, relying on established cryptography functions. The code checks for PEM and SSH key formats using regex and string matching. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network activity. The code appears well-structured and standard, focused on cryptographic data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptography utility module with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It primarily handles encoding, decoding, and format recognition for cryptographic keys and signatures. No malicious or sabotage patterns are detected.",
