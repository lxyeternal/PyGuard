  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, decoding, and processing cryptographic signatures, base64, and PEM/SSH key formats.",
  "sources": "Functions that read input data include 'force_bytes', 'base64url_decode', 'from_base64url_uint', 'bytes_from_int', 'bytes_to_number', and 'is_pem_format'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are in 'base64url_decode', 'base64url_encode', 'to_base64url_uint', 'from_base64url_uint', 'number_to_bytes', 'bytes_to_number', 'der_to_raw_signature', and 'raw_to_der_signature' which process or output data, including cryptographic signatures and encoded data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input functions ('force_bytes', 'base64url_decode') to cryptographic processing functions ('decode_dss_signature', 'encode_dss_signature', 'number_to_bytes'), with outputs being encoded or decoded cryptographic signatures or format verifications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard cryptographic utility functions with proper handling of cryptography data formats. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of regex for PEM detection, which is a standard approach.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for cryptographic operations such as encoding/decoding base64url, converting integers to bytes and vice versa, and handling DER/RAW signature formats. It includes mechanisms for PEM format detection and SSH key format recognition. All functions are typical for cryptographic key handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It is well-structured, and dependencies on cryptography libraries are optional, with safe fallback.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard cryptographic utility functions with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign library for cryptographic signature processing and format detection, suitable for use in cryptography applications. No malicious behaviors or supply chain sabotage signals are detected.",
