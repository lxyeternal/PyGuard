  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding, decoding, and handling cryptographic data, including PEM and SSH key format detection.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data in the form of bytes or strings for encoding/decoding operations; functions take external data for processing such as keys or signatures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if sensitive data (keys, signatures) are mishandled or improperly exposed; no direct data sinks that send data externally are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys, signatures) flows through encoding/decoding functions, with transformations like base64url, DER/RAW conversions, and PEM detection; no external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. The code does perform cryptographic format detection, but no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident. The use of try-except for optional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for cryptographic data handling, including encoding/decoding, signature conversions, and format detection. Functions like 'force_bytes' and 'base64url_decode' are standard. The PEM and SSH key format detection functions use regular expressions to identify key formats, which is common. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import statements include optional cryptography modules, which is typical for cryptographic utilities. Overall, the code appears to be a benign cryptography utility library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard cryptographic utility module with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It performs encoding, decoding, and format detection for cryptographic keys and signatures. No malicious patterns, data leaks, or suspicious activities are present.",
