  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Validation**:  \n   All reports describe the code as a straightforward class definition:\n   ```python\n   class RemovedInPyjwt3Warning(DeprecationWarning):\n       pass\n   ```\n   This is a minimal, standard Python class declaration inheriting from `DeprecationWarning`. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or complex logic involved. The code appears correct and consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   None of the reports identify any errors or flaws. The code is simple and correct. No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or security issues are present.\n\n3. **Score Review and Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: All reports assign malware score 0, which is appropriate. The code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, since there's no evidence of security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Risk Score Evaluation**:  \n   All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code. No reason to increase this score.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports correctly assume that defining a class alone does not introduce vulnerabilities. No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   - The code is a standard, harmless class declaration for a custom warning.\n   - No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n   - The purpose is clear and aligns with typical deprecation warning practices.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI agree with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary. The code is safe and standard for defining custom warnings.",
