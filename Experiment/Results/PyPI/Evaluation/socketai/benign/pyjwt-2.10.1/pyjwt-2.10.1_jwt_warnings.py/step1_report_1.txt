  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines a class internally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares a class without interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class declaration with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of DeprecationWarning named RemovedInPyjwt3Warning. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for handling warnings related to deprecated PyJWT features. No input, output, or data handling occurs, and there are no complex or obfuscated constructs. The code is minimal and standard in purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple class definition for a custom warning type related to deprecated features in PyJWT. There is no malicious behavior or security concern evident.",
