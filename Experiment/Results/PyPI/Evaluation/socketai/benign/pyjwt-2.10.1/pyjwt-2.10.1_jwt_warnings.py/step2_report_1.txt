  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippets carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe the code as defining a class `RemovedInPyjwt3Warning` inheriting from `DeprecationWarning`.\n   - The code is minimal, with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - The code snippets are consistent and straightforward across all reports.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code does not contain any errors, flaws, or malicious constructs.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - The purpose is clearly to create a custom warning class, which is a common practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score of 1 indicates high certainty, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or assumptions about security issues.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no data flow or external dependencies.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, harmless class declaration for a custom warning.\n   - No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and comprehensive.**",
