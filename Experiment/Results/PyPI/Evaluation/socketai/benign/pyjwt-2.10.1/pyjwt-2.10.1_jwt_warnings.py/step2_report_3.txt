  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports describe the code as a straightforward class definition inheriting from `DeprecationWarning`, with no input/output, data flow, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard, and no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware score: 0  \n   - Security risk: 0  \n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1\n\n   These seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a class declaration for a warning, with no data handling, external interactions, or malicious logic, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted. The reports' scores align with this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There's no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard class declaration for a custom warning type. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and has no data flow or external interactions. The reports' evaluations are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security concerns. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
