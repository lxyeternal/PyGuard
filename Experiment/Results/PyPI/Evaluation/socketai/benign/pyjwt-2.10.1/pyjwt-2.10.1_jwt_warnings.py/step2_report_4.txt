  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal class definition: a subclass of DeprecationWarning named RemovedInPyjwt3Warning.\n- No input/output, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The purpose is to serve as a custom warning class for deprecated features in PyJWT v3.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description across all reports.\n- The class is straightforward and standard in Python for creating custom warnings.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- The code is minimal and correctly implemented for its purpose.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence score is 1, justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Potential Risks:**\n- Since the code is purely a class declaration with no malicious elements, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unwarranted.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior or obfuscation are warranted here.\n- The code is transparent and standard.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no security risks.\n- The purpose is solely to define a custom warning class.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
