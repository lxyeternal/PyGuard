  "purpose": "Define a custom warning class for deprecated features in the PyJWT library.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only defines a class without reading input or data.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code simply declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; straightforward class declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class inheriting from DeprecationWarning, intended to be used as a specific warning type for deprecated features related to PyJWT version 3. There are no input, output, or data flow mechanisms, nor any obfuscated or malicious code behavior. It appears to be a benign, standard practice for deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class declaration for a custom warning, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
