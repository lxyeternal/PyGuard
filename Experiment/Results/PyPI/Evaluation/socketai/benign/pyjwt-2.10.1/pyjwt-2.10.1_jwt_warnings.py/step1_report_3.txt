  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving sources and sinks exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a new warning class inheriting from DeprecationWarning, intended for signaling deprecation of features in PyJWT. It contains only a class declaration with a pass statement. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard Python for creating a custom warning class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a custom warning class. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
