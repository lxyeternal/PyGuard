  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \nAll reports describe a simple class definition: a subclass of `DeprecationWarning` named `RemovedInPyjwt3Warning`. The code's purpose is to serve as a custom warning class for deprecated features in PyJWT v3. There are no external data inputs, outputs, or complex logic involved. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Potential Issues or Anomalies**  \n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.  \n- The code is straightforward and standard in Python for creating custom warning classes.\n\n3. **Security & Malicious Behavior**  \n- No evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior is present.  \n- No external data handling, network interactions, or obfuscated code.  \n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning**  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.  \n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n- The malware score is 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n5. **Any Unreasonable Scores or Claims?**  \n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All claims are based on straightforward observations; no assumptions are made beyond the code's apparent purpose.\n\n7. **Overall Justification**  \n- The code is a minimal, standard class declaration for a custom warning, with no security concerns.  \n- The consistent assessment across reports is justified.\n\n**Final Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk)\n\n**Estimated Scores (My judgment):**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no security or malicious concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
