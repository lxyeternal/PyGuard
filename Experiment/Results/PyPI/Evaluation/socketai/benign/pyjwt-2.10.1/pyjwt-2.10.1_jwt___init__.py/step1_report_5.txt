{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata and imports functions, classes, and constants related to JSON Web Token (JWT) handling, including cryptographic key management, token encoding/decoding, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.api_jwk, .api_jws, .api_jwt, .exceptions, .jwks_client)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code only imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input, as this file contains only import statements and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The __version__, __author__, and contact info are standard metadata. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a series of classes, functions, and constants necessary for JWT operations and error handling. It establishes module metadata such as version, title, description, author, and license. No execution logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling occurs here. It appears to be a standard package initialization file (likely __init__.py) for a JWT library, with no signs of malicious code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard package setup and import module with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It merely prepares the package namespace for JWT functionality.",
