{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the module initializer for the PyJWT library, importing core components, exceptions, and setting metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static import statements and metadata definitions; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports modules and defines metadata without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, importing components and defining metadata. It contains no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. All signals indicate benign, static setup code with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
