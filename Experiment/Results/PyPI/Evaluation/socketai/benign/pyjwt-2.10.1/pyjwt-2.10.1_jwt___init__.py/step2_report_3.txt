  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a typical Python package __init__.py or module setup file.\n- It imports various components related to JWT handling, key management, and exceptions.\n- It defines package metadata (__version__, __title__, __author__, etc.).\n- It exports symbols via __all__.\n- There are no dynamic data flows, no input handling, no network operations, and no code obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and typical for a package initialization file.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Security risks:** No untrusted data processing, no code injection, no dynamic execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are apparent, as the code does not process data or execute logic beyond imports and metadata.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. The code functions as intended for a package __init__.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup, no security risks.\n\n**Justification for scores > 0.5:**\n- None are justified, as the code is purely setup and import statements with no suspicious activity.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The reports consistently identify the code as benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), and the assessments are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate; no additional risks or malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard module initialization file for the PyJWT library. It is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
