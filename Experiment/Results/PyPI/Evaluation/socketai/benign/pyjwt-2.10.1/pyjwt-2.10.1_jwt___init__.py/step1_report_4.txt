{
  "purpose": "This code primarily imports and re-exports modules and functions related to JSON Web Token (JWT) handling, key management, and exception handling for a Python JWT library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as .api_jwk, .api_jws, .api_jwt, .exceptions, and .jwks_client, as well as metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "Exports via __all__, exposing functions, classes, and exceptions for external use.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data input sources or data sinks are explicitly present within this code; it mainly consolidates imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. All code is standard for a library's __init__.py or module aggregation file.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an entry point or module aggregator for the JWT library, importing and exposing necessary classes and functions. There are no data inputs, dynamic code execution, or network operations present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The metadata and exports are standard and do not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard library setup file for a JWT implementation, primarily handling imports and module exposure. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
