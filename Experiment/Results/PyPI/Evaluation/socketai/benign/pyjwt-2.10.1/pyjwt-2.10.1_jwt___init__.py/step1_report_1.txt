{
  "purpose": "This module imports various components and exceptions related to JSON Web Token (JWT) handling in Python, primarily for encoding, decoding, and managing cryptographic keys.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; imports are from internal modules and external dependencies, and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially harmful effects; primarily imports and metadata definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module exports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The version, author, and license info are static metadata. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, module-level metadata, and an export list (__all__). It does not process or handle external data directly. No code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious activity is evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, establishing namespace exports and metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization file for a JWT library, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It merely imports and exposes components for JWT operations.",
