  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for reading files and extracting version information from a specified file, primarily used in project configuration and documentation setup.",
  "sources": "File reading operations via open() in read() function, which reads local files based on constructed paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads local files and processes their content with regex, without transmitting or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "read() function reads a file and passes its content to find_version(), which uses regex to extract the __version__ string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard library usage, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads local files to retrieve version information using safe, standard practices. No external data, network communication, or dynamic execution is present. The regex pattern is simple and safe. The code is static, transparent, and does not handle secrets or credentials. Given its purpose as a configuration utility, it poses negligible security risks and contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility script for project configuration and documentation purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with minimal file I/O activities typical in such scripts.",
