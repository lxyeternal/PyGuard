  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script with utility functions for reading files and extracting version info.\n- No reports identify any suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n- The functions are straightforward, using standard Python libraries (os, re) with no external data inputs or network activity.\n- The code does not process untrusted data into critical sinks, nor does it perform dynamic code execution, network communication, or secret handling.\n- The version extraction via regex from a local file is common practice and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears benign; no issues are present.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as safe and standard.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low scores (0 or 0.1), which seems reasonable considering the code's purpose.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The risk score of 0.1 in report 1 might be slightly high if we consider any code that reads files as inherently low risk, but since the code only reads local files for version info, this is acceptable.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; no obfuscation or hidden logic is present.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- No adjustments needed; scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable for a very low risk configuration script)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard configuration script with utility functions for reading files and extracting version info. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for minimal risk associated with file I/O, but effectively negligible)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
