  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads files, extracts version info.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data flows; straightforward file read and regex extraction.  \n- **Anomalies:** None observed; standard code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign utility code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with focus on standard file reading and version extraction.  \n- No suspicious activity or external data processing.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: reading version info from a file, no external communication.  \n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the same benign pattern: static file reading, regex parsing, no external activity.  \n- No suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous analyses: configuration code, safe file I/O, no external threats.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle secrets.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security concerns, a very low risk score (close to 0) is justified.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores should reflect this, confirming a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score.",
