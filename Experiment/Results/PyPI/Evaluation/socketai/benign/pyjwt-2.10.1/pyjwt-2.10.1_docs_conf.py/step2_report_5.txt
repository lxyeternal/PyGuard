  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists of straightforward file reading, regex extraction of a version string, and static configuration for Sphinx documentation.\n- No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input beyond reading local files.\n- The functions are simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The regex pattern used for version extraction is standard and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; functions read files and extract version.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data or sensitive sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0.1 — very low, acceptable.\n  \n**Verdict:** Sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same reasoning; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same assessment; the code is a standard configuration utility.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low risk (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n### **Final justification:**\n\n- The code is purely static configuration and utility functions.\n- No external data, network, or dynamic code execution.\n- Regex and file I/O are safe and standard.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the file I/O nature, but very low.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No modifications are necessary. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code correctly.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0**         | **0**            | **0.1**   |\n\nThe code is safe, non-obfuscated, and poses negligible security risk.",
