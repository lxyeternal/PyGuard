  "purpose": "Cryptographic key management and validation for JSON Web Keys (JWKs).",
  "sources": "Reading 'kty', 'alg', 'crv', 'kid', and 'use' fields from the JWK data; invoking Algorithm.from_jwk for key creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; key creation and validation are internal and do not involve external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input data (JWK dict) flows into validation and key creation functions; no external data flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Exception handling is standard; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic key parsing, validation, and object creation. It checks for required fields, raises appropriate exceptions for missing or unsupported parameters, and handles cryptography dependencies correctly. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. The use of Algorithm.from_jwk is typical for cryptographic key handling. Exception handling and validation are appropriate, and no network or external data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for managing JWKs with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily reflecting the inherent risks in cryptographic key handling but not indicating malicious activity.",
