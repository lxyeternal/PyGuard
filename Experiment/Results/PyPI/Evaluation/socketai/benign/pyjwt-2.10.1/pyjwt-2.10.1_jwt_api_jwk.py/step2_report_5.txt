  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles JWKs securely, with proper validation, exception handling, and no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's functionality. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified given the nature of cryptographic key management.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proper validation, exception handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The only potential concern could be the use of `Algorithm.from_jwk`, but since this is standard cryptographic library usage, it doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on parsing, validation, and safe key creation. No malicious activity or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score than others, which seems appropriate given the straightforward cryptographic key handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard cryptographic practices with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard cryptographic key management, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's purpose and no malicious indicators, these are reasonable. A slightly higher score (e.g., 0.2) is justified due to the potential misuse of cryptographic keys if misconfigured, but no evidence of such misuse exists here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** I would suggest a uniform risk score of **0.2** across all reports, reflecting a low but non-zero baseline risk associated with cryptographic key handling, especially if keys are misused or misconfigured.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, legitimate implementation for managing JWKs.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores are reasonable; minor adjustment to risk scores to a consistent 0.2 is recommended for clarity.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
