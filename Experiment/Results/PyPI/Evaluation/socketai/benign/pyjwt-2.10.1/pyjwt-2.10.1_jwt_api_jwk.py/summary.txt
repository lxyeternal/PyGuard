  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for managing JWKs with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is low (~0.2), primarily reflecting the inherent risks in cryptographic key handling but not indicating malicious activity."
