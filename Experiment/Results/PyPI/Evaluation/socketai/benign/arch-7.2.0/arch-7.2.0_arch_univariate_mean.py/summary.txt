  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of ARCH family models with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It is safe for use in production environments. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with standard open-source statistical modeling code."
