{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations for various univariate ARCH models, including mean models, estimation, simulation, and forecast functions, primarily for financial time series analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as y, x, params, and configuration arguments; no external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be written to outputs like DataFrames and forecasts, but these are derived solely from model inputs and internal computations without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into model calculations, residuals, likelihood functions, and forecast outputs; no external system or network calls are made.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard modeling procedures with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several statistical models for time series data, including their simulation, estimation, and forecasting routines. It uses standard numerical and statistical methods (e.g., matrix inversion, regression, likelihood calculations) and leverages numpy, pandas, and scipy. No parts of the code execute system commands, network operations, or access external resources. The model functions operate on data passed as arguments and produce outputs based solely on mathematical computations. There are no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. Usage of distribution and volatility classes appears standard and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of univariate ARCH family models with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a standard statistical package code, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It operates within the expected scope of a financial time series modeling library.",
