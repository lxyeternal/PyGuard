{
  "purpose": "The code defines various statistical models for time series analysis, specifically ARCH and mean models, including methods for fitting, simulation, and forecasting, primarily used for financial data modeling.",
  "sources": "Input data such as 'y' (dependent variable), 'x' (exogenous regressors), parameters for model estimation, and external distribution or volatility objects.",
  "sinks": "Generated forecast paths, residuals, simulated data, and model parameters; no direct sinks indicating untrusted data handling or malicious effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables into model fitting and simulation methods; parameters are parsed and used to generate residuals, forecasts, and simulated data. No suspicious data flow paths such as network transmission or hidden data exfiltration are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, hidden network operations, or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard statistical and numerical operations, with clear parameter handling and model logic.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements time series models with standard practices for parameter estimation, simulation, and forecasting. It includes careful input validation, handling of model specifications, and use of external libraries like numpy, pandas, and scipy. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The functions serve well-understood modeling purposes with transparent data flow. No hidden or obfuscated behavior is evident, and all code appears to be legitimate statistical modeling logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of ARCH and mean models used in financial time series analysis. It adheres to standard practices without signs of malicious intent or sabotage. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected, and the code is primarily concerned with model estimation, simulation, and forecasting in a transparent manner.",
