{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and provides a function to open a documentation URL in a web browser.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules, the version information, and a URL string within the doc() function.",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.open() function is a sink, executing an external process to open a web page.",
  "flows": "The doc() function flows from calling the function to executing webbrowser.open() with a fixed URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. The URL is hardcoded but benign. No unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module exports and includes a single function that opens a documentation webpage. The webbrowser.open() call is straightforward and uses a fixed, trusted URL. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no code injection points, and no malicious logic detected. The rest of the code is standard import/export statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical module setup and providing a convenience function for opening documentation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
