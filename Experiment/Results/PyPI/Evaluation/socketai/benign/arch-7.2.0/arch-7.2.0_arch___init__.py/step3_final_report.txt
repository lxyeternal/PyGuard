{
  "purpose": "Provides package version info, a univariate mean model, and a test utility; includes a documentation helper function.",
  "sources": "The import statements for version, model, and test; the webbrowser.open() call in the doc() function.",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.open() call potentially triggers opening a URL in the user's browser.",
  "flows": "The doc() function calls webbrowser.open() with a fixed URL; no other data flows or untrusted inputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal variables and functions, defines a simple doc() function that opens a static URL, and exposes certain variables via __all__. There are no external inputs, no data transmission, and no obfuscation. The only sink is opening a fixed URL, which is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1) due to the URL opening, which is standard for documentation purposes. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only action is opening a static URL via webbrowser, which is benign. The assigned scores are consistent with its behavior, and no further action is required.",
