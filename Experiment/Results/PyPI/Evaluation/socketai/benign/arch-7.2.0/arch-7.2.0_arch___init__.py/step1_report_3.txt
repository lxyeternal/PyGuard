{
  "purpose": "The code exports modules and functions related to statistical modeling, and provides a documentation function that opens a URL in a web browser.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the 'doc' function, which calls webbrowser.open() with a hardcoded URL.",
  "sinks": "webbrowser.open() call with a fixed URL.",
  "flows": "From the 'doc' function (source) to webbrowser.open() (sink), which is executed when 'doc()' is called.",
  "anomalies": "The 'doc' function directly opens a URL in the user's default web browser. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components for exposing package metadata and functions. The 'doc' function, when invoked, opens a specified URL in the user's web browser, likely for documentation or informational purposes. This is a common pattern in Python packages to provide easy access to online docs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The URL is static and publicly accessible. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present. The overall structure and content appear standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with a simple documentation helper. There is no malicious intent or security risk detected based on the provided code.",
