{
  "purpose": "This code is for a Python package module, exposing certain functions and variables, and providing a documentation helper that opens a URL in a web browser.",
  "sources": "The code imports version info, a model function, a test utility, and a web browser module; no external inputs are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.open() call can trigger opening a URL in the user's default browser; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The function 'doc' can be invoked to open a URL in the web browser; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns; the webbrowser call is benign but may be used to redirect user to external site.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports variables and functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. The 'doc' function, when called, opens a web page, which is a benign utility function. No input data is processed or transmitted, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The webbrowser invocation is a user-initiated action to access documentation, not malicious. There are no obfuscations, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module for a Python package, exposing core functions and version info, with a utility to open documentation in a browser. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
