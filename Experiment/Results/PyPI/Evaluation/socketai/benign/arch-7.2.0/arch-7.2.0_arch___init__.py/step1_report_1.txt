{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions and variables related to a Python package, including version info, a model, and utility functions. It also provides a documentation function that opens a URL in a web browser.",
  "sources": "The only data source is the import statements, which load modules and variables; no external input or data reading occurs at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The `webbrowser.open()` call is a sink that can potentially open arbitrary URLs, but it is hardcoded to a specific URL for documentation purposes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the only flow is the execution of a hardcoded URL when the `doc()` function is called.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The only notable feature is the `webbrowser.open()` call, which is typical for documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily exports variables and functions related to the package, with no user input processing or external data handling. The `doc()` function opens a fixed documentation URL in the default web browser, which is benign and standard practice for packages to provide documentation access. No malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or suspicious network activity, is present. The import statements are typical and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module with no indications of malicious behavior. The only action performed is opening a documentation URL via the `webbrowser` module, which is benign. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
