  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of ARCH models with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal use of print and warning statements does not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code content."
