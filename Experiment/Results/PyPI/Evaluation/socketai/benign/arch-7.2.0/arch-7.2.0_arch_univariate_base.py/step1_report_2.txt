{
  "purpose": "This code defines abstract classes and helper functions for modeling and forecasting in ARCH models, including result summarization and plotting utilities.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from attributes such as 'y', 'resids', 'resid', 'conditional_volatility', and forecast outputs. It also reads parameters for model fitting and simulation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging or printing in the _callback function, warnings issued during model fitting, and plotting functions that use external libraries (matplotlib). There is no evidence of data leaks or malicious data exfiltration. No network or system calls are made to suspicious domains.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through model attributes for residuals and volatility calculations, with constraints and bounds used during optimization. Results are summarized, formatted, and plotted. There are no flows to external untrusted systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. Usage of warnings and debug print statements in callback functions is standard for numerical optimization processes. No obfuscation, malicious encoding, or hidden behaviors are present. The code employs standard practices for modeling and reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of ARCH modeling components, including base classes, result containers, and forecasting utilities. It contains typical functions for constraints, bounds, likelihood calculations, and plotting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, system tampering, or data exfiltration. Usage of warnings, printing, and plotting is consistent with standard modeling workflows. No suspicious data flows or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of ARCH model classes and associated utilities for modeling, fitting, and forecasting. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe to use from a supply chain security perspective.",
