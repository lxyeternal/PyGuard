{
  "purpose": "The provided code defines core classes and functions for an ARCH modeling framework, including model estimation, forecasting, and result summarization, primarily for financial time series analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from attributes such as y, residuals, and model parameters; also reads from configuration functions, optimizer callbacks, and imported libraries. External input could come from user-provided data for model fitting or forecasting.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be introduced via parameters in functions such as fit(), forecast(), or fix(), affecting calculations or results. No explicit data leaks, network communication, or malicious side-effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (y, parameters, residuals) flow into model methods for estimation, residual calculation, and likelihood computation. The optimizer's callback and constraints are used during fitting. Results and forecasts are generated from these flows, with no evident data exfiltration or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are present. The code employs standard numerical and statistical libraries for model estimation and forecasting. No unusual or misleading code constructs are identified. No cryptic or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured framework for ARCH models with methods for fitting, forecasting, residual analysis, and result summarization. It uses well-known libraries like numpy, pandas, scipy, and statsmodels, with standard design patterns. No network operations, system modifications, or malicious code are present. Callbacks and warnings are used appropriately, and data handling appears transparent and safe. All functions perform expected statistical operations, and no suspicious data flows or hidden mechanisms are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of ARCH modeling components with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or harmful behaviors. It relies on standard numerical and statistical practices without any covert or malicious side-effects.",
