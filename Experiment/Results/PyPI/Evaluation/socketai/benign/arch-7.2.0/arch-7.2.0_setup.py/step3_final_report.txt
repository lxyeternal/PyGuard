  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for building the 'arch' Python package with optional Cython extensions, environment-based configuration, and package data collection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ARCH_CYTHON_COVERAGE, ARCH_NO_BINARY), file reads (README.md, directory walk for package data), imports (setuptools, os, fnmatch, numpy, Cython.Build).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; build process executes code based on environment variables but does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence build configuration and extension compilation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; build process executes with controlled inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of environment variables is standard for build customization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package, managing optional Cython extension compilation, handling errors gracefully, and collecting package data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Environment variables are used solely for configuration, which is common practice. Error handling and fallback mechanisms are appropriate. The code does not perform any network activity or data leaks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The use of environment variables for build options is typical and does not introduce security risks. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero, and the low risk score reflects minimal concern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use.",
