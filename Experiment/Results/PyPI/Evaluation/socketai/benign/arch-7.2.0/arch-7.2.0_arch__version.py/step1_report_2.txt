{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and handles type annotations conditionally.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version data from hardcoded strings to variables and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, static, and primarily for metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version metadata with conditional type annotations depending on the TYPE_CHECKING flag. It uses hardcoded version strings and tuples, which are typical for package versioning. There are no inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no sensitive data handling. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic behavior that could indicate malicious intent. Its purpose is solely to define version information in a structured manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard autogenerated version metadata snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as package metadata only.",
