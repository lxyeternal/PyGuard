  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, without performing any functional operations.",
  "sources": "Static version string assignment and type checking block; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and follows common patterns for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables using static strings and type hints, generated by a tool (setuptools_scm). It contains no runtime data processing, external inputs, or suspicious logic. The presence of type checking block is standard for type hinting support. Overall, it is a benign, auto-generated version declaration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for version tracking and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard, auto-generated version file with no security concerns.",
