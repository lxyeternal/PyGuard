  "purpose": "Static version metadata assignment generated by setuptools_scm, used for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard auto-generated version info code with conditional type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static snippet for version information, with no dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious constructs. It contains only hardcoded version strings and tuples, with a common pattern for type checking. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is benign and serves solely as metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and contains no security threats or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
