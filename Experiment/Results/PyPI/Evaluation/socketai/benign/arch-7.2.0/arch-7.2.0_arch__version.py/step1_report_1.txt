{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage and track package versioning.",
  "sources": "Version strings and tuples assigned directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or potential data leaks; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment of version information.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a standard pattern for versioning with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, including __version__, version, and version_tuple, using static values. It includes a conditional block based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is a common pattern to provide type hints without affecting runtime. No external input is read, no untrusted data is processed, and no dynamic code execution is present. The code is purely for version management and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe versioning stub generated by setuptools_scm. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is standard boilerplate for version tracking in Python packages.",
