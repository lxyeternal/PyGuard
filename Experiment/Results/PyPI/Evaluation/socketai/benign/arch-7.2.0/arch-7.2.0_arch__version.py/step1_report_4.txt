{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and type checking.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ and version) from hardcoded string '7.2.0'; the conditional import of typing modules for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None. There are no untrusted data inputs or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A. The data flow is limited to static variable assignments and type annotation imports, with no user input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, involving version metadata definitions with no unusual constructs or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information using static assignments and conditional imports for type checking. No external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data are involved. There are no apparent security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for package versioning metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, straightforward version information code with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely defines package version variables with no external interactions.",
