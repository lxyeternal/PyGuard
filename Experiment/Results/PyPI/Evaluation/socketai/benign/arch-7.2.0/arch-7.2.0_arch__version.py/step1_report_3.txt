  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static values assigned directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input; no data leaks or harmful effects present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; straightforward assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments indicating auto-generation and version control handling; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables for a Python package, using static assignments with no external input, data manipulation, or malicious logic. The use of type checking conditionals is standard for type hinting purposes. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be auto-generated, as noted by the comments, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration snippet for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
