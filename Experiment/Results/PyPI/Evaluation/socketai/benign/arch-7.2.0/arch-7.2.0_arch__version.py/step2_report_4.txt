  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning provided, and the scoring assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard boilerplate for version management, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and contains no dynamic or external data handling.\n- The scores assigned are consistently zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The version string `'7.2.0'` and tuple `(7, 2, 0)` are hardcoded.\n- The conditional `if TYPE_CHECKING:` is a common pattern for type hints, with no impact on runtime behavior.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or sinks are present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment; no errors are evident.\n- The reasoning correctly identifies the code as benign and auto-generated.\n- The scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Scores:\n- The **malware score (0)** is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score (0)** is correct; no obfuscation or hidden behavior.\n- The **security risk score (0)** is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code is purely static, contains no external data handling, and is auto-generated, there's no basis for increasing the scores.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, given the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe versioning stub with no security issues. The scores are reasonable and justified. No changes are necessary.",
