  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of import statements from the 'arch' package, involving modules for univariate time series, volatility, distributions, and a conditional import for 'recursions' with fallback to 'recursions_python'.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup or initialization script for a package, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The fallback pattern for 'recursions' is a common practice to ensure compatibility or optional dependency handling.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and all reports agree that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code. It is a straightforward import setup.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports assign zero scores, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are claimed or implied; the code is static import statements.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is not doing anything malicious or suspicious.\n- The fallback import pattern is standard and safe.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent in their assessment. The code is a benign, standard module setup for the 'arch' package, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score  |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Malware            | 0       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       |\n| Risk               | 0       |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a typical import setup for a well-known open-source library.",
