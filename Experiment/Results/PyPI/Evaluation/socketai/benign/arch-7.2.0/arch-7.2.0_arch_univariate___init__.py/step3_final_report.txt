  "purpose": "This code sets up module imports for the 'arch' package, including classes, functions, and a fallback import for 'recursions'. It prepares the package's public API via the __all__ list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'arch.univariate' modules and the conditional import of 'recursions' or 'recursions_python'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns them to the namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard import setup with a common fallback pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from a well-known library, with a fallback import pattern for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The structure is typical for package initialization scripts, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. It is a standard setup for a Python package, importing modules and defining the public API. All indicators confirm its safety.",
