{
  "purpose": "The code defines various classes for volatility processes used in financial modeling, including simulation, forecasting, and parameter estimation for models like GARCH, EGARCH, FIGARCH, and related processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from residuals (resids), parameters, and user inputs such as backcast values and bounds. It also sources random numbers via rng functions and inputs for simulation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of rng functions for stochastic simulations, and the possible inclusion of user-provided backcast and parameters. No direct data leaks or harmful effects are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from residuals and parameters into compute_variance methods; stochastic simulation flows from rng functions to generate residuals and variance paths; forecasting methods use computed variances and residuals to produce forecasts. User inputs like backcast values and bounds are transformed and used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. All functions perform standard calculations for volatility modeling. The use of stochastic functions (rng) is consistent with simulation practices; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to implement well-established models without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements a variety of volatility models with methods for computation, simulation, bounds, and forecasts. No suspicious I/O, hidden commands, or malicious data handling are identified. The stochastic functions (rng) are used in simulations, which is standard. All code behavior aligns with common financial modeling practices. The code structure is clean, and no anomalies such as suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of volatility models for financial data analysis. It follows standard practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious data handling. The stochastic and data inputs are used appropriately for modeling and simulation purposes only. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
