  "purpose": "Configure pytest environment and pandas copy-on-write setting based on environment variable.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ARCH_TEST_COPY_ON_WRITE', os.environ.get() call, pytest configuration functions, logging statements.",
  "sinks": "Logging output, pandas configuration setting, pytest test skipping logic.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read influences pandas setting; logging outputs status; pytest functions modify test execution flow based on markers and options.",
  "anomalies": "Environment variable 'ARCH_TEST_COPY_ON_WRITE' is fetched with bool(os.environ.get(..., False)), which may not correctly interpret string values like 'False' or '0'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest setup script that reads an environment variable to toggle pandas' copy-on-write mode, logs the status, and configures test options and skipping logic. No untrusted data, network activity, or credential handling is present. The environment variable handling could be improved for clarity, but it does not introduce security issues. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the environment variable parsing method, which can be clarified but does not impact security. Overall, the code poses no security risks and is correctly scored.",
