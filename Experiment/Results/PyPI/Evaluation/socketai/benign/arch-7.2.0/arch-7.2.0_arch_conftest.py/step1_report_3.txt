  "purpose": "Configure and customize pytest testing framework with environment-based options and logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ARCH_TEST_COPY_ON_WRITE', and import statements for modules like os, logging, pandas, pytest.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external sources, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Environment variable affects pandas configuration; no user input or untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of environment variable to toggle pandas copy_on_write mode is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging, checks an environment variable to configure pandas, and integrates pytest configuration options. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity is evident. The code is straightforward, focusing on test configuration. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing solely on testing setup and configuration. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
