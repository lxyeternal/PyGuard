  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing framework and set pandas copy-on-write mode based on environment variable",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ARCH_TEST_COPY_ON_WRITE', and code reading module imports and configuration functions",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; configuration functions influence test execution flow",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences pandas setting; configuration functions influence pytest test execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard use of environment variables, logging, and pytest configuration",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, configures pandas options based on an environment variable, and sets up pytest configurations including custom command-line options and test markers. It uses environment variables and logging, but no user input, untrusted data, or potentially malicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest and pandas configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
