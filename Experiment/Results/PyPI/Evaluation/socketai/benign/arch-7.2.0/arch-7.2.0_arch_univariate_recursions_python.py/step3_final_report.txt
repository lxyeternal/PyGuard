  "purpose": "Implementation of core recursion functions for volatility models such as GARCH, EGARCH, MIDAS, FIGARCH, APARCH, etc., primarily used for testing and estimation in financial time series analysis.",
  "sources": "Arrays of residuals, residual signs, residual squares, model parameters, bounds, and weights used as input for recursive calculations.",
  "sinks": "In-place updates to arrays of conditional variances; no external data flow, network activity, or file I/O detected.",
  "flows": "Sequential source-to-sink updates within recursive functions, utilizing residuals and parameters to compute variances at each time step.",
  "anomalies": "Default placeholder values such as -1.0 in some classes and large constants like 9999.99 in EGARCHUpdater are typical initializations, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical formulas for volatility recursion models, optimized with numba jit for performance. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of typical placeholders for initial backcast values is standard practice in such models. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of volatility recursion models used in financial analysis. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor default placeholder values are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
