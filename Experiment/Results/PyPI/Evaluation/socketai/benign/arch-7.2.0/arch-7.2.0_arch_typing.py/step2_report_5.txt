  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily composed of import statements, type alias definitions, and constants.\n- No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup module for type annotations in a data science or scientific computing context.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description: it's a static, type-focused module with no executable logic or external data handling.\n   - No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - They consistently note the absence of suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, which is justified.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No such scores are assigned; all are 0, which is correct.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware score remains 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely type and constant definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a benign setup module for type annotations and constants.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
