  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code consists solely of import statements, type alias definitions, and constant declarations.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network communication.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The purpose appears to be setting up type annotations and constants for a data analysis or scientific computing library.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review**\n\n#### **1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, with no dynamic or external operations.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports note no obfuscation, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n#### **2. Potential Vulnerabilities or Security Risks**\n\n- **Type Aliases & Constants:** These are standard and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- **Data Handling:** No input/output, data processing, or external communication.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is correct.\n\n#### **3. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- **Accuracy of Analysis:** All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- **Score Justification:** The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable given the code.\n\n#### **4. Score Reasonableness & Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** All reports show high confidence (1.0), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Additional Considerations:** No changes needed; the code is benign and purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### **My Expert Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
