  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security concerns, malware indicators, obfuscation, and logical flaws.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a collection of type aliases, constants, and imports for data science or scientific computing.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, external data sources, or network communication are present.\n- The code is static, declarative, and standard for type annotations and constants.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified in any report.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the description: it only defines type aliases, imports, and constants.\n- No code performs any operation beyond static type annotations.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- None detected. The code is straightforward and standard for its purpose.\n- The type aliases are correctly defined.\n- The imports are appropriate and safe.\n- The constants and literal types are standard and unremarkable.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is purely declarative with no executable logic.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or network operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious code.\n- The type annotations are standard and necessary for type checking in larger codebases.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a benign, standard setup module for type annotations and constants in a data analysis library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, clear, and intended for type safety in a scientific computing context. No security concerns or malicious behavior are present.",
