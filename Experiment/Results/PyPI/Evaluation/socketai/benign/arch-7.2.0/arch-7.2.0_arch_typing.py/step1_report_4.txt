{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and constants for a numerical and data analysis library, likely used for scientific or statistical computations.",
  "sources": "There are no input sources or external data reading in this code; it only declares types and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process or handle external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks because no input processing or data manipulation occurs beyond type aliasing and constant declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be standard type definitions and constants for a data analysis context.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines type aliases, constants, and literal types used for static type checking and documentation. It imports standard libraries and popular data science packages but does not execute any logic or handle external inputs. There are no code injection points, no network calls, no cryptic or dynamic code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms. The structure and content are typical for a well-organized type definition module in a scientific computing package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely declarative, and contains no malicious behavior. It is designed for type safety and clarity in a larger codebase. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
