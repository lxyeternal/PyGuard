  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type aliases, imports, and constants for data analysis. No untrusted data, external communication, or sensitive data handling is detected. No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is static, purely for type annotations and constants, with no executable logic or data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct, no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role in defining types and constants for data handling, with no data sources or sinks, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard setup for data types and constants, with no external data or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code contains no dynamic logic or external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines types and constants, no input/output or external data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. It is a typical type annotation module.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—type aliases, constants, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely static, defining types and constants.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; no dynamic code, no network, no file I/O, no obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code does not process or handle external data or perform any operations beyond type annotations.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe module for type annotations and constants in a data analysis context. No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
