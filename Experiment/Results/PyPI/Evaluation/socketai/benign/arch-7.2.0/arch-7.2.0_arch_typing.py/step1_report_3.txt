{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases, import modules, and set constants for a data analysis or scientific computing library.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc, datetime, typing, numpy, pandas; definitions of type aliases and constants.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input or data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily sets up type annotations and constants without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for a type annotation and constant definition module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party packages, then defines various type aliases for numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames/Series, and other types used for data analysis. It includes no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no suspicious logic. All elements are typical for a type definitions module intended for use in larger data processing codebases. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module for defining types and constants for data analysis tasks. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
