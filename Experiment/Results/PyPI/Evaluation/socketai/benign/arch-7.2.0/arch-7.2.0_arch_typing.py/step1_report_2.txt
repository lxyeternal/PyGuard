{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases, imports, and constants primarily for data handling, numerical computations, and pandas data structures in a larger data analysis or statistical modeling project.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources, user input, or external data read functions present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data manipulation or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static type and constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Use of type aliases and data structure definitions is standard. No dynamic code execution, no network or file operations, no credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly composed of import statements, type alias definitions, and constant declarations for use in numerical and data analysis contexts. There are no functions, class definitions, or executable statements that could perform malicious actions. It appears to be a standard type and constant setup module. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code structure and content are consistent with a typical, benign data science or numerical computation package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for defining data types and constants to support larger data processing or analysis codebases.",
