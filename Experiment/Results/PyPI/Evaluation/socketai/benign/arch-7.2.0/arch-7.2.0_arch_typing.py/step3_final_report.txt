{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases, constants, and imports for data analysis and scientific computing, serving as a static setup module for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, constant declarations",
  "sinks": "None; static declarations with no data input/output or external communication",
  "flows": "None; no runtime data flow, only type annotations and constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for its purpose",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, type alias definitions, and constants for data types and configurations. It does not process external data, perform I/O, or execute logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for setting up type annotations in a data science context, with no dynamic or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely static, and intended for type safety. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
