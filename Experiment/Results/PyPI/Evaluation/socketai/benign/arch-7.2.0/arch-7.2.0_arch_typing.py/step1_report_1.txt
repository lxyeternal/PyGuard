{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases, import necessary modules, and declare constants for a data analysis or scientific computation library.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc, datetime, typing, numpy, pandas; variable definitions and type alias declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external communication, or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type and constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code strictly defines types and imports modules without executing harmful operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules used in data science. It declares numerous type aliases for numpy arrays, pandas objects, and literals, which are typical in scientific computing. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present. All code appears to be for type annotations and constants, with no signs of malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for type definitions and constants, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and intended for use in data analysis or scientific computation context.",
