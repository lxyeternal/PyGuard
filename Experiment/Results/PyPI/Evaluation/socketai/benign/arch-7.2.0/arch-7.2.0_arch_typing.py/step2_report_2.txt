  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of import statements, type alias definitions, and constant declarations.\n- No functions, class definitions, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- The code is static, declarative, and typical for a type annotation module in data science or scientific computing projects.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or dynamic execution.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.0, malware scores of 0, and security risks of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Data flow or external communication:** Not applicable.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None based on assumptions; the code is purely type and constant definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\nThe reasoning in each report is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I agree with the assessments provided.** The code is a standard, safe, and non-malicious module for type annotations and constants, with no security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign setup module for type annotations and constants, with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the content.",
