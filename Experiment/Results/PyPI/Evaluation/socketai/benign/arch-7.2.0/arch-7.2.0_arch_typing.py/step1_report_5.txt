{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and constants for numerical and data manipulation, primarily for use with numpy and pandas.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections.abc, datetime, typing, numpy, pandas.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing, no data leaks, no external communications or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets type definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The code is straightforward type annotation and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for data processing and type annotations, then defines various type aliases for numpy arrays, pandas objects, and other data types. It uses standard type hints and constants, with no evidence of code execution, data handling from external sources, or dynamic code. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for type annotations and constants setup; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger data processing library.",
