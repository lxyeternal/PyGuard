  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to httpx-oauth operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from input parameters in exception constructors, specifically error messages and optional httpx.Response objects.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with message strings and optional response objects, mainly for error handling and logging purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward exception class definitions without any unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for HTTPX OAuth errors. It accepts messages and response objects but does not perform any risky operations such as network requests, data manipulation, or dynamic code execution. The response parameter is optional and not used in a way that could cause security issues. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for error handling in an OAuth context, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
