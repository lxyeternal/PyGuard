  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to httpx-oauth operations.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; code defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception classes do not process or handle data beyond storing error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with structured error messages and optional response objects. It appears to be a straightforward error handling setup for an OAuth-related library. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No suspicious logic or code execution methods are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural for error handling with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is standard exception class definition with no anomalies.",
