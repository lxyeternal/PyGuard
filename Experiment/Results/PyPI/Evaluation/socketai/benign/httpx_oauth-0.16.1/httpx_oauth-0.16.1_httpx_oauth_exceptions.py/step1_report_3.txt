  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to httpx-oauth operations.",
  "sources": "Constants and class initializations; error message strings; httpx.Response object (potentially untrusted data source).",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and message passing; storing response object as an attribute.",
  "flows": "Error creation -> Exception instantiation -> Superclass initialization -> Response object stored as attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is straightforward, standard Python exception handling with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for OAuth-related errors. It initializes error messages and optionally stores an httpx.Response object in the exception for further context. The code does not process or handle untrusted input directly; response objects are stored as attributes but not used insecurely. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard exception handling structure for OAuth errors with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines error classes used for error reporting in OAuth workflows.",
