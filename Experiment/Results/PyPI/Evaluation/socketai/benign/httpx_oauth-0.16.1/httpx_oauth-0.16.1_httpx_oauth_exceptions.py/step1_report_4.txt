  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to httpx-oauth operations, specifically errors in retrieving user profile and ID/email information.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through parameters in exception initializers, specifically error messages and optional httpx.Response objects.",
  "sinks": "Exception initialization and raising mechanisms, primarily the super().__init__ calls with error messages.",
  "flows": "Error message parameters flow into base Exception class; Response objects are stored but not processed further.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious activity detected. The code is straightforward exception handling classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with added attributes for error messages and optional HTTP response data. It appears to be standard error handling for an HTTP client library, without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in an OAuth context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
