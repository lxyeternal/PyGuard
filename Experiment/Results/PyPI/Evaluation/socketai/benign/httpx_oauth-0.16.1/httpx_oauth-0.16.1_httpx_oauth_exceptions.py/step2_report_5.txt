  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes for an OAuth-related Python library.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is straightforward class definitions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - Response objects are stored as attributes but not used maliciously.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The exception classes are well-structured, with optional response attributes for context.\n   - The code aligns with standard Python exception handling patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, justified by the benign nature.\n   - Confidence is 1, reflecting high certainty.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about malicious activity are justified; the code is purely structural.\n   - No code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The exception classes are standard and do not process untrusted data in a risky way.\n- The response objects are stored for context but not used insecurely.\n- The overall design is typical for error handling modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Final remark:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the report evaluations are correct.",
