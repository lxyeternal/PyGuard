{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling OAuth-related errors, storing error messages and optional HTTP response context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'message' and optional 'response' in exception class constructors.",
  "sinks": "None; exception classes only store data without processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes; no external data processing or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, designed to encapsulate error messages and optional HTTP response objects. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The response objects are stored as attributes but not used insecurely. The code is standard, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for an OAuth library. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
