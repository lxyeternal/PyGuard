  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's security posture, logic, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\nThe provided code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling errors in an httpx-oauth library. The classes include:\n- `HTTPXOAuthError` (base class)\n- `GetProfileError`\n- `GetIdEmailError`\n\nThey store error messages and optionally an `httpx.Response` object for context. The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external data handling, or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code matches the description and appears correct.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The exception classes are well-structured, standard, and do not contain vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Scores given in reports?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes for httpx-oauth errors.\n- **Findings:** No data sources, sinks, or flows that could cause security issues. No anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or security risks.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No data processing or external data handling beyond storing response objects.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes with optional response objects.\n- **Findings:** Response objects are stored but not used insecurely.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Error classes for retrieving user profile and email.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or code injection.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No security concerns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No risky operations, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network requests, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely structural for error handling with no vulnerabilities, all scores are appropriately zero.\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard exception handling classes with no security risks. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action or concern is necessary. The code is safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
