  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for an OAuth-related library utilizing httpx.\n- Exception classes carry error messages and optionally store an httpx.Response object.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code matches the description in all reports: it's a set of exception classes for error handling.\n- No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks are evident.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not process untrusted data in a harmful way.\n- The response object is stored as an attribute but not used insecurely.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Issue Presence:\n- The issues reported (malware, obfuscation, security risk) are all scored as zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are identified in the code logic or reasoning.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score (0):** No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The only potential concern could be if the response object stored in exceptions were mishandled elsewhere, but in this code, it is merely stored, not processed or executed.\n- The code is purely structural, designed for error handling, with no evident attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the code is benign and well-structured for its purpose.** The scores assigned in the reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, secure implementation of custom exception classes for an OAuth library, with no malicious or security issues detected.",
