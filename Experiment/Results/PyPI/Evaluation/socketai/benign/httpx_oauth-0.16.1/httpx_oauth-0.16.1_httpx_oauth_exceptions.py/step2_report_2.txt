  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception.\n- Exception classes store error messages and optionally include an httpx.Response object.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only stores parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, benign error handling utility for an OAuth library.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly identifies that the code is purely structural for error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0. Confirmed appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Accurate assessment of the code's benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0. Confirmed.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correctly notes that storing response objects does not introduce security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0. Confirmed.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Properly states that exception classes are standard and do not process untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0. Confirmed.\n- **Conclusion:** No vulnerabilities.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Appropriately identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0. Confirmed.\n- **Conclusion:** No risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes used for error handling in an OAuth client library. It does not process untrusted data insecurely, does not contain obfuscation, nor does it exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no security issues. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
