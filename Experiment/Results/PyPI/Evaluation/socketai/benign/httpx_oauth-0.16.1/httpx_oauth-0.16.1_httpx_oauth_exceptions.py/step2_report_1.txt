  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for handling errors in an OAuth-related Python library.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external data handling, or network activity.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The exception classes store error messages and optionally include an HTTP response object for context, which is standard practice.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1 & 2 & 4 & 5:**\n- Confirmed that the code matches the description: class definitions inheriting from Exception, with message and response attributes.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or data leaks.\n- The reasoning that the code is benign and purely structural is sound.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which seems appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Notes that response objects are stored as attributes but not used insecurely.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The reasoning aligns with the others, and the confidence is 1.0, which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond class definitions, so there's no attack surface.\n- The only possible concern might be if the response objects stored could be used maliciously, but since they are just stored as attributes without further processing, this is not a security risk.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- Malware score: all reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk: 0, no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final assessment:** The code is purely structural, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.",
