  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the httpx-oauth library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines exception classes and their initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; exceptions are used internally.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception. The exceptions are designed to carry error messages and optional HTTP response objects. There are no user inputs, external data reading, or suspicious constructs such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The code appears to be standard error handling for a Python OAuth library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in an OAuth context. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security risks present. It is a benign utility module.",
