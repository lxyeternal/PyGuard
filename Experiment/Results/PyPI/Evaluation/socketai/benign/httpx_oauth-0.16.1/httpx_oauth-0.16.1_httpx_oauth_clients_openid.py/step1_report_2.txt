{
  "purpose": "Implement an OpenID Connect client that discovers provider endpoints automatically and fetches user profile information.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from an external URL; reads tokens for profile fetching; reads profile data for email and subject.",
  "sinks": "Uses tokens in Authorization headers for profile requests; raises exceptions with response data; parses JSON responses.",
  "flows": "Fetches OpenID configuration -> Uses endpoints for token and user info -> Retrieves user profile data -> Extracts user ID and email.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network calls or backdoors; uses standard library features and common OAuth2 flows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OpenID discovery and user profile retrieval with proper error handling. It does not contain any hidden or malicious code. There are no suspicious network operations outside typical OAuth2 procedures. No data leaks, credential theft, or unauthorized system access mechanisms are present. The use of external URLs and JSON processing appears safe and consistent with OpenID specifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an OpenID client without malicious intent. It securely fetches configuration, handles errors properly, and retrieves user profile data in a standard manner. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
