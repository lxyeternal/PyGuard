{
  "purpose": "A standard OpenID Connect client that performs configuration discovery, token management, and user profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to the openid_configuration_endpoint during initialization; profile data fetched via async GET request using the access token.",
  "sinks": "The profile retrieval endpoint ('userinfo_endpoint') which outputs user profile data; the configuration fetch endpoint which retrieves configuration data.",
  "flows": "Configuration endpoint response flows into setting various endpoint URLs and supported methods; profile endpoint response flows into returning user info; exceptions can propagate from network errors.",
  "anomalies": "Synchronous HTTP request within an async class constructor, which could cause blocking in an async context; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OpenID configuration discovery and user info retrieval using httpx. It handles errors appropriately and does not contain malicious patterns or obfuscation. The synchronous request during object initialization is a minor design concern but not malicious. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an OpenID client with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, primarily due to the synchronous request pattern which could be optimized but does not pose a security threat.",
