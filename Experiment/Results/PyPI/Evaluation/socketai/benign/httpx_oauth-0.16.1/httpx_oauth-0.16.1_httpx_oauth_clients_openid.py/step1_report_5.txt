{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OpenID Connect client to interact with OAuth2 providers, fetching configuration and user profile data.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to the openid_configuration_endpoint, HTTP GET request to the userinfo_endpoint, reading response JSON, reading response status code.",
  "sinks": "Response handling in get_profile and get_id_email functions, especially the return of profile data and errors; exception raising on HTTP errors.",
  "flows": "Fetching OpenID configuration from the provided URL, then using endpoints from the configuration to fetch user info, returning sub and email from profile.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data present. No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. Proper exception handling for HTTP errors is present. Usage of standard library and third-party dependencies appears typical. No dynamic code execution or suspicious URL handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches and processes OpenID configuration data, then uses standard HTTP requests to retrieve user profile information. It handles exceptions appropriately, converting HTTP errors into custom exceptions. The use of get_args for supported auth methods is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns identified. The logic is straightforward, focusing on OpenID interactions with no external or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an OpenID client for authentication purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious activity or suspicious patterns, and the security measures seem appropriate for its intended function.",
