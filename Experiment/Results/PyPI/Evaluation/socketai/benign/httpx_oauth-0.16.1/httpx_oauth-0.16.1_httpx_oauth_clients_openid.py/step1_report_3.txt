  "purpose": "A client implementation for OpenID Connect authentication, handling discovery, token endpoint configuration, and profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to openid_configuration_endpoint, profile endpoint, and environment variables for credentials (implied).",
  "sinks": "Use of tokens in Authorization headers, JSON response processing, and potential exceptions raising.",
  "flows": "Fetching OpenID configuration → determining endpoints → requesting userinfo with access token → returning profile data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network addresses. Standard use of HTTPX for network communication.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OpenID Connect discovery and profile fetching. It securely fetches configuration data and endpoints, then uses tokens to retrieve user info. Error handling is implemented properly. No signs of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity. No backdoors or hidden malicious code are present. Usage of standard libraries and practices appear benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical OpenID client implementation with proper error handling and configuration management. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this code snippet.",
