{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OpenID client for OAuth2 authentication, fetching configuration from a discovery endpoint, and retrieving user profile data including email.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to openid_configuration_endpoint, HTTP GET request to userinfo_endpoint, JSON responses from these requests, and input parameters such as client_id, client_secret, and token.",
  "sinks": "Response to get_profile method (HTTP request), JSON parsing, raising exceptions for HTTP errors, returning user ID and email.",
  "flows": "Configuration endpoint URL (input) -> fetch and parse OpenID configuration (data flow) -> fetch user info with token (input) -> parse and return user info (output).",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or secrets; it performs standard OAuth2/OpenID flow. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No evidence of data exfiltration or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an OpenID Connect client. It securely fetches configuration, supports dynamic endpoint discovery, and retrieves user profile information. Error handling is appropriately implemented to raise specific exceptions. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as hidden network activity, backdoors, or credential leaks. Usage of external HTTPX library and proper exception handling suggest a typical, secure implementation. No signs of code injection, insecure data handling, or malicious activity were observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard OpenID client implementation with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs necessary operations for OAuth2/OpenID flows securely. Overall, the code shows no signs of sabotage or malware.",
