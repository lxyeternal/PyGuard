  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, static setup.py configuration for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code, network operations, data handling, or user input is involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code only specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package structure.\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n\n- Confirmed: The code is purely declarative, with no executable logic outside the setup() call.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the script is a standard package setup with no security risks.\n\n**Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?**\n\n- The scores seem consistent and justified based on the content.\n\n**Potential overestimations:**\n\n- No overestimations detected; all assessments are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py for packaging a Python project.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks involved)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no adjustments needed.",
