  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package (`httpx-oauth`).\n- It only defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, author info, and package list.\n- There are no code execution, network operations, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code strictly adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n**Matching reports to the code:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The malware score in all reports is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, correctly reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which is reasonable.\n\n**Critical points:**\n\n- The code does not perform any runtime actions, network communication, or data handling beyond static configuration.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious logic.\n- The dependency version (`httpx>=0.18`) is relatively broad but still within a safe range, and no security issues are implied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the code is a typical, safe `setup.py` script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**This aligns with all reports and the code content.**",
