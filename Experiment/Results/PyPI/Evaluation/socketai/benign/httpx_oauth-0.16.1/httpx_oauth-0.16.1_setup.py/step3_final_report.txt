  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging the 'httpx-oauth' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependency declarations, author info, classifiers, and package list within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not perform any runtime data input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows or external data processing; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup configuration using setuptools. It contains no executable logic beyond package metadata declaration. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup file with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
