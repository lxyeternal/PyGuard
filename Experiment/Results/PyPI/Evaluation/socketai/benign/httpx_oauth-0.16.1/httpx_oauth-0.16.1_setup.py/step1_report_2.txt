{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'httpx-oauth' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, dependencies, and package structure; no external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as the code only involves package setup routines; it does not perform data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely specifies static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses standard setuptools patterns for package setup. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls the setup() function with static parameters defining the package name, version, description, long description, author info, classifiers, dependencies, and package list. All data appears to be static, descriptive, and related to package distribution. No dynamic code execution, input parsing, or network communication occurs. The package metadata is typical and contains no suspicious patterns. Overall, this is a standard setup script with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup configuration code is benign, standard for Python package distribution, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
