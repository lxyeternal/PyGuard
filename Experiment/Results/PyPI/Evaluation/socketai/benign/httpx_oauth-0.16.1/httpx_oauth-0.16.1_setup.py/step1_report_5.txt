  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'httpx-oauth', which is intended to facilitate OAuth authentication using HTTPX.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from static strings, package metadata fields, and dependency specifications; no external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "The script does not contain any runtime data sinks; it only defines package metadata and dependencies, with no execution of untrusted data or network connections.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the script is solely for package configuration and installation; no dynamic data processing or execution flow involving untrusted data exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The script strictly adheres to standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It includes package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and package lists. No code execution, user input handling, or data processing is present. All elements appear standard for package distribution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected. The structure and content are typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution purposes.",
