  "purpose": "Defines a Protocol interface for branding information, specifying display_name and logo_svg attributes.",
  "sources": "No input sources; purely a type hint interface definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares a Protocol.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for type hinting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Protocol from typing and declares a class BrandingProtocol that specifies two string attributes. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated elements, and no suspicious logic or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple type declaration for a Protocol interface with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard and safe.",
