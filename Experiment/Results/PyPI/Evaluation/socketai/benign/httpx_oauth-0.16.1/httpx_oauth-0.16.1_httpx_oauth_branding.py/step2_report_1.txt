  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward Python Protocol class defining two string attributes: `display_name` and `logo_svg`.\n   - It imports `Protocol` from `typing` and declares an interface for type hinting.\n   - There are no data processing, input/output, dynamic code execution, or external interactions.\n   - The code does not contain any secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or suspicious activity.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n   - The code is purely a static type hinting interface, which is safe and standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0, since the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No report suggests any vulnerability or suspicious behavior that warrants a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a benign, standard type hinting interface.\n   - No modifications or increased scores are necessary.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a simple, safe, and standard Python Protocol interface declaration with no security concerns. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. No changes to the scores are needed.",
