  "purpose": "Define a Python Protocol interface with two string attributes for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code imports 'Protocol' from 'typing' and defines class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code contains only static attribute declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Protocol class with two string attributes, used for type hinting. It contains no dynamic code, external interactions, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely for interface declaration, which is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python Protocol interface with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
