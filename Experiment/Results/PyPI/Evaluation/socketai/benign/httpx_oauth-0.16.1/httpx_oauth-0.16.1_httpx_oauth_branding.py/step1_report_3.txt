  "purpose": "Define a protocol interface for branding information including display name and logo in a type-safe manner.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only declares a protocol with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only declares a protocol structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for type hinting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'Protocol' class from the 'typing' module and declares a protocol with two string attributes: 'display_name' and 'logo_svg'. This is a typical pattern for defining interface-like behavior in Python, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or external input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a simple type hinting construct for structured branding information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type hinting definition for a branding protocol. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
