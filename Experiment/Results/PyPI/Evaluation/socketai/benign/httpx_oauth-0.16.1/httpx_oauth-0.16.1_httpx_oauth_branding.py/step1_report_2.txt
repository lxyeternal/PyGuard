  "purpose": "Define a protocol for branding information with display name and logo SVG",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a class protocol definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output, no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink, as the code only declares a protocol interface.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of a Protocol class with two string attributes. It uses Python's typing.Protocol to specify an interface, which is standard practice and does not involve any dynamic code execution, data handling, or potential entry points for malicious activity. No external data sources, no sinks, and no flows are present. The code appears to serve as a type hinting interface without any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple protocol declaration for branding attributes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
