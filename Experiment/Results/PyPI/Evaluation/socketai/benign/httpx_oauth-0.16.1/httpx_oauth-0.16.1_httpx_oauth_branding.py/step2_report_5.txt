  "review": "Let's review the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `Protocol` from `typing`.\n- Declares a class `BrandingProtocol` that specifies two string attributes: `display_name` and `logo_svg`.\n- The code is purely a type hinting interface, with no runtime logic, data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that this is a straightforward Protocol declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Analysis correctness:** All reports correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and contains no anomalies or security concerns.\n- **Potential errors:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are present in the reports' reasoning.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct since there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Security risk:** All are 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all recognize the code as a simple interface declaration.\n- The scores are reasonable and reflect the actual risk profile.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard Python Protocol interface declaration with no runtime behavior, no external data handling, and no malicious intent.  \n- There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.  \n- The purpose is purely for type hinting and interface enforcement, which is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code is benign, with no security risks or malware concerns. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores as-is: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- No further action needed.",
