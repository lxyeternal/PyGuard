{
  "purpose": "This code implements a generic OAuth2 client for handling authorization flows, token management, and API interactions in Python.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL parameters for authorization URL, token request data (authorization code, refresh tokens), and HTTP responses from OAuth2 endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests to OAuth2 endpoints, JSON responses, and request headers. Data is sent to external services via HTTP requests, and JSON is parsed from responses.",
  "flows": "Source: user input (authorization code, refresh token) → build HTTP request → send request to OAuth2 endpoints → receive and process JSON responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no use of unsafe eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The code strictly performs OAuth2 flow logic. No suspicious or unusual code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for OAuth2 error handling, token management, and a base OAuth2 client. It performs standard OAuth2 operations such as obtaining authorization URLs, requesting access tokens, refreshing tokens, and revoking tokens via HTTP requests. All sensitive data (client ID, secret) are passed as parameters, not hardcoded. The network requests use standard libraries, with proper error handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are observed. The code is structured, readable, and aligns with typical OAuth2 client implementations, with no obfuscated parts or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an OAuth2 client library with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It handles OAuth2 flows securely without hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. The overall security risk is low.",
