  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard OAuth2 client handling URL generation, token exchange, refresh, revocation, and user profile retrieval. The data flows from input parameters through network requests and responses.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes that the code is legitimate with high confidence (0.95), no obfuscation, and no malware (score 0). The security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code content. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard OAuth2 flows, with input data flowing into network requests and responses.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The code follows standard practices, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscation 0, low security risk (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The analysis correctly notes the code's standard OAuth2 operations, with input parameters flowing into network requests and responses.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and practices.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0), malware score 0, obfuscation 0, no security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The description matches the code's behavior—handling OAuth2 flows with proper request and response management.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard and secure.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscation 0, minimal security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct assessment; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The analysis aligns with the code's standard OAuth2 flow handling.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and secure.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscation 0, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's content. The code is a standard OAuth2 client library, with no malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** They are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code, which handles tokens and network requests securely.\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, inherent to network-based OAuth2 flows, but no vulnerabilities or malicious risks identified.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard, well-structured OAuth2 client implementation. No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and reflect the code's benign nature. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the code review. No adjustments needed.",
