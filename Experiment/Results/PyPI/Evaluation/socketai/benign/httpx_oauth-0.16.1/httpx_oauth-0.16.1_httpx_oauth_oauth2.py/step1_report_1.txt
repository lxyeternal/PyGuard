{
  "purpose": "The code provides a base implementation for an OAuth2 client, handling authorization URL construction, token exchange, refresh, revocation, and user profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters such as authorization codes, refresh tokens, tokens for revocation, and user tokens.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests to token and revocation endpoints, and JSON responses from API calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as authorization codes and tokens flow into network requests (sinks) for token exchange, refresh, or revocation; responses are processed for tokens or user data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code properly handles exceptions and uses standard libraries for HTTP requests and JSON processing. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard OAuth2 client implementation with methods to generate authorization URLs, handle token requests, refresh tokens, revoke tokens, and fetch user profiles. It uses secure practices like raising exceptions on HTTP errors and parsing JSON responses carefully. No malicious intent or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden network activity are detected. The code does not contain suspicious or obfuscated sections; it adheres to typical OAuth2 client patterns. External library usage is standard and justified for HTTP requests. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate and standard OAuth2 client without any signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard OAuth2 client implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs typical OAuth2 flows securely and correctly, with appropriate exception handling. No evidence of malware or security risks found.",
