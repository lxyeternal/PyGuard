  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard OAuth2 client, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. It handles token exchange, refresh, revocation, and profile retrieval securely and correctly.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The low security risk score aligns with the code's straightforward implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard OAuth2 client with no malicious behaviors, proper request handling, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious elements or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary. The report aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard OAuth2 client with correct request handling, no secrets hardcoded, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues identified.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: a legitimate OAuth2 client, no signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The report matches the code's characteristics.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with the previous reports—standard OAuth2 client, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's function and lack of vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, reflecting the clear, standard implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the comprehensive review, **the scores are reasonable and consistent** with the code. The code is a straightforward, standard OAuth2 client implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard OAuth2 client)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
