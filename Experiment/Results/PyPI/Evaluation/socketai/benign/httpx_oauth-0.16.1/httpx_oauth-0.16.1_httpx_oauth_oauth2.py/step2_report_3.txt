  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the OAuth2 client functions—authorization URL, token exchange, refresh, revoke, profile retrieval.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation observed.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is a standard OAuth2 client with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (consistent with no malicious activity)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (low, due to network interactions and token handling, but nothing risky)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identifies that input data flows into network requests, which is standard.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Validates that the code is a typical OAuth2 client, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, given the network activity and token handling)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the OAuth2 client functions and data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is a legitimate OAuth2 client without malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0 (no evident security concern)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the standard OAuth2 flow and data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is a secure OAuth2 client, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the OAuth2 client operations.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard OAuth2 client with low security risk.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, given network interactions)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, reflecting normal network activity and token handling, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final System-Wide Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.1-0.2 — low, due to network interactions inherent in OAuth2 flows.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — consistent with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score reflects the normal operation of an OAuth2 client handling network requests and tokens securely.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
