  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard OAuth2 client, handling URL creation, token exchange, refresh, revocation, and profile retrieval. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The confidence is high (0.95), and malware/obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic. It uses standard libraries and patterns. No network anomalies or suspicious data flows are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with my review. The risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard OAuth2 flows, safe handling of tokens, and network requests. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence is 0.9; malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs expected OAuth2 client operations with proper exception handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent. The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering the code's standard nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard OAuth2 client with proper request handling, token management, and error handling. No malicious or suspicious code patterns. Confidence is 1; malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code adheres to best practices. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified. The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—standard OAuth2 client, secure token handling, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard libraries used. Confidence is 0.9; malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns well. Security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard OAuth2 client with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Confidence 0.9; malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware or security issues.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate zero, and I concur. The code is a legitimate OAuth2 client implementation, with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate zero, which is consistent. The code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the analysis, the overall security risk is very low. The minimal scores (mostly 0 or 0.2) are appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- It performs standard OAuth2 flows securely.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- Network interactions are standard, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious activity.\n- Exception handling and request management follow best practices.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, considering the code's benign nature)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, secure OAuth2 client implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
