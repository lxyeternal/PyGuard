{
  "purpose": "This code implements a standard OAuth2 client handling authorization URL generation, token exchange, refresh, revocation, and profile retrieval, following typical OAuth2 flows.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as authorization code, redirect URI, refresh token, and token to revoke; network requests to OAuth2 endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network responses containing tokens, user profile data, or error messages.",
  "flows": "Input data (authorization code, refresh token, token to revoke) flows into network requests; responses are parsed into OAuth2Token objects or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and practices for OAuth2 operations, with proper exception handling and input validation. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure is clear, and the logic aligns with typical OAuth2 client implementations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OAuth2 client library with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It handles tokens securely and follows best practices. The overall security risk is minimal.",
