{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package that performs some functionality, possibly related to data processing or utility functions, based on the structure and imports.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, configuration files, and user input via function parameters or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or system commands, which could lead to data exfiltration or system compromise if untrusted data is used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through processing functions, and then potentially to sinks like network calls, file I/O, or subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code patterns are detected. The code does not perform any obviously malicious operations. The structure is typical for a utility library.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard imports and contains functions with clearly defined purposes. It reads data from environment variables or parameters and writes or transmits data through controlled channels. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The absence of suspicious network activity or system modifications suggests normal behavior. Without hidden or obfuscated code, the risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious intent or suspicious behavior based on the provided content. It seems to be a standard utility module with no evident security risks. No malware or malicious data flows are detected.",
