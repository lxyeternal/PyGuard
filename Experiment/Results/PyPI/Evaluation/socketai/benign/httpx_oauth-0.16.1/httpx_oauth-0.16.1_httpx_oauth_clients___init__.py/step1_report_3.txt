  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but the actual purpose cannot be definitively determined without analyzing the specific implementation details.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables, function parameters, or external files (if any). Exact sources are unclear due to the absence of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or data serialization points. Specific sinks cannot be identified without actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various functions or methods. Without concrete code, this flow cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident from the description. The code content is not provided, limiting detailed anomaly detection.",
  "analysis": "Due to the lack of the actual code content, this review cannot definitively identify malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious functions are observed from the provided description. However, the absence of concrete code prevents a thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information and lack of specific code details, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more detailed review of the actual source code is necessary to confirm.",
