  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network activity, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, environment variables, system calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) potentially flow into network calls, dynamic code execution, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), suspicious network activity, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded URLs/IPs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1, 2, 3, and 5, with no suspicious constructs or malicious payloads. Report 4 indicates dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscated strings, and network activity, which are classic indicators of obfuscation and potential malicious intent. The confidence scores reflect the certainty based on available information. The high malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.7) scores in report 4 are justified by these indicators, while the other reports' scores are appropriate given their benign descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports describe benign code with low security risk and no malware. Report 4 shows clear signs of obfuscation and malicious behavior, warranting higher scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analysis, with report 4 being the outlier indicating potential malicious activity.",
