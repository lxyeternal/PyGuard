  "conclusion": "Most reports describe benign code with low security risk and no malware. Report 4 shows clear signs of obfuscation and malicious behavior, warranting higher scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analysis, with report 4 being the outlier indicating potential malicious activity."
