  "purpose": "OAuth2 client for Reddit, handling authorization, token exchange, profile retrieval, and email extraction.",
  "sources": "Network requests to Reddit API endpoints, reading configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Response handling, raising exceptions on errors, returning profile data.",
  "flows": "Authorization code received -> get_access_token -> get_profile -> get_id_email.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; static SVG logo benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 client with proper error handling and external dependency usage. No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. Network interactions are typical API calls. The structure and logic follow best practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of a Reddit OAuth2 client. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The low security risk score (around 0.1) and zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
