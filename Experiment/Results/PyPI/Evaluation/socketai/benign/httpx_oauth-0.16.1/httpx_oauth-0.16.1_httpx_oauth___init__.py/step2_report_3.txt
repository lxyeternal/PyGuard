  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze an extremely minimal code snippet: only a docstring and a version string.\n- No functions, classes, input/output operations, or external interactions are present.\n- The reports consistently conclude that there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk based on this limited fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code snippet contains only a module docstring and a version declaration. There are no executable statements, data flows, or suspicious constructs.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical reasoning:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the minimal nature of the code and appropriately conclude that no security issues are evident.  \n- **Potential oversight:**  \n  Since the code snippet is only a header, the reports cannot assess the actual implementation of the OAuth client. They are correct in limiting their analysis to this fragment.  \n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. The securityRisk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, which is reasonable given the code is straightforward and minimal.  \n- **Malware:** All are 0, justified by the lack of suspicious or malicious content.  \n- **SecurityRisk:** All are 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nNo score adjustments are necessary based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely a header with no executable logic, the risk scores should remain very low or zero.  \n- The reports' assessments are consistent with this.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.  \n- No malicious activity or indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports avoid speculative claims, correctly noting the minimal and benign nature of the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the content and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final critical assessment:\n- **Overall, the reports are accurate and cautious, correctly identifying that the snippet is benign.**  \n- **Given the extremely limited code, there's no basis for higher risk or malware scores.**  \n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is just a module header with a version string and no executable or suspicious content. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are detectable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The minimal code snippet justifies a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and overall security risk of 0. No further action or concern is warranted based on this fragment.",
