  "purpose": "OAuth2 client for Naver, handling token revocation and profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (not explicitly shown), network requests to external endpoints, response data from API calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to revoke tokens and get profile data; parsing JSON responses from external APIs.",
  "flows": "Authorization token used in profile retrieval, token passed for revocation, responses parsed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; standard OAuth2 flow; no obfuscated code detected; SVG logo embedded but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 client for Naver with methods for token revocation and profile retrieval. It uses network requests with proper headers, handles exceptions explicitly, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network communications are evident. The token revocation and profile fetch are straightforward API interactions. The code structure and variable names are clear and typical for OAuth2 implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an OAuth2 client for Naver with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard API interactions and exception handling without suspicious patterns.",
