  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the validity of the claims, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether the code contains any malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- Implements an OAuth2 client for Naver.\n- Handles token revocation and profile retrieval.\n- Uses standard endpoints and HTTP requests.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No obfuscated code.\n- No suspicious URLs or data.\n- Error handling appears appropriate.\n- The only unusual aspect is the use of `'grant_type': 'delete'` for token revocation, which is somewhat unconventional but not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues and Logical Consistency\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  The code appears correct and aligns with typical OAuth2 client implementations. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are evident.  \n  **Verdict:** No issues are present.\n\n- **Error in the report's reasoning:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent. They note the unusual `'grant_type': 'delete'` but acknowledge it might be valid.  \n  **Verdict:** No logical flaws or mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of **0**.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity: no data exfiltration, no backdoors, no code injection, no suspicious network activity beyond standard OAuth2 flows.\n- The only potential concern is the `'grant_type': 'delete'` in `revoke_token`. However, this is a documented OAuth2 revocation method in some implementations, not malware.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score should remain at 0.**\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0.\n- The code is clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- The embedded SVG is harmless.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Obfuscated score should remain at 0.**\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- Reports assign 0.1 or 0.2, citing minimal risk, mainly related to token handling.\n- The code handles tokens securely, with no hardcoded secrets.\n- The only questionable point is the `'grant_type': 'delete'`, but it's a documented method for token revocation, not malicious.\n\n**Justification for a score > 0.5:**  \nGiven the standard nature of the code and the lack of malicious activity, a score higher than 0.2 is unwarranted. The minimal risk is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Security risk score should be around 0.1–0.2, consistent with current reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities and Assumptions\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming secrets are hardcoded; they note external configuration management.\n- No suspicious URL endpoints beyond standard OAuth endpoints.\n- No code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nNo vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (most reports agree)\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard OAuth2 client with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n| Score Type          | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware             | 0                   | No malicious activity detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated          | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Security Risk       | 0.1–0.2             | Minimal risk; standard OAuth2 implementation; no secrets hardcoded. |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe unusual `'grant_type': 'delete'` in `revoke_token` is not inherently malicious but should be verified against Naver's OAuth2 documentation. If confirmed as valid, it does not impact security or malware assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
