  "purpose": "OAuth2 client implementation for Naver authentication, including token revocation and profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "Configuration constants, class methods that make HTTP requests, token and profile data processing.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to token revocation and profile endpoints; processing of response data.",
  "flows": "Token and profile data are retrieved via HTTP POST, then processed and returned; error handling wraps profile retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns. The revoke_token method uses 'grant_type':'delete', which is uncommon but may be valid for this provider; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for OAuth2 interactions with Naver, including token revocation and profile fetching. It uses standard patterns for HTTP requests and error handling. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The revoke_token method's use of 'grant_type':'delete' is unusual but aligns with some OAuth revocation practices. No suspicious data leaks, code injection points, or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical OAuth2 client implementation for Naver with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It performs authorized API calls and handles errors appropriately. There are no signs of sabotage or malware within this code segment.",
