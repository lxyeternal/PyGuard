  "purpose": "OAuth2 client for Naver, handling authorization, token revocation, and profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to OAuth endpoints, token parameter inputs, response JSON parsing.",
  "sinks": "Authorization headers, request data for token revocation and profile fetching.",
  "flows": "Tokens are sent in headers and data; responses parsed for profile info; token revoked via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'grant_type':'delete' in revoke_token(), which is unconventional but documented in some OAuth implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward OAuth2 client with standard endpoints and error handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The only unusual aspect is the 'grant_type':'delete' in revoke_token(), which may be provider-specific. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code structure and logic are clear and align with typical OAuth2 patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OAuth2 client for Naver, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of 'grant_type':'delete' is unconventional but not malicious; it should be verified against provider documentation. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
