{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OAuth2 client for Naver, enabling authentication and profile retrieval via Naver's API.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the token parameter passed to get_profile and get_id_email methods; it also reads configuration data during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code sends HTTP POST requests to PROFILE_ENDPOINT and revoke_token_endpoint, and processes responses; it also constructs request headers with potential tokens.",
  "flows": "Token is used in get_profile to fetch user profile data, then the profile data is used in get_id_email to extract 'id' and 'email'. The revoke_token method sends token revocation requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious URLs or data. The only endpoint URLs are standard OAuth endpoints; no unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an OAuth2 client class for Naver with methods to revoke tokens and retrieve user profiles. It uses standard HTTP requests, proper error handling, and safe data access. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, is evident. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with typical OAuth2 client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an OAuth2 client for Naver, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles tokens and user data responsibly, with proper error handling and standard practices.",
