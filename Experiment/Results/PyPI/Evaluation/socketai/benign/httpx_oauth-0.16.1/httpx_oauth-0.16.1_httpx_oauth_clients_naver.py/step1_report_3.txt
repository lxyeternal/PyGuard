  "purpose": "OAuth2 client implementation for Naver, handling token revocation and profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input data includes tokens passed to revoke_token, get_profile, and get_id_email methods; configuration data such as client_id and client_secret used during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Tokens used in revoke_token and get_profile methods; HTTP request sending via get_httpx_client and build_request; response handling with response.json()",
  "flows": "Tokens and profile data flow from method parameters into HTTP requests; responses processed to extract user profile info and email.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; the revoke_token uses a 'grant_type' of 'delete', which is unusual but not necessarily malicious; no hidden backdoors or suspicious data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward OAuth2 client for Naver, utilizing standard endpoints and libraries. It properly manages HTTP requests, token revocation, and profile retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling was found. The 'grant_type' of 'delete' for revoking tokens is somewhat unconventional but documented in some OAuth implementations. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic detected. The code focuses on standard OAuth2 procedures without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of an OAuth2 client for Naver, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles tokens securely and performs expected API interactions. No malicious or security-threatening actions are evident.",
