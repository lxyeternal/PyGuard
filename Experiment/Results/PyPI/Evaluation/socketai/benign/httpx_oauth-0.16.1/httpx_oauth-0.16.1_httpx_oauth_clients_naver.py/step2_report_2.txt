  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an OAuth2 client for Naver, using token input and configuration data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; tokens are used in API requests, responses parsed.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious URLs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (minimal). These seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the straightforward, standard OAuth2 client implementation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes token usage and profile data extraction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; tokens sent in headers, profile info parsed.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, only standard OAuth endpoints.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Validates the code as standard, with tokens exposed only in OAuth workflows, which is normal.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Slightly higher due to token handling but still low.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just standard token handling.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes token revocation and profile retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; tokens used in HTTP requests.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the use of `'grant_type':'delete'` for revocation, which is somewhat unconventional but documented.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard with a minor unusual aspect but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Reasonable given the unconventional `'grant_type'`, but not malicious.\n- **Justification:** No malware, just an uncommon revocation method.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the flow.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard OAuth2 pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard implementation, minimal risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes `'grant_type':'delete'` again, which is unusual but documented.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward OAuth2 client nature. No malicious code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern—mainly standard token handling and API interactions.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, standard OAuth2 client implementation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. The only noteworthy point is the use of `'grant_type':'delete'` for revocation, which is unconventional but not malicious. No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with a very low risk and no malware concern.",
