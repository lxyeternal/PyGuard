  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OAuth2 client for Naver, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of 'grant_type':'delete' is unconventional but not malicious; it should be verified against provider documentation. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero."
