  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard OAuth2 client for Naver, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The only unusual aspect noted is the use of `\"grant_type\": \"delete\"` in `revoke_token()`, which is somewhat unconventional but not necessarily malicious or suspicious.\n- The code appears to follow standard OAuth2 patterns, with proper error handling and request construction.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code issues:\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. The only potential concern is the `\"grant_type\": \"delete\"` in `revoke_token()`. This is not a standard OAuth2 grant type; typically, token revocation is performed via a specific endpoint or method, not by setting `grant_type` to `\"delete\"`.  \n  **However**, the code uses `revoke_token_endpoint` and the `build_request()` method, which likely supports custom parameters. If the provider expects `\"grant_type\": \"delete\"` for revocation, this is acceptable. If not, it could be a logical flaw or misconfiguration.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The use of `\"grant_type\": \"delete\"` in `revoke_token()` is **unusual**. Standard OAuth2 revocation usually involves POSTing to a revocation endpoint with `token` and `token_type_hint`.  \n- **Potential mistake:** If the OAuth provider expects a specific revocation request (e.g., POST with `token` parameter), then setting `grant_type` to `\"delete\"` may be invalid.  \n- **Recommendation:** Verify with Naver's OAuth documentation whether `\"grant_type\": \"delete\"` is valid. If not, this is a logical mistake that could cause revocation to fail.\n\n---\n\n### Scores justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code does not perform any malicious activity.  \n  **This is justified.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. No obfuscation is present.  \n  **This is justified.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0.1` or `0.2`. Given the lack of secrets and malicious activity, the risk is minimal.  \n  **However,** the only concern is the unconventional `grant_type` in revocation, which could lead to failed revocation or unexpected behavior if the API does not support it.  \n  **Therefore,** a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.2) might be justified if this is a misconfiguration, but overall, the risk remains low.\n\n### Overall risk assessment:\n- The overall security risk is low, assuming correct API behavior.  \n- The key point is verifying the `grant_type` in `revoke_token()`.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Clarify the `grant_type` used in token revocation:**  \n  Check Naver's OAuth documentation to confirm whether `\"grant_type\": \"delete\"` is valid. If not, replace it with the standard approach (e.g., POST with `token` parameter).  \n- **Scores adjustment:**  \n  Given the above, I would suggest:\n  - Malware: **0** (no malicious code)\n  - Obfuscated: **0** (not obfuscated)\n  - Risk: **0.2** (due to the unconventional revoke request, but not necessarily a vulnerability)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**The code is a standard OAuth2 client with no malicious intent.**  \nThe only potential issue is the revocation method's `grant_type`. If this is non-standard or unsupported, it could cause functional problems but not security risks per se.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the unconventional revoke request, which should be verified against provider docs)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears legitimate and safe, with a minor potential logical flaw in the revocation request that should be validated. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
