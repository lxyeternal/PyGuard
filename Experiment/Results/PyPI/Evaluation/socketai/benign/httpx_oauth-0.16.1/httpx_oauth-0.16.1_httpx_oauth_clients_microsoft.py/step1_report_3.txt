  "purpose": "OAuth2 client implementation for Microsoft Graph API to authenticate and retrieve user profile information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters such as 'token' in 'get_profile' and 'get_id_email'. It also constructs URLs using format strings with 'tenant'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data is sent in HTTP request headers for API calls. The token is used to access profile data via external API.",
  "flows": "Token input flows into 'get_profile' which makes an HTTP GET request; the profile data is then processed in 'get_id_email' to extract user ID and email.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The URL templates are constructed dynamically with 'tenant', but this is standard for OAuth2 flows. No unusual code structures or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of OAuth2 flow with Microsoft Graph API. It securely constructs URLs using provided parameters, makes HTTP requests with proper authorization headers, and handles exceptions properly. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only data flow involves legitimate API interaction, and no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It follows typical patterns for OAuth2 integrations.",
