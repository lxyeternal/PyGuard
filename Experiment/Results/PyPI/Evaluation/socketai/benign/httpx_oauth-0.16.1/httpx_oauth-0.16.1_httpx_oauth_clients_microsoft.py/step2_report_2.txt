  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- Implements a standard OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API.\n- Uses URL templates with tenant IDs, dynamic URL formatting.\n- Retrieves user profile info via HTTP GET with Bearer token.\n- Handles errors with custom exceptions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Contains a static SVG logo, which is harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code.\n- The token is used in API requests, which is standard.\n- The exception handling appears correct.\n- The SVG logo is static and not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate OAuth2 client with no security issues or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- *Purpose & flow:* Accurate.\n- *Anomalies:* None suspicious.\n- *Analysis & conclusion:* Correct, well-structured, no malicious behavior.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n  **This seems reasonable.**  \n- **Note:** The securityRisk is low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- *Purpose & flow:* Accurate.\n- *Anomalies:* None suspicious.\n- *Analysis & conclusion:* Correct, standard practices.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n  **Reasonable.**  \n- **Note:** Slightly higher securityRisk, but still low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- *Purpose & flow:* Accurate.\n- *Anomalies:* None suspicious.\n- *Analysis & conclusion:* Correct.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n  **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- *Purpose & flow:* Accurate.\n- *Anomalies:* None suspicious.\n- *Analysis & conclusion:* Correct.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n  **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- *Purpose & flow:* Accurate.\n- *Anomalies:* None suspicious.\n- *Analysis & conclusion:* Correct.\n- *Scores:* malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0.  \n  **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n### Risk Scores:\n- The securityRisk scores are all very low, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n- The highest is 0.2, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** around 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since the code handles tokens securely, uses standard practices, and contains no suspicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent with the code. No suspicious activity, malware, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are or slightly adjust the risk to 0.1 for a conservative but accurate reflection of the minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate an official summary or any further analysis?**",
