  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements an OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API.\n- Uses standard endpoints, URL formatting, and exception handling.\n- Retrieves user profile data using a provided token.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- Contains a static SVG logo unrelated to security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code appears free of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The token is used securely in HTTP headers.\n- Exception handling is appropriate.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No significant flaws are evident.\n- The only minor point: the `scopes` default to `BASE_SCOPES`, which is acceptable, but could be explicitly set during instantiation for clarity. This isn't a security flaw, just a suggestion for clarity.\n\n### Review of the report scores:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Malware:** 0 → Correct, no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 → Correct.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 → Reasonable, given the code is standard OAuth2 client with minimal risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above.\n\n**Overall:** All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The risk scores are low but acknowledge minimal inherent security risk in OAuth2 implementations.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code is a typical OAuth2 client; the only risk is if tokens are mishandled elsewhere or if the implementation is insecure in deployment.\n- Since the code itself does not contain secrets or malicious behaviors, a risk score of around **0.1 to 0.2** is appropriate.\n- The malware score is correctly set to **0** in all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as **0** in all reports, which is justified.\n\n### Obfuscated:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports and the code's nature)\n\n---\n\n### Critical notes:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware are justified here.\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API.\n- The static SVG logo is benign.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the code's standard, secure implementation with minimal inherent risk.",
