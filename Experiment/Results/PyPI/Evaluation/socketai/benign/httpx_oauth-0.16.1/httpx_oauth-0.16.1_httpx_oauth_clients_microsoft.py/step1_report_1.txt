{
  "purpose": "This code implements an OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API, allowing authentication and profile retrieval from Microsoft services.",
  "sources": "Reading input data includes the 'token' parameter passed to get_profile and get_id_email methods, and configuration parameters such as client_id, client_secret, tenant, and scopes during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data (the token) is used in HTTP GET request headers to fetch user profile data from Microsoft Graph API.",
  "flows": "The token is passed from external sources to get_profile, which fetches user data, and then get_id_email extracts 'id' and 'userPrincipalName' from the profile response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious or unnecessary dynamic code execution or obfuscation is observed. The code uses standard library and known third-party libraries with proper exception handling. The SVG logo is static and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an OAuth2 client class with methods to generate authorization URLs and retrieve user profile information using an access token. It uses proper exception handling and avoids insecure practices. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The only data flow involves standard API requests with bearer tokens, typical for OAuth2 clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and designed for standard OAuth2 authentication with Microsoft Graph API. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. The code is well-structured and follows best practices, with no signs of security risks or malware.",
