{
  "purpose": "OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API, used to authenticate users and retrieve profile information.",
  "sources": "Reads the OAuth2 token for authorization in get_profile and get_id_email methods; reads profile data from the response.",
  "sinks": "Returns profile data including 'id' and 'userPrincipalName'; raises exceptions on error responses.",
  "flows": "Uses token to fetch profile info from Microsoft Graph API endpoint; processes response to extract user ID and email.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; standard API endpoint formatting; no suspicious external calls or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 flow with well-defined API endpoints and error handling. It uses HTTP headers for authorization and handles errors gracefully by raising specific exceptions. The profile fetching and parsing are straightforward, with no signs of malicious payloads or hidden behaviors. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, and the code does not perform any unsafe operations or external data exfiltration. The SVG logo is benign and unrelated to security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
