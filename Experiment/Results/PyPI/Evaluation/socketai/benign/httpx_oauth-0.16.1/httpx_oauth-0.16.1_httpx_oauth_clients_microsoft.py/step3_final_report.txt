  "purpose": "OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API, handling authorization and profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "Token passed in headers for API requests; URL templates for endpoints; static SVG logo.",
  "sinks": "API responses containing user profile data; exceptions raised on errors.",
  "flows": "Token obtained via OAuth2 flow, used in get_profile to fetch user data, which is then parsed for ID and email.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; static SVG logo is harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API. It constructs URLs dynamically based on tenant, handles tokens securely, and manages exceptions properly. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The static SVG logo is benign. The flow of token usage and profile retrieval follows standard practices. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified. The security risk is minimal, primarily associated with the inherent risks of OAuth2 flows if misconfigured, but the code itself is secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OAuth2 client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
