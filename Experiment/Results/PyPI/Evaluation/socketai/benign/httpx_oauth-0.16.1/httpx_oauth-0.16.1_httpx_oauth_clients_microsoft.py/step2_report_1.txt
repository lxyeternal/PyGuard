  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a standard OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures are present.\n- The token is used in HTTP headers for API calls, which is standard.\n- Exception handling appears appropriate.\n- The static SVG logo is harmless.\n- No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Correctly describes the flow; token passed to `get_profile` and `get_id_email`.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as legitimate, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The risk is minimal; 0.1 is appropriate given standard API interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; code is a standard OAuth2 client with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable due to external API interaction, but no actual vulnerabilities or malware are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar observations as above; the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Same pattern; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Consistent with previous; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code's functionality.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the inherent risks of API interactions but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (standard API client with minimal inherent risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
