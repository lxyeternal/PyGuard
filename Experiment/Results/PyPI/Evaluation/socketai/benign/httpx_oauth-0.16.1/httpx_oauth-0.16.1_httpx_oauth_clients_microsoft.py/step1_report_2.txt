{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API, enabling authentication and profile retrieval functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'token', 'redirect_uri', 'scope', and 'extras_params'. It also accesses response data from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "The token is used in HTTP Authorization headers, which is standard. The response JSON is parsed and returned; potential sinks include error handling where response objects are passed to exceptions.",
  "flows": "Tokens obtained from OAuth flows are used to access user profile data via HTTP GET requests; profile data is parsed and specific fields ('id', 'userPrincipalName') are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows are evident. The SVG logo is static content, not malicious. The code relies on standard OAuth2 library functions and standard HTTP requests.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard practices for OAuth2 clients. It dynamically formats URLs with tenant IDs, retrieves access tokens, and fetches user profile data securely. Error handling is appropriately managed with custom exceptions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. External library usage is normal. No signs of malicious data exfiltration or malware activities are observed. The only notable feature is the static SVG logo, which is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth2 client implementation for Microsoft Graph API with no malicious intent. It handles sensitive data appropriately and uses standard security practices.",
