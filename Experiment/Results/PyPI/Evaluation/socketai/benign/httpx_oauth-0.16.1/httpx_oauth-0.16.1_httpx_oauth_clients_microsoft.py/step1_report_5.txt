  "purpose": "This code implements an OAuth2 client for Microsoft Graph API, allowing authorization and profile retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from token argument in get_profile and get_id_email methods; reads configuration parameters during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses token in HTTP Authorization header for profile requests; raises exceptions with response data if errors occur.",
  "flows": "Token input -> HTTP GET request to Microsoft Graph API -> Response handling -> Profile data extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Usage of standard OAuth2 flow and exception handling. No suspicious URL or parameter modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward OAuth2 client implementation, utilizing standard libraries and practices. It securely retrieves profile data with proper exception handling. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors detected. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of a logo SVG, which is harmless. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and secure, with no signs of malicious intent. It performs standard OAuth2 authorization and profile retrieval using Microsoft Graph API. No security risks identified.",
