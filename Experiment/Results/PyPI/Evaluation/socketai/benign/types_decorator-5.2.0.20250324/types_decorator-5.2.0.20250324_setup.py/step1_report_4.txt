{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'types-decorator' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present; configuration parameters are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow present; static configuration data is used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python stub package. It uses static values for package metadata, URLs, and dependencies. All data is hardcoded and sourced from predefined variables. There are no inputs from external sources, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup with no malicious intent.",
