  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'types-decorator' Python library, providing metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining package metadata, URLs, dependencies, and package data; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, code execution, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to setup() parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard, static setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' for a Python package, containing only static variables and a call to setuptools.setup(). No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. All URLs and data point to legitimate repositories and documentation. The code adheres to standard packaging practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and justified based on static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. No further action is necessary.",
