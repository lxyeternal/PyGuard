  "purpose": "Defines the public interface of the module by listing exported names: 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'Agent'.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading; no data intake points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a simple list of exported names.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a list assignment to __all__, which controls what is exported when the module is imported. It is a common Python pattern for defining the public API of a module. There are no function calls, data processing, or suspicious constructs present. The code does not read input, access environment variables, or perform any operations that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of the module's public interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard practice code with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
