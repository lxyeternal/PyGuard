{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the public API of a module by explicitly exporting certain identifiers: 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'Agent'.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, data leakage points, or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only declares exported names.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the '__all__' attribute, which controls what is exported when the module is imported using 'from module import *'. It includes three identifiers: 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'Agent'. There are no other operations, data processing, or suspicious constructs. This is standard Python practice for module exports, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves to specify module exports. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
