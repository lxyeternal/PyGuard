{
  "purpose": "Defines a list of module components or symbols exported by the module, likely for import elsewhere.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets an exported symbol list.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a list assignment; no suspicious patterns, secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares an __all__ list with three string elements: 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'Agent'. This pattern is common for explicitly defining module exports in Python. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leakage mechanisms. No input handling, external communication, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
