  "purpose": "Declare the public API of the module by listing exported symbols.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a list of strings to the __all__ variable, which is a standard Python module attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are present; the code does not process or handle external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply defines a list for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of __all__, indicating the public symbols of the module. It contains no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements justify these assessments. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified. The code aligns with standard practices for module exports, especially in auto-generated contexts like Thrift or RPC code. The scores are consistent with the code's content, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module export declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0. No further action is required.",
  "confidence": 1,
