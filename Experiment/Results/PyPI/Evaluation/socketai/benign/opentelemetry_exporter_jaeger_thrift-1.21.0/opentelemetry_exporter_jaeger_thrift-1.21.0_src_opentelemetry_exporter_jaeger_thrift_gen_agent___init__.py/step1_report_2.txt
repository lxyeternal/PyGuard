{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be defining an __all__ list for a Python module, specifying exported names 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'Agent'.",
  "sources": "The source is the list assignment to __all__, which indicates the module's public API.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve these names if they are later used insecurely, but none are directly used here.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in this snippet, as it only defines a list of identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and common in generated or modular Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets the __all__ variable to specify module exports. It does not include any logic, data processing, or external data handling. The identifiers listed suggest it is part of a larger Thrift or RPC-generated module, which is typical for auto-generated code. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Since this is a minimal snippet, no signs of malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard __all__ declaration for a Python module, likely auto-generated, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
