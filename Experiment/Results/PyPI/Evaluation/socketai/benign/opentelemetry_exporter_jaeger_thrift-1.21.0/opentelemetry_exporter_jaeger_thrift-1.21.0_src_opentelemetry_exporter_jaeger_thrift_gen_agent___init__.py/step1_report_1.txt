{
  "purpose": "Defines the public API of the module by specifying exported symbols",
  "sources": "No data input sources are evident in this snippet",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only an __all__ declaration with string entries; no suspicious patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code declares the __all__ variable to specify which symbols are exported when the module is imported. The listed symbols include 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'Agent'. There is no evidence of data input, external data handling, or any logic that could be exploited maliciously. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and solely serves to define the module's public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
