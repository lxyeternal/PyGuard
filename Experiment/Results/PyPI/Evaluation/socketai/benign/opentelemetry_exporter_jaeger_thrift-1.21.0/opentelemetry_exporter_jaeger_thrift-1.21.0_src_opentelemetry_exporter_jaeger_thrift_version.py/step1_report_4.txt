  "purpose": "The code appears to be a part of a licensing and versioning header for a Python package, providing legal and version information.",
  "sources": "The source is the top comments and the __version__ variable assignment, which are static and hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only contains static information.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of comments and a simple version assignment with no executable logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard licensing header with a version variable. It contains no executable code, data input, or external interactions. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. It appears to be a typical license header for an open-source project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only licensing and versioning purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
