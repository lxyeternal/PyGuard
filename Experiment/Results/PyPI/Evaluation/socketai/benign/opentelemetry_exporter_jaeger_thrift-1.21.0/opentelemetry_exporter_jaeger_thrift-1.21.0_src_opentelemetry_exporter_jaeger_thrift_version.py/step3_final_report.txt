  "purpose": "This code serves as metadata for a Python package, indicating licensing information and defining the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only comments and a static version assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as there are no data inputs or outputs; the code is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a simple version string assignment, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static metadata with licensing comments and a version variable. No executable code, data processing, or external interactions are present. The comments are standard license notices, and the version assignment is straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence score of 1 reflects certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, containing only licensing comments and a version string. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The current assessment and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
