{
  "purpose": "Defines the list of exported symbols for a module, likely related to Zipkin tracing or collector functionality.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, only a list of strings; no unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a list containing 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'ZipkinCollector' to the special variable '__all__', which specifies the public API of the module. There are no data sources, no data sinks, and no complex logic or obfuscated elements. The code appears standard and typical for Python modules intending to control exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is straightforward and appears safe.",
