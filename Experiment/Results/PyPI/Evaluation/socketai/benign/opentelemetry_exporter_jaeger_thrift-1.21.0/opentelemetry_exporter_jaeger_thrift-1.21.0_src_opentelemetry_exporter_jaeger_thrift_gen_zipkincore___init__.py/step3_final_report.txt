  "purpose": "Declare the public symbols of the module for external use.",
  "sources": "N/A (no data input, hardcoded list assignment).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data or external output).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow, no execution beyond list assignment).",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward list assignment with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ as a list of strings indicating public API symbols. It contains no functions, data processing, external data sources, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a standard Python module pattern used for controlling symbol exports. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a high confidence that it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe and normal behavior.",
