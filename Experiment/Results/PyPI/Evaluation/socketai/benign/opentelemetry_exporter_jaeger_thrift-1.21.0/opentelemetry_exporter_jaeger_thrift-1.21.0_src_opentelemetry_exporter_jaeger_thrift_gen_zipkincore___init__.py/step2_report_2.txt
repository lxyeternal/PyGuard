  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple declaration of the `__all__` list, which specifies the public API of a Python module. The code is minimal, consisting solely of a list assignment, with no input/output, data processing, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   None of the reports find any anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is standard boilerplate used in Python modules to control symbol exports.\n\n3. **Risk and Malware Scores**:  \n   All reports assign a `malware` score of 0 and a `securityRisk` score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The `confidence` scores are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security concerns.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation & Recommendations**:  \n   Given the code snippet and the reports, I agree with their assessments. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or introduce security vulnerabilities. The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final Justification & Summary**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is straightforward, not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code snippet is a typical, benign module declaration. It presents no security concerns, no malware, and no obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
