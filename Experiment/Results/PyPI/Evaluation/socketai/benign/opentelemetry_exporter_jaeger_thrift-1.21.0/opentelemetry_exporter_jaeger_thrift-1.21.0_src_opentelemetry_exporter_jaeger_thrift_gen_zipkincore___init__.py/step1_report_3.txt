  "purpose": "Defines the public API components of the module by listing exported symbols.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares the __all__ list to specify module exports. There are no functions, no data reading, no external calls, and no complex logic. This is typical in Python modules for controlling symbol exports. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple declaration of exported symbols with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
