{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an __all__ list, which specifies public objects for module exports, including 'ttypes', 'constants', and 'ZipkinCollector'.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read input or data; it only defines a list of exported names.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects, as the code does not process any external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs; the code solely declares a list of string identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module-level variable assignment (__all__) used to specify the public API of the module. There are no suspicious or malicious elements. It does not perform any input/output operations, nor does it contain embedded code or hidden behaviors. The absence of further code or context limits the assessment, but based on this snippet alone, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical declaration of exported module symbols and contains no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
