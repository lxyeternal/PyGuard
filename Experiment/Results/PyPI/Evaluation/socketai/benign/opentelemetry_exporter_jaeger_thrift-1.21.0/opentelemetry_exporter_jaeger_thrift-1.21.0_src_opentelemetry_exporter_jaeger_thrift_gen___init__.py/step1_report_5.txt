  "purpose": "This code modifies the Python module search path by adding the directory of the current file.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file path via __file__",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present; no untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "The code appends the directory of the current script to sys.path, influencing module import paths",
  "anomalies": "The code simply alters sys.path; no suspicious or malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os.path.dirname, then appends the directory of the current script to sys.path. This is a common practice to include local modules for import. No hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated behavior is present. The code performs straightforward path modification without any malicious intent or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard operation to modify module search paths. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
