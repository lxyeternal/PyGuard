  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for local module import management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and dirname, then appends the directory of the current script to sys.path. This is a common, benign pattern used to ensure local modules can be imported correctly. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The code does not perform network operations, handle sensitive data, or execute untrusted code. The minimal security risk associated with this pattern is negligible, and the code's intent is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for managing local module imports in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code poses no threat and is safe to use.",
