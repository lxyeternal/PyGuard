  "purpose": "Dynamically modify the module search path by adding the directory of the current file.",
  "sources": "The current file path (__file__).",
  "sinks": "The sys.path list, which affects module import behavior.",
  "flows": "The code reads the current file path (__file__) and appends its directory to sys.path, influencing subsequent module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code simply manipulates the import path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules sys and os.path. It retrieves the directory of the current script using dirname(__file__) and appends this directory to sys.path, allowing for local module imports. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activities, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward and typical for adjusting import paths. No malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a standard operation to modify the module search path based on the script location. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
