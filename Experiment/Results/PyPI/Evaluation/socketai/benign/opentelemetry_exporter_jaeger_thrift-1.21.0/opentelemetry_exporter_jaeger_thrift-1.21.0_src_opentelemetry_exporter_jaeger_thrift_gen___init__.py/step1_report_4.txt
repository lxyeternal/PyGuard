  "purpose": "Modify the module search path by adding the directory of the current script",
  "sources": "sys.path (modification), __file__ (script filename)",
  "sinks": "Potentially affecting module imports, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "sys.path modification based on __file__ location",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code appends the directory of the current script to sys.path, which is a common practice for local imports. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for adjusting module search paths and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
