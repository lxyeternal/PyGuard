  "purpose": "The code modifies the system path to include the directory of the current file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's path (__file__) and the system path list (sys.path).",
  "sinks": "The code modifies sys.path by appending a directory, which could influence module imports.",
  "flows": "The code reads __file__ to determine current file location and then appends that directory to sys.path, affecting future imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; this is a common pattern to modify import paths dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and dirname, then adds the directory of the current script to sys.path. This is typically done to allow imports from the script's directory. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted input. It simply alters import path behavior, which is common in some codebases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, benign, and a common pattern for managing module imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
