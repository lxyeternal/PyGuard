{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be autogenerated by the Thrift compiler, defining constants for use in a Thrift-based communication protocol.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports modules and defines string constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink involving untrusted data; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated Thrift protocol definitions module, consisting solely of string constant assignments. It imports standard libraries and does not perform any I/O, data processing, or network communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content align with typical Thrift code generation output, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is an auto-generated, non-malicious Thrift protocol constants module with no security concerns.",
