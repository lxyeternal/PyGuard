{
  "purpose": "Generated code for Thrift protocol communication definitions, used for serialization/deserialization in RPC systems.",
  "sources": "Import statements from thrift library and local ttypes module; constant string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious payloads; no data handling or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; constants are static strings with no dynamic data or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is autogenerated, with a standard comment warning not to edit.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be an autogenerated Thrift protocol module defining constants and importing necessary modules. It does not include any data processing, input handling, or external communication logic. The presence of only static string constants and imports indicates a typical generated protocol file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leaks. The file's purpose is solely to define protocol constants for RPC communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, autogenerated Thrift protocol definition file with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains only static constants and necessary imports for serialization/deserialization. No suspicious activity or malware is present.",
