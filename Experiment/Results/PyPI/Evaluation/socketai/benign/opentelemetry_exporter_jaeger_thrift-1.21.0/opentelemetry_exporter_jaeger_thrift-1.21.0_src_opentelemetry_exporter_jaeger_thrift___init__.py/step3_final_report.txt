{
  "purpose": "A standard implementation of an OpenTelemetry Jaeger exporter that sends trace data over UDP or HTTP, configurable via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for host, port, endpoint, username, password, and other configurations; span resource attributes.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission via UDP (AgentClientUDP) or HTTP (Collector) to send trace batches to Jaeger.",
  "flows": "Span data is translated into Jaeger Thrift spans, batched, and sent over network to configured collector or agent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of deprecated modules noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard trace exporting functions, initializing network clients based on environment variables, translating spans, and transmitting them. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is present. The environment variable usage and network activity are typical for telemetry exporters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard OpenTelemetry Jaeger exporter with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified based on its functionality.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
