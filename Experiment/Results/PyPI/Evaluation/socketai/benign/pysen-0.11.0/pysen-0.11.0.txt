The security risk is minimal and justified by the external command execution, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a plugin loader with validation, but its reliance on external inputs makes it susceptible to malicious modules or functions if inputs are compromised. It does not contain malware internally, but the potential for malicious activity exists depending on input trustworthiness. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; however, the higher malware scores in some reports overstate the maliciousness of the code itself. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to dynamic execution of external code, not because of embedded malicious code."

The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The low risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects the potential vector of external plugin execution, which is standard in such systems. Overall, the code appears secure and safe for use."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to reliance on external modules. No further action is necessary."
