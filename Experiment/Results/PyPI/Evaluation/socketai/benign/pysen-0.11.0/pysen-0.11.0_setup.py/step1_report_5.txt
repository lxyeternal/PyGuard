{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pysen' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'pysen/_version.py', reading 'README.md' for long description, and importing external packages for setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sources or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Read version file -> setup configuration -> package installation requirements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed. Use of 'exec' to execute version file is typical in setup scripts, though it could be marginally risky if the file is compromised. The version variable is imported from a local file, not from external input.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of 'exec' to load the version number, which is common but slightly risky if the version file is malicious or tampered with. However, no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The dependencies and code structure are typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent. It relies on local files and standard Python packaging practices, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
