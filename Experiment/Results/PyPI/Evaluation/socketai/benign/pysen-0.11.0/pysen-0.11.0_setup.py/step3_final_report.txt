{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'pysen' Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'pysen/_version.py' via exec, reads 'README.md' for long description, static dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks; static files only.",
  "flows": "Executes '_version.py' to obtain version, reads README.md, sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate internal version file; no other anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security concern. The exec() pattern on a local version file is common but could be risky if the file is malicious. No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, standard, and free from malicious activity. The only minor concern is the exec() pattern, which is acceptable in controlled environments. Overall, the code poses negligible security risk.",
