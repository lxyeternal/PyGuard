  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for the 'pysen' package.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `exec()` to load the version from `pysen/_version.py`.\n- No reports mention any untrusted data input, network activity, or runtime code execution beyond the `exec()`.\n- All dependencies and package data are static and well-defined.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- The code does **not** contain malicious payloads or malicious behaviors.\n- The use of `exec()` on an internal version file is common but could be considered a minimal security risk if the file is tampered with. However, this is a standard pattern in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the `exec()` pattern as potentially risky but also note its commonality. They generally conclude the script is safe.\n- The risk scores assigned are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), which is appropriate given the context.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk associated with `exec()` usage, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- The only point of concern is the `exec()` on an internal version file. While common, if the `_version.py` file were compromised, it could execute malicious code. However, given that this is a local, controlled file, the risk remains minimal.\n- No report suggests any actual compromise or malicious content.\n\n### Consistency:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No report overstates or understates the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscated code.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal risk due to `exec()`, but standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nConsidering all points, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — acceptable minimal risk, given the pattern.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The setup script is standard, with a common pattern of loading version info via `exec()`. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | My Estimate |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Risk            | 0.1          |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the reasoning in the reports.",
