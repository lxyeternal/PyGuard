  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pysen' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from an external file, reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata fields, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data processing or execution occurs from external sources.",
  "flows": "Static reads from version file and README.md, no untrusted input flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns. The use of 'exec' to evaluate '_version.py' could be risky if the file contents are malicious, but this is standard practice for version retrieval and does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No other anomalies noted.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for packaging a Python project using setuptools. It reads the version from an external '_version.py' file via 'exec', which is common in setup scripts, although potentially risky if the file content is malicious; however, it is unlikely here. It reads 'README.md' for long description, defines dependencies, and specifies package metadata and entry points. No user input, network access, or dynamic code execution beyond this standard pattern is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal, well-structured setup configuration for a Python package. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks beyond the minimal risk associated with executing a version file, which is a common practice. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
