  "conclusion": "The code functions as a plugin loader with validation, but its reliance on external inputs makes it susceptible to malicious modules or functions if inputs are compromised. It does not contain malware internally, but the potential for malicious activity exists depending on input trustworthiness. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; however, the higher malware scores in some reports overstate the maliciousness of the code itself. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to dynamic execution of external code, not because of embedded malicious code."
