{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for integrating the 'black' Python code formatter into a larger linting framework, allowing for formatting and checking of Python files.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided file paths and project configuration files such as 'pyproject.toml'. It reads file paths and configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with the 'black_wrapper.run' function, which executes formatting or linting operations. It does not process or execute untrusted data directly but relies on external libraries.",
  "flows": "The flow involves collecting source files and configuration paths, then passing them to 'black_wrapper.run' for formatting or linting. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code uses standard library calls and common design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured around classes that manage the invocation of the 'black' formatter. It carefully constructs command objects and manages configuration settings. It does not include any suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious data handling. The reliance on an external 'black_wrapper' module appears to be a standard practice for integrating third-party tools. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of integrating the 'black' formatter into a Python linting framework. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
