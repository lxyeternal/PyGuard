  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured integration component for the 'black' formatter, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to reliance on external modules. No further action is necessary."
