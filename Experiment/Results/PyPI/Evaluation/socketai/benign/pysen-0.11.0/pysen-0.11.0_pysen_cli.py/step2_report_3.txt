  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security concerns, correctness, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code functions as a CLI for a Python package management/build tool, with configuration loading, command parsing, and execution control.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, standard error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThe low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern, which seems reasonable given the code's straightforward nature. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard CLI operations, configuration, and target management.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation, standard libraries, and safe error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAgain, scores are consistent with the code's nature. The very low risk score is justified. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a CLI for the 'pysen' tool, handling configuration, targets, and execution.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation, standard flow, safe error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nScores align well with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar description—CLI for managing/running tasks, with configuration and execution.\n- **Assessment:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAppropriate scoring. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard CLI for project management, no malicious activity, safe handling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nScores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports consistently identify the code as a standard CLI orchestrator with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature. Malware scores are zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, typical for CLI tools without external threats)\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical CLI interface managing configuration, execution, and output formatting. No indicators of supply chain compromise, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the static analysis. No adjustments needed.",
