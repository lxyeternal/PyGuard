  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python project related to Pysen, a hypothetical or specific build or configuration system.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data; no sources identified.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or processes untrusted data; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions. It imports a type alias for paths but does not perform any operations, input reading, or data processing. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions, is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network operations, or obfuscated constructs. The structure is straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
