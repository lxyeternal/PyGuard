  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code solely defines custom exception classes.\n- No data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with some constructors accepting parameters for detailed error messages.\n- No external dependencies beyond a local import are used, and no external data is handled.\n\n**Security and Malware Assessment:**\n- Given the nature of the code, it is purely structural, intended for error handling.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the absence of any security issues.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- Since the code is just class definitions, there's no reason to assign a higher risk unless the code were part of a larger, suspicious package. However, as standalone, the risk is negligible.\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made in the reports; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious intent. The assessments are correct, and the scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.",
