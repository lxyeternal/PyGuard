{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the Pysen project, primarily for error handling and categorization.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user input, or environment variables are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of exception class initialization appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Some classes include constructors that format error messages with provided parameters, such as file paths or names. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data handling is present. The code serves as a structure for error reporting without any embedded logic that could be malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of custom exceptions for error handling within a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. It functions solely to categorize errors, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
