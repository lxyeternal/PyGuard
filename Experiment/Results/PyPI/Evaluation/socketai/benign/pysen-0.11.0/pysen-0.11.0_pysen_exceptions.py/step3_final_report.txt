{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling within the Pysen project.",
  "sources": "Class constructors accepting parameters like 'name', 'module_path', 'error', or 'path' for error message formatting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class. It imports 'Optional' and a local 'PathLikeType' but does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The constructors format error messages but do not execute unsafe operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is purely structural for error categorization, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and secure. It poses no supply chain security threat or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
