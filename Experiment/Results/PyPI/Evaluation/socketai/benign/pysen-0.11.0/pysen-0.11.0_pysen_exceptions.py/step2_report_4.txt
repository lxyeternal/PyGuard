  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code solely consists of custom exception class definitions. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The code is static, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:  \n   No errors or flaws are noted in the logic or implementation. The exception classes are well-structured, with some constructors accepting parameters for detailed error messages, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable since the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature as error class definitions.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities; they correctly identify that this code does not handle untrusted data or perform any security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's content.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - The code imports `Optional` from `typing` and a local `PathLikeType`, but these are only used in class constructors and do not introduce any risk.  \n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Final assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes. It poses no security threats, malware risks, or supply chain concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation**:  \n- The code is benign and typical for error handling.  \n- No changes needed in the scores.  \n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is safe and free from malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0",
