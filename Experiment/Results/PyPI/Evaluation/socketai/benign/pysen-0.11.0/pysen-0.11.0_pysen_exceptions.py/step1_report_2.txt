{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a Python project related to 'Pysen' and plugin handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; only class definitions and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from base Exception classes. It includes some initial imports, notably 'Optional' from 'typing' and a local import from '.path'. All classes are straightforward, mainly serving as custom error types with optional initialization parameters. There is no data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution present. No code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation identified. The code is standard for defining error classes, and no suspicious or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling within a Python project. It poses no security threats, malware risks, or malicious intent. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
