{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python project related to Pysen, a tool possibly for build or configuration management.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or output generation with external impact.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code consists solely of standard class definitions and constructors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base PysenError class. Some classes initialize with parameters such as 'name', 'module_path', 'error', or 'path' but do not perform any unsafe or malicious operations. The code does not include any data handling, network activity, or environment variable usage. No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The overall structure appears standard for exception handling in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward definition of custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is standard boilerplate code for error handling within a larger application.",
