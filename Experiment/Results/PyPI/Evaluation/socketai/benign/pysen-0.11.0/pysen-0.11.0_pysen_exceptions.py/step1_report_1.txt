  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Pysen project to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "None; this code only defines classes and does not read input or external data.",
  "targets": "None; no data flows from sources to sinks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present in the code; it solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and a relative PathLikeType, then defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from PysenError. Each class is for specific error scenarios related to the Pysen system, with some constructors accepting parameters for error messages. The code is straightforward, structured, and does not include any dynamic code execution, network access, or other suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for error handling in a larger system and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard practice for defining custom exceptions.",
