{
  "purpose": "The code provides a framework for running linting and formatting checks on source files within a directory, potentially with git integration and reporting capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads source files from the file system via resolve_files, open() for reading and writing file contents, and possibly from the source object.",
  "sinks": "File write operations during in-place edits; reading files with open(). No untrusted input handling explicitly shown, but file I/O could be a potential data leak point if combined with malicious input.",
  "flows": "Source: resolve_files or file.open() -> check() or format() methods -> write() during in-place edits or diagnostics output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of difflib for diff generation is standard for formatting tools.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for linting and formatting source files with methods to select files, check their formatting, and optionally modify them. It uses standard Python libraries and file operations. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted inputs is evident. The open() calls are for reading and writing files, typical for such tools. The code relies on external modules (git_utils, parse_error_diffs) which are not shown but appear to serve benign purposes. No obfuscated code patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard framework for code linting and formatting with no malicious intent or malicious code present. It performs file reading, writing, and diff generation in a typical manner, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
