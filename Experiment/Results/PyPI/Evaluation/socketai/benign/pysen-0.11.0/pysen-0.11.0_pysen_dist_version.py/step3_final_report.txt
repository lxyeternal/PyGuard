  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of a specified installed Python package using importlib.metadata, raising an exception if not found.",
  "sources": "The package name provided as input to get_version(), and the distribution data retrieved via importlib.metadata.distribution().",
  "sinks": "The version string extracted from the distribution object, used to create a VersionRepresentation.",
  "flows": "Input package name -> _get_distro() retrieves distribution -> get_version() processes distribution -> VersionRepresentation.from_str() creates version object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of standard library functions and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly attempts to retrieve a package's distribution; if not found, logs a debug message and raises a custom exception. When found, it converts the version string into a VersionRepresentation object. The code is simple, clear, and does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation. The provided reports are empty and contain no details, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Given the lack of evidence, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is minimal (0.1) due to the absence of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, correct, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports do not indicate any issues; thus, the overall security risk is very low. The scores should reflect this, with no malware or obfuscation concerns and a negligible risk level.",
