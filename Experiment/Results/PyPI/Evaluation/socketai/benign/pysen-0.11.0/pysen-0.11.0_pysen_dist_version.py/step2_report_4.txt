  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Review:**\n   - The code defines `_get_distro()` which attempts to retrieve a package distribution via `importlib.metadata.distribution()`.\n   - If the package isn't found, it logs a debug message and returns `None`.\n   - The `get_version()` function calls `_get_distro()`, raises a custom `DistributionNotFound` exception if `None`, otherwise returns a `VersionRepresentation` object created from the distribution's version string.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears correct in its logic:\n     - Proper exception handling for missing packages.\n     - Correct use of `importlib.metadata`.\n     - Clear error messaging.\n   - No evident security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with an empty `\"raw_response\"` and no additional details.\n   - These reports do not provide any concrete findings, vulnerabilities, or suspicious activity.\n   - The uniformity of the reports suggests they might be placeholders, incomplete, or lack relevant information.\n\n4. **Assessment of Report Validity and Scores:**\n   - Since the reports contain no detailed findings, errors, or evidence of malicious activity, there is no basis to assign high malware or risk scores.\n   - The reports do not challenge or reveal any flaws in the code.\n   - The \"Empty response\" indicates no issues or insights were provided.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n   - **Code correctness:** The code is functionally correct and secure.\n   - **Report validity:** The reports are empty and do not contain actionable information.\n   - **Scores:**\n     - Malware score: Should be **0**, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n     - Obfuscated score: Should be **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n     - Risk score: Should be **0**, given no evidence of vulnerabilities or issues.\n\n6. **Additional Notes:**\n   - If future reports contain detailed findings, re-evaluate accordingly.\n   - The current \"Empty response\" reports do not warrant concern.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the absence of any evidence or claims of issues in the provided reports.",
