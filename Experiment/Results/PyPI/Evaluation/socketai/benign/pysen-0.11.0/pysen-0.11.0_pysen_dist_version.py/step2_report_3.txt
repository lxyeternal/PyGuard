  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:**\n\n- The reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content for reports 1 through 5.\n- Since the reports contain no details, there are no explicit issues or vulnerabilities described.\n- Based solely on the code provided, there are no observable security flaws, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**2. Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:**\n\n- The reports lack any content or explanation; thus, no errors or flaws can be identified from them.\n- The code appears straightforward, with proper exception handling for missing packages, and no apparent security issues.\n\n**3. Review the scores given to each issue:**\n\n- Since no issues are described, there are no scores to evaluate or adjust.\n\n**4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:**\n\n- No risks are indicated, so risk scores should be minimal or zero.\n\n**5. Pay close attention to the malware score:**\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, network access, or data exfiltration.\n- No malware-related concerns are evident.\n\n**6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n\n- Without detailed reports, assumptions about vulnerabilities cannot be substantiated.\n- The code's logic is standard for package version retrieval and exception handling.\n\n**7. Ensure scores are consistent with the report:**\n\n- Given the lack of details, scores should reflect no known issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no identified vulnerabilities or risks)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The reports are empty; thus, no security concerns are evident from the provided data.\n- The code itself appears correct and secure for its intended purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the available information, I recommend **no changes** to the scores. The incident reports do not indicate any actual issues, and the code is straightforward and secure.",
