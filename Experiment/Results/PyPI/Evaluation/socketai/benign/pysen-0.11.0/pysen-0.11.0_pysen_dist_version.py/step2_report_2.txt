  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nThe reports indicate \"Empty response\" for reports 1 through 5, which suggests no specific issues or details were provided. Therefore, I cannot confirm any particular vulnerabilities or errors based on the reports. The code itself appears to be straightforward and does not exhibit obvious security flaws.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary.**  \nSince the reports contain no details, I cannot identify any errors or flaws in their reasoning. The absence of detailed responses prevents further analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores given to each issue.**  \nNo scores are provided in the reports, so I cannot evaluate their reasonableness or suggest changes.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5.**  \nNo risk scores are provided, and without specific issues, I cannot justify high risk scores.\n\n**Step 5: Pay close attention to the malware score.**  \nAgain, no malware scores are provided, and the reports lack details, so I cannot assess malicious activity.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.**  \nSince no claims or details are provided, I cannot challenge any assumptions.\n\n**Step 7: Make sure the scores are consistent with the report.**  \nNo scores or detailed reports are available, so consistency cannot be evaluated.\n\n---\n\n### Additional analysis of the code itself:\n\n- The code is a utility to fetch the version of an installed package using `importlib.metadata`.  \n- It raises a custom exception if the package isn't found, which is standard practice.  \n- The logic is straightforward, with no apparent security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.  \n- The only potential concern is the reliance on `distribution()` which could, in rare cases, be manipulated if an attacker controls the environment, but this is a general environment concern rather than a code flaw.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected or suggested)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mainly environment-related, not code-related)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nGiven the lack of detailed reports, the code appears secure and well-structured. The absence of specific issues or malicious indicators suggests very low risk and malware scores. The only notable point is that the reports do not provide any actionable information.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment is conservative, reflecting the lack of evidence for any issues.",
