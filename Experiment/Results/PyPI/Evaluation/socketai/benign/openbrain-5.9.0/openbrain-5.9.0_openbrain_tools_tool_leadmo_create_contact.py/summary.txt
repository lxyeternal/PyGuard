  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the handling of external JSON input without validation, which should be addressed for production hardening but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1–0.2, aligning with the provided reports."
