  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up environment variables and checking for the existence of a configuration file (.env).",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('OB_MODE') and os.path.exists('.env')",
  "sinks": "Setting environment variable 'OB_MODE' to 'LOCAL'",
  "flows": "If '.env' does not exist and 'OB_MODE' is not set, then set 'OB_MODE' to 'LOCAL'",
  "anomalies": "Commented out code; no active malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for a '.env' file in the current working directory and whether the environment variable 'OB_MODE' is set. If the file is missing and the environment variable is unset, it sets 'OB_MODE' to 'LOCAL' and prints a message. All actions are benign, related to configuration setup. There are no suspicious data flows, no code injection, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and commented out sections do not execute.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign configuration check and setup for environment variables. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is present.",
