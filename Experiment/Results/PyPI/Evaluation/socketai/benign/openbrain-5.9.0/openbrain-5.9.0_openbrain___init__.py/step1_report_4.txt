  "anomalies": "Commented out code; no active code execution. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the current working directory, check for a '.env' file, and set an environment variable 'OB_MODE' to 'LOCAL' if neither the file exists nor the environment variable is set. However, all operational code is commented out, meaning none of this logic executes. There are no active data flows, no reading of untrusted input, and no writing to sensitive data or network operations. The code appears to be an inactive or placeholder snippet with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inactive, does not perform any operations at runtime, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be commented-out setup code with no security issues.",
