  "purpose": "A placeholder tool that performs no action but optionally logs its invocation details.",
  "sources": "JSON input data parsed from self.tool_input, including context, agent_config, session_id, and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "OBTool.record_action function, which logs action details; potential for sensitive data exposure if context contains secrets.",
  "flows": "Input JSON parsed -> context and agent_config extracted -> if record_tool_actions enabled, call OBTool.record_action with event and response data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; placeholder functions are empty; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'do nothing' utility that optionally logs actions. It parses JSON inputs safely, calls an external logging function, and returns a success message. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The potential security concern is the logging of possibly sensitive data, but this is standard practice and not inherently insecure. The functions are simple, and the overall structure is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
