  "purpose": "Implements a CLI interface for interacting with a GPT-based agent, handling user input, configuration, and displaying environment info.",
  "sources": "User input via command line or prompt, configuration retrieval via Defaults and AgentConfig, reading a static environment example file.",
  "sinks": "Passing user messages to the external GptAgent, printing responses, reading and printing the environment file.",
  "flows": "User input → handle_user_message() in GptAgent → output display; configuration retrieval → agent instantiation; reading environment file → output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative path '../.env.example' could be misused if directory structure is manipulated, but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around an external GPT agent, with configuration handling and environment file reading. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. External dependencies ('GptAgent', 'AgentConfig') are not shown, so potential risks depend on their implementation, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident. User input is directly passed to the agent, but this is standard practice. The reading of a static environment file is benign. The code uses defaults and relative paths, which are common but should be managed carefully. Overall, the code appears benign with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI interface with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The external components could pose risks if malicious, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
