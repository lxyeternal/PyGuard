{
  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration settings for an AWS-based application, manages environment variables, and handles infrastructure resource lookups via CloudFormation. It sets up logging, detects AWS region, and implements singleton pattern for configuration access.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., LOG_LEVEL, AWS_REGION, various resource names), boto3 sessions and responses, dotenv load, environment variable access within Config class.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily reads from environment and AWS services without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Config class fields → AWS SDK calls for resource info → usage in infrastructure setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code. The code interacts with AWS services and environment variables normally.",
  "analysis": "The code is a configuration setup module for an AWS Lambda or similar environment, loading environment variables, setting defaults, and querying CloudFormation for resource outputs. It uses safe patterns such as lazy loading of infrastructure outputs and singleton design. There is no code that performs network calls beyond AWS SDK interactions, no dynamic execution, no backdoors or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; all sensitive data is expected to come from environment variables or AWS infrastructure outputs. The code adheres to standard practices and does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and infrastructure resource handler with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads data securely from environment and AWS services, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
