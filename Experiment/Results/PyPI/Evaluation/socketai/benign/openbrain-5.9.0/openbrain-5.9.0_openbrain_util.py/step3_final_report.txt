  "sources": "Environment variables, dotenv loading, boto3 AWS SDK calls for CloudFormation stack description, environment variable access for resource names.",

  "flows": "Environment variables → Config class attributes → AWS SDK calls for resource resolution → logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard exception handling, commented benign code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard infrastructure setup, environment variable management, and resource discovery through AWS CloudFormation. It uses boto3 and dotenv appropriately, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. Logging is used for warnings and debugging, which is typical but should be protected in production. Exception handling for AWS calls is standard. The code's purpose is configuration and resource resolution, with no network activity beyond AWS SDK calls. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign infrastructure configuration module for AWS, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily operational. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate given the context.",
