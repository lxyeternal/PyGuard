{
  "purpose": "This code configures environment variables, AWS infrastructure, and logging for an application called 'openbrain', including AWS resource discovery and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., LOG_LEVEL, AWS_REGION, resource names), boto3 AWS SDK for infrastructure queries, dotenv for loading environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as resource names and configuration values that could leak if logs are exposed, or if environment variables contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Configuration class attributes → AWS SDK calls (describe_stacks) → Resource name resolution → Logging outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code injections detected. Usage of environment variables and AWS SDK is standard. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names. Commented out code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management and infrastructure resource resolution via AWS CloudFormation. It loads environment variables, detects AWS regions, configures logging, and dynamically resolves resource names from a central infrastructure stack. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The only potential concern could be if environment variables or logs leak sensitive data, but this appears to be part of normal operational code. The use of third-party libraries like boto3 and dotenv is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard configuration and infrastructure setup code with no malicious intent. It does not contain any malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks beyond typical configuration practices. The security risk score is low, and confidence is high that this is safe.",
