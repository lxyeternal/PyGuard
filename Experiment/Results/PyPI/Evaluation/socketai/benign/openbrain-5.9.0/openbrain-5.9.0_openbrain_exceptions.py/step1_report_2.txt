  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for missing environment variables.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code solely defines an exception class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definition with no execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "None; simple class definition with no unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class named ObMissingEnvironmentVariable inheriting from Exception. It does not include any logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code. The minimal structure suggests it’s used to signal specific error conditions related to environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat or suspicious activity.",
