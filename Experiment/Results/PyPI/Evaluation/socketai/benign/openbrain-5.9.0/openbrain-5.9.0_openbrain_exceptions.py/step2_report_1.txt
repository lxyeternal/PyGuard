  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception `ObMissingEnvironmentVariable`.\n   - The code contains no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no security risks, and no obfuscation, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is purely a class definition for an exception, which is a common pattern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - There is no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python class for a custom exception. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and is purely structural. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scoring and conclude that this code snippet does not present any security concern.",
