  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only a class definition.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist; the code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward class inheriting from Exception, serving as a custom error indicator. It contains no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's purpose is standard in Python for custom exceptions, and no security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
