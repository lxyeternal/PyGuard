  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for missing environment variables",
  "sources": "No data sources; class definition does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple exception subclass with no methods or data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class definition that inherits from Exception, used to signal a specific error condition related to missing environment variables. There are no data reads, no processing, and no potentially malicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign class definition with no malicious intent or security issues.",
