  "flows": "No data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, standard exception class with no unusual features or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward, harmless class definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It is likely used elsewhere in a larger codebase to handle missing environment variables.",
