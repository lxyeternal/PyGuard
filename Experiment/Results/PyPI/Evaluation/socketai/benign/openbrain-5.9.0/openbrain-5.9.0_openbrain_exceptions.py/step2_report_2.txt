  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple class definition for `ObMissingEnvironmentVariable` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks.\n   - No methods, data manipulation, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and lacks malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given & Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The `securityRisk` is also 0, consistent with the code's harmlessness.\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's purpose and limitations.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified based on the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
