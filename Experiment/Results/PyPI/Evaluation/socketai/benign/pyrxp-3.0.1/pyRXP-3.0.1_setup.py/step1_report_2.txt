{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and builds the pyRXP Python package, handling configuration, environment variables, and compilation of C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, reading files ('setup.py', 'LICENSE.txt', 'pyRXP.c'), command-line arguments, and source code files for version info.",
  "sinks": "Executing system commands ('os.system'), changing directories, importing setup and extension modules, raising custom exceptions, and reading files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line arguments influence conditional logic and build configuration; reading source files provides version info; 'os.system' executes build commands based on command-line inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard setup patterns, environment variable handling, and source file reading. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs setup and build operations for a Python extension module, with environment-aware compilation flags and file reading for versioning. It uses standard practices for package configuration, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. System command execution is limited to build processes, and no network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup script for the pyRXP package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard build procedures and does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
