  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing harness for pyRXPU with no malicious intent. The primary security issue is the use of eval() on parser flags, which could be exploited if flags are manipulated externally. No malware, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low but warrants caution regarding eval() usage."
