{
  "purpose": "The code reads an XML file and parses it using the pyRXPU library, displaying the parsed data unless suppressed by the -n flag.",
  "sources": "Reading the filename from command-line arguments, reading XML content from the specified file, and importing the pyRXPU parser.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code does not write or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "User supplies filename via command-line → File is read into memory → Content is parsed with pyRXP.Parser() → Parsed data is optionally printed.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.chdir and os.getcwd() to change and restore the working directory, which could be a subtle way to influence environment state. No apparent obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it processes an input XML file, parses it with a third-party library, and prints the result unless suppressed. The use of pyRXPU is external, and the code does not perform any network activity or system modification. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident. The directory change is controlled and temporary, not malicious. No suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard XML parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It relies on an external library for parsing and handles input/output securely within its scope.",
