  "purpose": "This script is a configuration file for generating documentation using Sphinx for the pyRXP project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import sys, os`), configuration variables, and list definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration variables are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code strictly sets configuration parameters for documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script containing metadata, theme settings, extension lists, and output options. All variables are statically assigned, and there are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations. The import of 'sys' and 'os' is common in configuration files but does not perform any malicious actions. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are identified. The script solely configures documentation build parameters, with no indication of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration file used for documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments. The script's purpose is purely to define settings for Sphinx documentation generation.",
