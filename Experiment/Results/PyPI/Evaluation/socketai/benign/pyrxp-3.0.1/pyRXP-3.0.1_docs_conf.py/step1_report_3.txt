  "purpose": "Configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation for the pyRXP project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os), configuration variables (extensions, paths, metadata).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no code executes untrusted input, nor does it perform data leaks or external network communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity; configuration variables are static and used for documentation setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard Sphinx configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It sets up paths, project metadata, and output formats without executing any dynamic or untrusted code. No external data is read or transmitted at runtime. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code's structure and content are consistent with a typical documentation setup, and no suspicious patterns or code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
