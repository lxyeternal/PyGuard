  "purpose": "The code defines a RoofSpecification class used for generating, modifying, and analyzing roof geometries in a building modeling context. It provides methods for geometric transformations, overlaps, splitting, and spatial analysis related to roof geometries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as geometry (list of Face3D), polygons, lines, and room data; accesses class properties like boundary_geometry_2d, planes, and geometry. Also reads from external classes such as Face3D, Polygon2D, Vector3D, Point3D, and Ladybug geometry functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from input sources to perform geometric modifications, boolean operations, and spatial analyses. No data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into geometric operations (e.g., move, rotate, scale, split, boolean difference). No external or untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to sensitive data leaks or command injection. Geometries are manipulated internally with well-defined geometric functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual obfuscated code are present. The code uses extensive geometric processing, but all functions are standard geometric operations. No suspicious code constructs or attempts at malicious behavior are evident. No hidden network calls or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive geometric class for roof modeling with methods for geometric transformations, overlaps, boolean operations, and spatial analyses. All functions use standard geometry libraries and perform typical calculations relevant to building modeling. No external system calls, network activity, or file operations that could indicate malicious intent are present. The use of boolean operations and splitting is consistent with modeling workflows, not malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are identified. The overall structure and behavior suggest a utility for 3D geometry management within a building modeling context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured geometric processing module for roof modeling without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard geometric calculations and does not contain malicious signals or behaviors. The overall security risk is very low, and confidence in this conclusion is high.",
