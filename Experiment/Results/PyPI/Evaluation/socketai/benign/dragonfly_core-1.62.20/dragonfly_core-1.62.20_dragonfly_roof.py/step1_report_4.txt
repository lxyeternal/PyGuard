{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for specifying and manipulating roof geometries in a 3D modeling context, including operations like union, intersection, translation, rotation, and validation against room geometries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters, such as geometry data, polygons, line segments, and plane definitions. It also reads data from external objects like Room2Ds and Ladybug geometry classes (e.g., Face3D, Polygon2D). It uses class attributes and method arguments as sources of data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could influence geometric operations if input parameters (e.g., polygons, lines, matrices) are maliciously crafted. The code performs boolean operations and projections that could, in theory, be manipulated, but these are standard geometric operations. No direct system or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data such as polygons, line segments, and geometric parameters flow into methods like union_coplanar, resolved_geometry, move, rotate_xy, reflect, scale, align, pull_to_segments, and split methods. These flows result in modifications to the internal geometry representation. No external system calls or network operations are present that could carry malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalous or suspicious code patterns such as hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard geometry operations and assertions. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or similar constructs are present. The functions perform legitimate geometric computations and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive set of geometric operations for roof design, including union, overlap resolution, splitting, movement, rotation, and alignment. It relies heavily on ladybug_geometry classes, which are well-known in architectural modeling. The logic appears straightforward and consistent with 3D geometry manipulation. No code suggests malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system control, or network communication. The code contains assertions and exception handling for geometric validity. The only notable aspect is the extensive geometry processing, which is typical for this domain. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geometric processing module for architectural roof modeling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on static analysis. It appears safe and legitimate within its scope. The overall security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
