  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard geometric processing module for roof modeling with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the nature of geometric operations and lack of external interactions."
