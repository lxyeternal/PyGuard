{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically finds and imports modules that start with 'dragonfly_' to extend the functionality of the Dragonfly core library.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.iter_modules() for discovering modules, importlib.import_module(name) for importing modules",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but importlib.import_module could execute code in the imported modules",
  "flows": "pkgutil.iter_modules() -> importlib.import_module(name)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual patterns. Use of dynamic import may be risky if modules are untrusted, but this is standard plugin loading.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging, then searches for modules starting with 'dragonfly_' using pkgutil.iter_modules(). It attempts to import each such module with importlib.import_module(). If import fails, it logs an exception; if successful, it logs the success. The process is typical for plugin systems. No suspicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors is evident. No sensitive data is read or written. The dynamic import relies on the modules discovered in the environment, which could be manipulated if untrusted modules are present, but this is typical for plugin architectures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader pattern, dynamically importing modules with a specific naming convention. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The risk depends on the trustworthiness of the modules found in the environment, but the code itself is benign.",
