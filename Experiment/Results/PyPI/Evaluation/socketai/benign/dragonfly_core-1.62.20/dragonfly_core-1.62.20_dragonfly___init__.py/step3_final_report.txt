{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically discovers and imports modules starting with 'dragonfly_' as plugins, enhancing core functionality.",
  "sources": "Module list obtained via pkgutil.iter_modules() and module names from environment.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module(name) where untrusted module names could lead to malicious code execution if modules are compromised.",
  "flows": "Module names from iter_modules() -> importlib.import_module(name) -> potential execution of malicious code during import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward plugin loader pattern. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plugin discovery by listing modules and importing those with 'dragonfly_' prefix. It includes exception handling and logging. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of modules in the environment; if malicious modules are present, they could execute upon import. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting environment trust assumptions. The code itself is benign and follows common plugin patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risk stems from environment trustworthiness, not the code itself. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
