  "flows": "pkgutil.iter_modules() -> importlib.import_module() for each module name starting with 'dragonfly_'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard dynamic module loading pattern; exception handling for import failures",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a logger, then iterates over available modules in the environment. It filters for modules starting with 'dragonfly_', attempting to import each one dynamically. If an import fails, it logs an exception; otherwise, it logs success. This approach is common for plugin systems. The use of exception handling prevents crashes on import failures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. However, dynamically importing modules based on the environment can potentially be risky if malicious modules are present, but this depends on the trusted source of installed modules. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate plugin loader with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin discovery and import mechanism. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only consideration is the trustworthiness of the modules being imported, which is outside the scope of static review. No malicious intent detected.",
