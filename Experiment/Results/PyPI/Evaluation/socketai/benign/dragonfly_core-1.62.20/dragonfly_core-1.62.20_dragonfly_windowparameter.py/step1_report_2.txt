  "purpose": "Define classes and methods for configuring and manipulating window parameters in architectural models, including geometric calculations, transformations, and representations for various window types.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (`ladybug_geometry`, `honeybee`) and the class methods that process input data, such as `from_dict()` and `from_face3ds()` which create objects from external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate geometries (`add_window_to_face`, `to_rectangular_windows`, `offset`, `union_overlaps`, `merge_and_simplify`) which process and modify geometrical data; no network or data exfiltration code is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures (dictionaries, polygons, face objects) into class instances via `from_dict()` and `from_face3ds()`. These objects are then transformed through geometric operations such as scaling, flipping, offsetting, and merging, but no external communications or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "The code involves extensive geometric operations and object copying. No suspicious code or behavior such as network requests, file access, or data exfiltration is observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code segments are present. No malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various window parameter configurations, including geometric calculations, transformations, and data serialization/deserialization. All functions perform typical operations related to geometry and data handling, with no signs of malicious behavior. The imports are from reputable external libraries, and there are no network or file system interactions or commands that could be malicious. The methods are consistent with their documented purpose and contain no suspicious or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard and well-structured implementation of architectural window modeling classes and methods. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or data exfiltration. The code is designed solely for geometry manipulation, data serialization, and transformation tasks related to window modeling. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
