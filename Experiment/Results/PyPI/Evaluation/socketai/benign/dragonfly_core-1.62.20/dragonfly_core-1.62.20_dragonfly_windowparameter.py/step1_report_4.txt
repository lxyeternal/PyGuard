{
  "purpose": "Define various classes for representing and manipulating window parameters in architectural modeling, including geometric transformations, merging, splitting, and creating window geometries within a building model.",
  "sources": "User data stored in 'user_data' properties; input data for from_dict methods; geometric inputs like polygons, points, segments, and face3ds; boundary condition objects.",
  "sinks": "Application of user_data to honeybee objects; creation of window apertures and doors on faces; geometric operations that modify polygon vertices.",
  "flows": "User data is propagated and duplicated across window parameter objects; geometric data flows into aperture and door creation; offset, flip, and merge operations manipulate polygon vertices and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code performs standard geometric and data handling operations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external system calls are observed. User data is stored and propagated securely without external influence. All data processing follows normal geometric modeling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on defining classes for window parameter modeling with geometric transformations, merging, splitting, and validation functions. All operations involve geometric calculations, data copying, and property management. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, file access, or code injection, are detected. The inclusion of 'user_data' supports metadata attachment but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, suspicious external calls, or manipulation of system resources are present. The logic aligns with architectural modeling purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely geometric and data management related to window modeling. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs standard operations for architectural geometry processing. No security threats or malware are identified.",
