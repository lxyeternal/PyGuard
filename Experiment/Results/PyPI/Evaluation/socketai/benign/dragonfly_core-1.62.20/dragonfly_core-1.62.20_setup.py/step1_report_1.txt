  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'dragonfly-core' Python package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() invocation that registers package details and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setting variables -> passing variables to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md and requirements.txt files to obtain package description and dependencies, then invokes setuptools.setup() with standard package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All operations are typical for package setup scripts. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security concerns identified.",
