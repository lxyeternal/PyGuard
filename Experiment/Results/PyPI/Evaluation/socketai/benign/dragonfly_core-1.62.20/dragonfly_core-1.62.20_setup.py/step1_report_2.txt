  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'dragonfly-core' Python package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' for long description, reads from 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> uses data in setup() function for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No dynamic execution or external network calls present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading files for description and dependencies, configuring package metadata, and defining entry points. It uses 'setuptools' for package configuration, which is typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All file reads are from local files, and no untrusted data is executed or transmitted. The dependencies are loaded from a file, which is standard practice and does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal and secure setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
