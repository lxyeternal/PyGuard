{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'dragonfly-core', responsible for packaging, dependency management, and distribution configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and package metadata from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the script sets up package configuration without executing untrusted code or handling external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reads files (README.md, requirements.txt) → Uses their content in package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard setuptools practices. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading documentation and requirements files, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It includes no code execution beyond file reading, which is typical and safe. No indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a typical, legitimate setup script without any anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and standard in structure.",
