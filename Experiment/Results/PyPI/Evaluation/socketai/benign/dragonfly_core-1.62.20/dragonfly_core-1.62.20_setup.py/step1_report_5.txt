  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'dragonfly-core' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; reading requirements.txt for dependencies; static configuration data within setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or dangerous operations present in this code",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. Usage of open files and static setup parameters is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown file for description and a requirements file for dependencies, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and an entry point for CLI. All file operations are straightforward and read-only, with no user input or external untrusted data handling. The setup configuration appears conventional. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions or handle untrusted data. It appears safe.",
