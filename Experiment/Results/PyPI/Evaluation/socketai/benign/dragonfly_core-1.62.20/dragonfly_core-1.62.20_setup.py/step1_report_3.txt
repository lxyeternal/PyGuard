  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'dragonfly-core' Python package, including reading dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and package discovery via setuptools.find_packages().",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data outputs or external calls.",
  "flows": "N/A - standard setup process; no untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard package setup code. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code reads from static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') for package description and dependencies. Uses 'setuptools.setup' for package configuration, which is standard. No external network calls, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns observed. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's structure and content align with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
