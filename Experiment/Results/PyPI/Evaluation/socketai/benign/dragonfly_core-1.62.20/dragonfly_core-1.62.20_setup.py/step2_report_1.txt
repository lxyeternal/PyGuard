  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- They uniformly conclude no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The code reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and invokes setuptools.setup() with typical parameters.\n- No suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, external network calls, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated code score of 0, and security risk score of 0.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears straightforward, with no anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The operations are limited to file reading and package configuration, which are standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware: 0 — appropriate, as no malicious activity is detected.\n   - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n   - SecurityRisk: 0 — no security concerns identified.\n   \n   These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No such scores are assigned; the code is benign.\n   \n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious intent or activity is present.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard setup script with no security issues. The assigned scores are justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nMaintain current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
