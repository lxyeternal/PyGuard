  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, reading static files for description and dependencies, and defining package metadata and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup process involves static files and local package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading files into variables, then passing parameters to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, involving reading static files and invoking setuptools.setup() with standard parameters. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices justify these scores. No suspicious behavior or security issues are detected, and the code's structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified. No further action or modification is necessary.",
