  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package, reading static files and invoking setuptools.setup() with typical parameters.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscation is also correctly scored as 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which is consistent with the findings.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, external network calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The only potential concern could be dependencies loaded from 'requirements.txt', but this is standard practice and not inherently risky unless the requirements file contains malicious packages, which is outside the scope of this script.\n- The package setup process itself is benign and typical.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score: 0 is appropriate; no security vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and typical for a Python package setup.",
