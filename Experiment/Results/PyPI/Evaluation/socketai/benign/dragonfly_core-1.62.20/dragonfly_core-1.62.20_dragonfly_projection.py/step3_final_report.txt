  "purpose": "Utilities for converting X,Y coordinates in meters to longitude, latitude and vice versa, based on standard geographic formulas.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as origin longitude/latitude, polygon coordinate arrays, and location objects; internal calculations using mathematical formulas.",
  "sinks": "Computed longitude/latitude arrays, coordinate transformations; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates, origin points) are processed through mathematical formulas to produce transformed geographic coordinates; no external data flows or external system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward implementation of standard formulas.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geographic coordinate transformations based on well-known formulas, with no external system interactions or malicious behaviors. Functions are self-contained, performing calculations for meters-to-longitude/latitude conversions and vice versa. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies solely on mathematical operations. No hardcoded secrets or external dependencies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for geographic coordinate transformations. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk near zero—are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
