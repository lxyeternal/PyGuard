{
  "purpose": "Provide utilities for converting between meters and geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude) for polygon and point data, primarily for spatial analysis.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data from untrusted sources; it primarily processes provided coordinate data and parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs coordinate transformations but does not include any network, file I/O, or other data sinks that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input polygons or points are converted to longitude/latitude or meters using mathematical formulas; no external untrusted data flows into the system in a way that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, performing mathematical transformations. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is evident. All functions serve typical spatial conversion purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of spatial conversion functions based on well-known geographic formulas, with appropriate parameter handling and fallback calculations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions rely on mathematical transformations using constants related to Earth's radius and standard geographic calculations. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected. The code is well-structured, clear, and performs expected operations without side effects or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard spatial coordinate transformation utilities without any malicious or suspicious features. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears safe for use in geographic or spatial analysis workflows.",
