{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for converting geographic coordinates between meters and longitude/latitude, and for transforming polygons and scene origins based on these conversions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: 'origin_lon_lat', 'polygon', 'location', and 'point'. Uses fixed constants for Earth radii.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations and returns coordinate transformations; no explicit data sinks or external network operations.",
  "flows": "Calculates conversion factors from Earth radii, then applies these factors to convert coordinate arrays in functions like 'polygon_to_lon_lat', 'lon_lat_to_polygon', and 'origin_long_lat_from_location'. No external data flow or untrusted data execution is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses straightforward mathematical calculations for coordinate conversions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geographic coordinate conversions based on well-known formulas and constants. It includes functions for converting between meters and degrees, transforming polygons, and calculating origin points. All operations are mathematical and data-driven, with no external system calls, network activity, or data leaks. No signs of malicious intent, suspicious anomalies, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for geographic coordinate transformations, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows typical mathematical procedures for such conversions and does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
