  "purpose": "Utilities for converting geographic coordinates between meters and longitude/latitude, including polygon transformations and origin calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments: 'polygon' (coordinate arrays), 'origin_lon_lat', 'conversion_factors', 'location' object, and 'point'.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations and returns transformed coordinate arrays; no direct data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates, origin points) flows into conversion functions, which process and produce transformed coordinate data. No untrusted external data sources or sinks are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No suspicious external network activity, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The code uses straightforward mathematical formulas for coordinate transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides coordinate transformation functions based on standard geographic formulas. It relies solely on mathematical calculations involving Earth's radius and trigonometry, with no external network operations, file I/O, or system commands. The use of optional parameters for conversion factors and the handling of coordinate systems appear standard and safe. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The functions are self-contained and use common Python math libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of legitimate geographic utility functions with no malicious intent. It is well-structured, and there are no indicators of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. Overall security risk is minimal.",
