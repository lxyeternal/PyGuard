  "purpose": "Utilities for converting between meter-based coordinate systems and geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude), including polygon transformations and origin calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as polygons, locations, points, and origin coordinates.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations only; it does not write data or send it over the network, nor does it execute system commands or handle untrusted external data sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (polygon coordinates, location objects, points, origin coordinates) through conversion functions that compute geographic or meter-based coordinates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code uses mathematical formulas for coordinate transformations without obfuscation. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides geographic coordinate transformation functions based on well-known formulas, with no evidence of malicious intent. It does not interact with external systems, store or transmit data, or include suspicious code segments. The use of mathematical conversions is standard for geographic computations. The functions accept parameters for input data and perform straightforward calculations for coordinate conversions and origin determination. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for geographic coordinate transformations. It follows standard mathematical procedures without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within this code segment.",
