  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific building geometry class with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The detailed analysis and scoring from the reports are accurate and appropriate. The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting standard boundary condition handling. The confidence level is high (~0.95). No logical flaws or suspicious activity are evident. The code is safe for use in building modeling contexts, with input validation recommended to prevent misuse but no inherent security concerns."
