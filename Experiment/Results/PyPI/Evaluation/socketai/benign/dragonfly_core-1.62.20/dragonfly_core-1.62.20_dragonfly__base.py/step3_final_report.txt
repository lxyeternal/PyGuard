  "purpose": "A base class for all geometry objects, providing validation, property management, error reporting, and utility functions for geometry data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for identifiers, display names, user data, and geometry properties; validation functions like valid_string.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution; internal error reporting and data management only.",
  "flows": "Validation of identifier -> setting properties -> error message generation -> geometry calculations (min/max points).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' in user_data setter; no other unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured base class for geometry objects. It performs validation, manages properties, provides error reporting, and includes utility functions for geometry calculations. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The only minor concern is the use of 'assert' in the user_data setter, which is a common Python pattern but can be disabled in optimized runs. The validation function 'valid_string' is external but assumed safe. Overall, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2 are appropriate. The minor 'assert' concern does not significantly impact security. Overall, it is a safe and standard implementation.",
