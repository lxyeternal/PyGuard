{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for geometry objects with properties, validation, and utility methods.",
  "sources": "Input is primarily through constructor argument 'identifier' and optional 'user_data' set via property.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if 'user_data' contains sensitive info; no explicit sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor ('identifier') and 'user_data' setter to class properties; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of unsafe eval or dynamic code execution. The code appears standard for a geometric base class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with properties, validation, and utility functions for geometry objects. It includes input validation, property management, and error message construction. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscated patterns observed. The 'user_data' attribute allows arbitrary dicts, but this is standard and not inherently malicious. The functions '_calculate_min' and '_calculate_max' process geometry data internally. No external data is fetched or sent. No suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, well-structured base class for geometry objects without malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident. It does not perform any external operations or contain hidden malicious logic.",
