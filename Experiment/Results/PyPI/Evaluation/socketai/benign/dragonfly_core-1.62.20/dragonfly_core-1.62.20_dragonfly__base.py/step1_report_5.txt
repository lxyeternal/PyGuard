  "purpose": "Define a base class for geometry objects with validation, properties, and utility methods.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'identifier', 'display_name', and 'user_data' parameters; also class properties and methods accessing object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are property setters (e.g., 'identifier', 'user_data') where external input is assigned, and methods that manipulate or serialize object data, such as '__copy__' and 'ToString'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('identifier', 'value' in setters) into object properties, possibly passing through validation ('valid_string') and assertions, then to output or serialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. Use of assertions in 'user_data' setter for type checking is standard. No unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class with properties, validation, and utility methods. 'identifier' is validated with 'valid_string'. The 'user_data' setter enforces type safety with an assertion. Methods for copying and string representation are straightforward. No code that performs network operations, file modifications, or system commands. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution present. The validation message method handles error reporting, and min/max calculation methods operate on geometry objects, all of which seem benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured base class for geometry objects with input validation and utility functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears safe with no security risks identified.",
