It functions as a geometric modeling utility for shading elements, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The high security risk scores in the original reports are conservative but justified given external face interactions, which could be manipulated if face objects are compromised. Overall, supply chain security risk is negligible."

The detailed analysis and scoring from the reports are accurate and appropriate. The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting standard boundary condition handling. The confidence level is high (~0.95). No logical flaws or suspicious activity are evident. The code is safe for use in building modeling contexts, with input validation recommended to prevent misuse but no inherent security concerns."
