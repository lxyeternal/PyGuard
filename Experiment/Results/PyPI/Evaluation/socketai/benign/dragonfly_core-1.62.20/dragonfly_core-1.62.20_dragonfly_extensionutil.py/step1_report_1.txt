  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting and organizing extension property dictionaries from a model data structure related to honeybee-core.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input dictionaries: 'data', 'building_list', 'story_list', 'room2d_list', 'context_shade_list'. These are passed as arguments to functions and are the primary data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the lists: 'building_ext_dicts', 'story_ext_dicts', 'room2d_ext_dicts', 'context_shade_ext_dicts'. These are output lists collecting extension property dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries ('data', 'building_list', etc.) through the functions, with extraction of 'properties' using 'extension_key', and appending to output lists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; functions handle missing keys gracefully by appending None, standard for data extraction. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward extraction of extension property dictionaries from nested data structures. It uses assertions and try-except blocks to handle missing keys. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscation are present. The functions are well-structured and do not contain malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data leaks are evident. The code's purpose is purely data organization without any side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for organizing model extension data; it appears benign and serves standard data processing roles without malicious intent or security risks.",
