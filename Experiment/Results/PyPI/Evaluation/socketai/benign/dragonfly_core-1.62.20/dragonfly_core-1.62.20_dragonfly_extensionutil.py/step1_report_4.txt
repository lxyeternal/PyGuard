  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting extension property dictionaries from a complex hierarchical model data structure, mainly used for organizing model data by geometry types.",
  "sources": "Data input is from function parameters, specifically the 'data' dictionary representing the entire model, and various lists of dictionaries (buildings, stories, room2ds, context_shades).",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network operations, file I/O, or system calls. The code primarily reads from input data structures and appends to provided lists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures through try-except blocks into the output lists; no untrusted data flows into system or external interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. Functions perform straightforward data extraction with exception handling for missing keys. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of multiple functions that extract nested extension property dictionaries from a hierarchical model structure. It performs type assertions, iterates through lists of dictionaries, and appends relevant extension data to output lists, handling missing keys gracefully. No network operations, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to serve a data organization purpose without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as a utility for organizing and extracting model extension data. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is straightforward and safe for use.",
