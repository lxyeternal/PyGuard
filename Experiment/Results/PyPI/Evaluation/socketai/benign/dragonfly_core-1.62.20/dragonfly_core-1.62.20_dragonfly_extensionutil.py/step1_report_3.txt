{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for extracting extension property dictionaries from a model data structure, organized by geometry type, for use in different parts of a larger building simulation or analysis system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input dictionaries, specifically from keys such as 'type', 'buildings', 'context_shades', and nested properties within these structures.",
  "sinks": "The data is appended to lists within the functions, with no apparent direct use of untrusted data in a vulnerable manner such as executing code, writing files, or sending network requests.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from specified dictionary keys; extension property dictionaries are extracted and stored in lists; no data is forwarded to external systems or sinks beyond local collection.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs assertions and exception handling for missing keys but contains no suspicious or unusual logic such as code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions are structured to traverse nested dictionaries and lists, extracting specified extension properties. They rely on standard dictionary access patterns with exception handling for missing keys, which is common in data processing. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be purely utility functions for data extraction with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe utility functions for extracting extension data from a structured model representation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a straightforward data processing module with no evident security concerns.",
