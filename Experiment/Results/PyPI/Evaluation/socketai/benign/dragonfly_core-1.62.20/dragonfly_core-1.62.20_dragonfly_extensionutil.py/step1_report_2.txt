  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting extension property dictionaries from a model data structure, organizing them by geometry type and extension key.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input dictionary 'data', including 'buildings', 'context_shades', 'unique_stories', 'room_2ds', and their 'properties' fields.",
  "sinks": "Appends data to provided lists such as 'building_ext_dicts', 'story_ext_dicts', 'room2d_ext_dicts', 'context_shade_ext_dicts' after attempting to access nested 'properties' with a given extension key.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through try-except blocks where 'properties'[extension_key] is accessed, then appended to lists; no external output or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. Functions perform straightforward data extraction. Use of try-except is standard; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard data extraction routines with clear logic: it iterates over model components, attempts to retrieve extension-specific properties, and appends results to lists. Exception handling is used to handle missing keys gracefully. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling detected. The overall structure is consistent with typical data processing functions, and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for data extraction from a structured model representation. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It performs straightforward data access and list appending with standard exception handling.",
