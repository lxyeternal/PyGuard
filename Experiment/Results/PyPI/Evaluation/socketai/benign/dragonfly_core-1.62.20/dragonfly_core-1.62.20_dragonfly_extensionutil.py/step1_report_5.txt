  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting extension property dictionaries from a model data structure, organized by geometry type.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input dictionaries: 'data', 'building_list', 'story_list', 'room2d_list', 'context_shade_list'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly lead to data leaks, external communications, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through list iterations and property extraction, mainly appending to provided lists. No untrusted data is processed insecurely or forwarded externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors. The code performs straightforward data extraction with exception handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The functions operate solely on provided data structures, extracting nested properties based on specified keys. Exception handling ensures robustness when keys are missing. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or system commands. It does not include or invoke any potentially malicious modules or functions. The structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no indications of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for organizing and extracting extension property dictionaries from a model data structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely on input data without external effects.",
