  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting extension property dictionaries from a hierarchical building model data structure, organizing data by geometry type.",
  "sources": "Reads from nested dictionaries within the model data structure, accessing 'properties' keys and handling missing keys gracefully.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs; purely data extraction within in-memory structures.",
  "flows": "Source: Accessing 'properties' keys in nested dictionaries; Sink: Appending to provided lists; Flow: Data read from model dicts to output lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward extraction of nested dictionaries with exception handling for missing keys. It does not execute dynamic code, access network, or modify files. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The functions are utility in nature, designed for data access and organization, with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs safe data extraction. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
