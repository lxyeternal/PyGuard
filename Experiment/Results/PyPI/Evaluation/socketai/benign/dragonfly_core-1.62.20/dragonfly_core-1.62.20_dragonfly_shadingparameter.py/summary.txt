  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. It functions as a geometric modeling utility for shading elements, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The high security risk scores in the original reports are conservative but justified given external face interactions, which could be manipulated if face objects are compromised. Overall, supply chain security risk is negligible."
