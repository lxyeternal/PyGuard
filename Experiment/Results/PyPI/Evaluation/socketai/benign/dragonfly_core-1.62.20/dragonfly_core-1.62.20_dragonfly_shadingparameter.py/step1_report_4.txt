{
  "purpose": "Define classes and methods for shading parameters in a building simulation framework, including extruded borders, overhangs, and louvers, with capabilities for serialization, copying, and scaling.",
  "sources": "None (no input or external data reading functions); data is passed via method arguments and dictionaries for object creation.",
  "sinks": "None directly; methods generate objects or modify face geometries via external face methods such as 'ap.extruded_border', 'face.overhang', 'face.louvers_by_distance', and 'face.louvers_by_count'.",
  "flows": "Data flows mainly in object creation via 'from_dict' methods and geometric modification via 'add_shading_to_face' methods calling external face object methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code performs geometric calculations and object manipulations consistent with its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of shading parameter classes for building models, with methods for serialization, copying, scaling, and applying shading features to face objects. Usage of assertions ensures data correctness. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. All methods operate within expected geometric and data handling patterns. No malware, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of shading parameter classes for a building simulation library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard Python practices for data handling and geometric modifications. The code is safe for use and has no indications of supply chain or malware concerns.",
