{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manipulate HEIC image files by removing the first image in a HEIC file and saving the result in a designated folder.",
  "sources": "The code reads a specific HEIC image file from 'images/heif/zPug_3.heic' using pillow_heif.open_heif.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the modified HEIC image to the 'tests/../converted' directory with the same filename stem but as a new HEIC file.",
  "flows": "Input source: reading 'zPug_3.heic' -> process: removing the first image from the HEIF object -> output sink: saving the modified HEIC file in the target directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs straightforward image file manipulation. No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory to a 'tests' folder relative to the script location. It creates a target directory if it does not exist. It then loads a HEIC image using pillow_heif, deletes the first image in the collection, and saves the modified image back to a specified folder. All operations are standard file and image manipulations with no embedded or obfuscated malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate image processing tasks without any malicious intent or security concerns. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
