  "purpose": "The code loads a HEIC/HEIF image, deletes the first image/frame in the container, and saves the modified image to a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the image file 'images/heif/zPug_3.heic' using pillow_heif.open_heif()",
  "sinks": "Saving the modified image to the target directory with heif_image.save()",
  "flows": "Source: reading the image file -> deletion of the first frame in heif_image -> sink: saving the modified image",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del heif_image[0]' to remove an image/frame from the HEIF container; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward image processing: setting working directory, ensuring target directory exists, opening a HEIF image, removing the first image/frame, and saving the result. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present. The deletion operation is standard for image manipulation. The code's behavior aligns with typical image processing tasks, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard image container manipulation without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor security considerations are typical for file handling and do not constitute a security risk.",
