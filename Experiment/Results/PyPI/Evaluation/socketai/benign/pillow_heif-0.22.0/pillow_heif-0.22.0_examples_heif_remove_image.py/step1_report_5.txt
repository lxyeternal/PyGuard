  "purpose": "Process a HEIC image file by removing the first image from a multi-image HEIF file and saving the modified image to a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'images/heif/zPug_3.heic' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Saves the modified HEIF file to the 'converted' directory.",
  "flows": "Reads the HEIF image from disk (source), modifies it in memory, then writes the result back to disk (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded paths are present but typical for a script; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script changes working directories to a 'tests' folder, then processes a specific HEIF image by opening it with pillow_heif, deletes the first image in the container, and saves the result. The code uses standard library functions and a common image processing library without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No data leakage, no network activity, no code injection or backdoors are present. It appears to be a straightforward image processing script intended for testing or batch processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple image file manipulation without any malicious intent or security risks. No malware or suspicious activities are detected. The script's functionality is limited to image processing tasks, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
