{
  "purpose": "The code processes HEIF images by removing the first image from a specific HEIC file and saving the result to a target directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file 'images/heif/zPug_3.heic' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code saves the modified HEIF image to the 'converted' directory, writing to the filesystem.",
  "flows": "The code reads the HEIC file from disk (source) and then saves the modified image back to disk (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of 'pillow_heif' library appears standard for image processing. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code changes the working directory relative to script location, which is typical. No external network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script sets its working directory relative to its location, then creates a target folder if it doesn't exist. It loads a HEIF image file, deletes the first image in the sequence, and saves the modified image. The use of 'pillow_heif' is appropriate for HEIF processing. No suspicious logic, network activity, or obfuscated code. The flow is straightforward: read from disk, modify data, save to disk. No hardcoded secrets or potential injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate image processing tasks without any signs of malicious behavior. It neither exfiltrates data nor executes any harmful operations. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
