{
  "purpose": "The code loads a HEIC image, removes the first image from it, and saves the modified image to a specified directory.",
  "sources": "The input source is the file 'images/heif/zPug_3.heic' read via pillow_heif.open_heif.",
  "sinks": "The output sink is the file path specified by 'result_path' where the modified image is saved.",
  "flows": "The code reads the HEIC image file, processes it in memory, and then writes the modified image to disk at the target location.",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies an image by deleting an element from a HEIF container, but the manipulation appears to be straightforward image processing without suspicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script sets the working directory, defines a target folder, loads a HEIF image, removes the first image from the HEIF container, and saves the resulting image to a designated directory. The operations involve standard library functions and third-party library usage for image handling. There are no network operations, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to perform typical image processing tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate image manipulation without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads and writes image files in a straightforward manner, with no evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious actions.",
