{
  "purpose": "The code processes HEIF images by removing the first image from a HEIF file and saving the modified file to a target directory.",
  "sources": "Reads the file at 'images/heif/zPug_3.heic' using pillow_heif.open_heif().",
  "sinks": "Saves the modified HEIF image to the specified output path in the 'converted' folder.",
  "flows": "Reads the input HEIF file, modifies the image list by deleting the first element, then saves the modified image to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of 'del heif_image[0]' is standard manipulation of the image list.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the working directory relative to the script's location, opens a specific HEIF image file, deletes the first image from its internal list, and saves the result. All operations are standard image processing steps. No network activity, no data exfiltration, or suspicious file handling observed. The use of pillow_heif appears appropriate for handling HEIF images. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs straightforward image manipulation without any malicious intent or security concerns. It processes a HEIF image by removing its first frame and saves the modified image locally. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
