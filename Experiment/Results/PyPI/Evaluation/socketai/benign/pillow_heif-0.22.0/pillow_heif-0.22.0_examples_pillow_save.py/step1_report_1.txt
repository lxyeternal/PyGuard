  "purpose": "Convert a GIF image to HEIC format as part of a demo or test script.",
  "sources": "Reading the image file from 'images/non_heif/chi.gif'.",
  "sinks": "Saving the converted HEIC image to the 'converted' directory.",
  "flows": "Image is opened from the source path and then saved as a HEIC file in the target directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard image processing libraries. No network activity, environment variable misuse, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script changes directory to a 'tests' folder relative to the script's location. It imports necessary libraries, registers HEIF support with pillow_heif, creates a target directory, opens a GIF image, and saves it as a HEIC file with quality=50. The process appears straightforward and intended for image format conversion. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injection are present. All operations involve standard library calls for image processing and file handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple image conversion script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard file I/O and image processing tasks without suspicious behavior or malicious code. No security concerns are evident.",
