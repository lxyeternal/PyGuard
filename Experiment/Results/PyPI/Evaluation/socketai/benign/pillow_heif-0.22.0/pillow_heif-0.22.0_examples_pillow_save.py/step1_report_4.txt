  "purpose": "Convert a GIF image to HEIC format in a specified target directory.",
  "sources": "Reading the GIF image from 'images/non_heif/chi.gif' via Image.open()",
  "sinks": "Saving the converted image to the 'converted' directory with img.save()",
  "flows": "Image.open() reads the GIF file -> pillow_heif.register_heif_opener() enables HEIC support -> img.save() writes HEIC file to target directory",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of standard libraries and a legitimate image processing workflow.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the working directory relative to its location, then creates a 'converted' directory if it doesn't exist. It registers the HEIF format support, loads a GIF image, and saves it as a HEIC file with quality settings. The process is straightforward image conversion without any network activity, data leakage, or obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a typical image format conversion with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for image processing.",
