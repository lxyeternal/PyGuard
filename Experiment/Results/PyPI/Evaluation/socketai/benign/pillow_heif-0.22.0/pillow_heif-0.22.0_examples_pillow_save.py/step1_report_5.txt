  "purpose": "Convert a GIF image to HEIC format using pillow and pillow_heif libraries.",
  "sources": "Reading the image file from a specified path ('images/non_heif/chi.gif')",
  "sinks": "Saving the converted image to the target directory ('../converted')",
  "flows": "Image file is read from disk and then saved as a HEIC file in a different directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The script sets the working directory relative to its location, registers the HEIF opener, creates output directory if not existing, opens a GIF image, converts and saves it as HEIC with specified quality, then closes the image. No untrusted input handling or network activity. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image format conversion script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
