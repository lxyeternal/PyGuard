  "purpose": "Convert a GIF image to HEIC format and save it to a specified folder.",
  "sources": "Reads image file from 'images/non_heif/chi.gif' and current working directory context.",
  "sinks": "Writes the converted HEIC image to the 'converted' folder.",
  "flows": "Reads image from the source path, processes it using PIL, and saves it to the target folder.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and a legitimate image processing library.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory to a parent directory, registers the HEIF opener, creates a target folder if needed, and converts a specific GIF image to HEIC format. The process appears straightforward without any obfuscated code or malicious behavior. No network activity, no sensitive data handling, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple image format conversion without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility script for image processing.",
