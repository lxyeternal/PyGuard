  "purpose": "Convert a GIF image to HEIC format using pillow and pillow_heif libraries.",
  "sources": "Reading image file from 'images/non_heif/chi.gif' using Image.open()",
  "sinks": "Saving the converted HEIC image to '../converted' directory",
  "flows": "Image file read from source path, processed, and saved to target directory",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded credentials. Usage of well-known libraries for image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code changes the working directory to a parent 'tests' folder, registers the HEIF opener, creates a target directory if it doesn't exist, then opens a GIF image and saves it as a HEIC image with specified quality. The libraries used are standard for image conversion, and no untrusted input processing or insecure operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a standard image conversion task with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses established libraries appropriately and does not contain suspicious code behaviors.",
