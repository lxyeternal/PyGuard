{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load and display HEIF images from a specified file path for testing or viewing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads a specific image file at 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' using pillow_heif.open_heif.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the 'show()' method on Pillow images, which can invoke external image viewers, but does not process untrusted input in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "The code reads the image file ('sources') and then displays each image in a viewer ('sinks'), with no data flowing from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The image path is hardcoded and relative, which could lead to unexpected files being loaded if the directory structure changes, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory to a 'tests' directory relative to its location, then loads a specific HEIF image file using 'pillow_heif'. It prints the number of images contained in the HEIF file and displays each image using the default image viewer. There is no user input or untrusted data handling beyond loading a predefined file. The use of 'show()' could invoke external viewers, but this is standard behavior for image display. No suspicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code appears to be intended for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign image loading and display functions without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors.",
