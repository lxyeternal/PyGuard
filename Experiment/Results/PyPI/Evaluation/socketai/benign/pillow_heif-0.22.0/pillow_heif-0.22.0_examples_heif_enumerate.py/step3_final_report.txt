{
  "purpose": "The code loads a specific HEIF/HEIC image file from a local path, converts it to PIL images, and displays each image using the default viewer.",
  "sources": "Reads the image file at 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' via pillow_heif.open_heif()",
  "sinks": "Displays images using _img.show(), which invokes external image viewers",
  "flows": "Source: open_heif() reads the file; flow proceeds to converting images to PIL; sink: _img.show() displays images",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded relative path; changes working directory to 'tests'; no input validation or untrusted data handling; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward image viewer/test utility. It loads a specific HEIF image, prints the number of images contained, and displays each image. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution occurs. The use of _img.show() may invoke external viewers, but this is standard for image display scripts. The hardcoded path and directory change are typical in testing contexts but could be considered minor security considerations. Overall, the code exhibits no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the logic is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a local image viewer for HEIF images. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.05) are appropriate. Minor risk from external viewer invocation is acceptable in this context.",
