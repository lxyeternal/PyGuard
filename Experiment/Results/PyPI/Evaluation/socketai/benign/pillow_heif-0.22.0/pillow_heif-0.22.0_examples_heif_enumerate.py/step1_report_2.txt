{
  "purpose": "The code loads and displays images from a specified HEIC file, primarily for demonstration or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads a specific image file at 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' using pillow_heif.open_heif.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the 'show' method on PIL Image objects, which may invoke an external viewer application to display images.",
  "flows": "Source: reading the HEIC image file -> Processing with pillow_heif -> Conversion to PIL images -> Display using _img.show()",
  "anomalies": "The code changes the working directory to a 'tests' directory relative to the script's location; it only processes a single specific image file without user input or validation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets the working directory relative to its location, then loads a specific HEIC image file with pillow_heif. It prints the number of images contained within the file, then iterates over each image, converting it to a Pillow image object and displaying it. The use of pillow_heif and PIL's show method is standard for image processing. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is observed. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a simple image viewer demo, with no suspicious or malicious actions involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image loading and display script with no malicious intent. It operates locally, processes a specific image file, and displays images without any suspicious or harmful behavior. There are no security risks or malware detected.",
