{
  "purpose": "The code displays images from a specified HEIF file by converting them to Pillow images and showing them.",
  "sources": "The code reads a specific image file located at 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic'.",
  "sinks": "The '_img.show()' method displays images, which could potentially invoke system viewers. However, this is standard behavior for image display.",
  "flows": "Image file path is read from a hardcoded location; the image is loaded via 'pillow_heif.open_heif'; images are converted and displayed using '_img.show()'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The code merely processes and displays an image file. No dynamic code execution or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script changes working directory relative to the script's location, then loads a specific HEIF image file. It uses 'pillow_heif' to open and process the image, then displays each image in the file. No untrusted input handling, no network activity, no obfuscated or malicious code observed. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple image display utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It relies on static file paths and standard library functions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
