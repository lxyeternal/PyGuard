{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to open and display HEIF/HEIC images from a specific file path for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads a file path 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' using the Path object and pillow_heif.open_heif to load the image data.",
  "sinks": "Calls image.to_pillow() and _img.show(), which display images, potentially exposing image data, but do not transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Image file path is read and passed to open_heif, which processes the file; the resulting images are converted to PIL images and displayed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious file paths, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard libraries and image processing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the working directory based on the script location, then loads and displays a HEIF image file from a specified relative path. It leverages the pillow_heif library for decoding HEIF images. The display function _img.show() is used for visualization, which is common in testing scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign demonstration or test of the pillow_heif library for handling HEIF images. It performs standard file reading, image decoding, and display operations without malicious intent or security risks.",
