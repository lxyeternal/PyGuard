{
  "purpose": "The code loads and displays HEIF images from a specified file path for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads a file specified by 'image_path', which is a local file path within the project directory.",
  "sinks": "The code uses the 'show' method on PIL Image objects, which displays images using the default image viewer. No network or data leakage occurs.",
  "flows": "The image file is loaded via 'pillow_heif.open_heif' from a trusted local path, then converted to PIL images and displayed locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform any insecure operations.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory to a 'tests' folder, then loads a specific HEIF image file using 'pillow_heif'. It prints the number of images in the file and displays each image locally. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and a third-party package to process images. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple image viewer for HEIF images within a test environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The functionality is limited to local file reading and image display.",
