{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to build a Python extension module for Pillow-Heif, primarily handling configuration, dependency checks, and compilation setup.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., PATH, PKG_CONFIG, CFLAGS, INCLUDE), reads version info from '_version.py', reads filesystem (e.g., checking for files and directories), executes subprocesses (e.g., 'brew', 'xcrun'), reads text files (e.g., '_version.py')",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocesses ('subprocess.check_output'), filesystem access ('os.path', 'os.access'), environment variables influencing build process, copying files ('copy')",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system commands influence directory and dependency configuration, subprocess outputs determine include/library directories, filesystem checks locate headers and libraries, subprocess calls gather system info, and copying files adjusts library files for Windows",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity present. Use of subprocess for system info is standard but could be misused if malicious commands were injected, though none are found here. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency detection, environment setup, and compilation configuration without executing any suspicious or malicious actions. It reads system info, environment variables, and filesystem status to configure build environment. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification actions are detected. The subprocess calls are standard for cross-platform build setups, and there are no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python extension, with no malicious behavior detected. It performs dependency checks, configures build environment, and manages files as expected for a build process. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious intent are apparent.",
