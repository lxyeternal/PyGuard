{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to build and compile the Pillow-Heif Python extension, handling dependencies and platform-specific configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads input and environment variables from os.environ, subprocess outputs, file contents (e.g., _version.py), and user-specified paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to invoke system commands, modifies extension build parameters, copies files, and accesses environment variables related to compiler and linker flags.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and user inputs influence configuration settings; subprocess outputs inform directory and dependency detection; file reading guides version info; build extension parameters are set based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code segments, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The code performs standard build configuration tasks with platform-specific handling and environment checks.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles dependency detection, platform-specific configuration, and environment variable parsing for building C extensions. All subprocess calls appear intended for configuration, not malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, network communication, or obfuscated code are present. File operations are limited to copying known library files and reading version info. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build setup for a Python extension module, with comprehensive environment and dependency handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. It appears to be a standard, well-structured build script without malicious signals.",
