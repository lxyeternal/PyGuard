  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script builds the extension, reads version info, environment variables, and system files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for configuration, file copying, environment variables for build parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess calls are standard for build scripts, and no data leaks or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build process, dependency handling, environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for system tools, copies DLLs, manages build parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Copying DLLs is typical in build scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard build setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (still low)\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Dependency detection, environment parsing, subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variables influence build configuration; subprocess calls for system info.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard tools.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical build script, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, dependency management, environment detection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for system info, filesystem checks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious payloads or obfuscation. Standard build environment setup.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build configuration, dependency detection, environment variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess, filesystem checks, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious commands. Uses standard subprocess calls.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical build script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n**Assessment:** Clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the analysis confirms no malicious behavior. The script performs environment detection, dependency management, and file operations typical of build scripts.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern about environment complexity, but no real security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, standard build logic.\n- **Risk:** **0.1-0.2** — very low, primarily due to environment complexity and subprocess usage, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the inherent complexity but no actual threat)\n\nThis build script is a standard, well-structured setup process with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
