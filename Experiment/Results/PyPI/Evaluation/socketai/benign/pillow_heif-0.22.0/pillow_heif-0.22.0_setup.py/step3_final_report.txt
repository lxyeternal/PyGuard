  "purpose": "Build setup script for the Pillow-Heif Python extension, managing dependencies, platform-specific configurations, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py', environment variables (e.g., PKG_CONFIG, CFLAGS, INCLUDE), runs subprocesses for system info and SDK paths, copies DLL files during Windows build.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls for system configuration, file copying of DLLs, environment variables influencing build parameters.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (version file, environment variables, subprocess outputs) influence build configuration and file operations; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. File copying of DLLs is standard in build processes. No network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard, platform-aware build configuration for a Python extension module. It uses subprocesses to detect SDK paths and dependencies, manages environment variables for build parameters, and copies known library files as part of the build process. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for such build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build setup script with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. All signals indicate a safe, standard process for building the extension module.",
