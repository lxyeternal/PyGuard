  "purpose": "The script is designed to build a Python extension module for pillow_heif, handling dependencies and environment configuration for different platforms.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., PKG_CONFIG, CFLAGS, INCLUDE paths), reads _version.py for version info, reads filesystem for include and library directories, and executes subprocess commands (brew, xcrun).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands (pkg-config, brew, xcrun), filesystem access (checking and copying library files), environment variables influencing build configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence include and library paths; filesystem checks influence build steps; environment variables like PKG_CONFIG, CFLAGS, and others influence directory inclusion; subprocess commands determine SDK paths and library locations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of subprocess calls to system tools is standard for build scripts. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected. The script dynamically finds dependencies and configures build environment in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build configuration script that manages dependencies, paths, and compilation settings for building a Python extension. It performs environment checks, filesystem checks, and subprocess calls to system tools such as pkg-config, brew, and xcrun. All subprocess commands are standard for such build environments, and no suspicious or malicious activity (like data exfiltration, network communications, or hidden backdoors) is evident. The code does not contain any malicious code injections or obfuscated patterns. Its behavior aligns with legitimate package build procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a build configuration tool for a Python extension module, managing dependencies and environment setup across platforms. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code appears standard for a build process and does not pose security threats.",
