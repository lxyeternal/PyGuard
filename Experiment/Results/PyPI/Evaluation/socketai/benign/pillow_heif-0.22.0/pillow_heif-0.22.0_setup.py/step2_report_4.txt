  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard build setup for Pillow-Heif, handling dependencies, platform-specific configurations, and environment variables. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Code presence:** The code reads version info, environment variables, runs subprocesses for system info, copies files, and sets build parameters. All are typical for a build script.\n\n- **Malicious indicators:** No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code. File copying is limited to known library files, with validation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low). These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dependency detection, environment handling, and platform-specific configuration. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Code presence:** Same as above; subprocess calls, environment variable parsing, file operations.\n\n- **Malicious indicators:** No backdoors or malicious payloads. DLL copying is part of build process, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Slightly higher but still low, considering the complexity.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a build script managing dependencies, environment variables, and platform-specific setup. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Code presence:** Similar subprocess calls, environment parsing, filesystem checks.\n\n- **Malicious indicators:** No signs of malicious intent. Use of subprocess for system tools is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—build configuration, dependency detection, environment handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Code presence:** Similar subprocess calls, environment variables, filesystem checks.\n\n- **Malicious indicators:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard build script, dependency detection, environment setup, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Code presence:** Uses subprocess, environment variables, filesystem access, all typical.\n\n- **Malicious indicators:** None detected. No network activity, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is a typical build script with no malicious payloads or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0.1-0.2, reflecting the minimal security concern of a build script.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is standard, platform-aware build configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical build script risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate; the code is safe and legitimate.",
