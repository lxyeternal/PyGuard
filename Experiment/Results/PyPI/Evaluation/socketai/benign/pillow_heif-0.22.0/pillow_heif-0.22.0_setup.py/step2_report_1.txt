  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code quality, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the script is a legitimate build setup, handling dependencies and platform-specific configurations. It notes no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard build script with no signs of malicious behavior. The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the nature of the script, which interacts with system tools and copies known library files. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency management, platform-specific setup, and no malicious intent. The only slight concern is copying DLL files without validation, but this is typical in build scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk (0.2) accounts for the DLL copying step, but overall, no malicious activity is evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on dependency detection and environment handling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The use of subprocess calls and environment variables is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is justified. The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed dependency management and platform-specific configurations. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score reflects the use of subprocess calls and environment variable parsing, but these are standard for build scripts. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report explicitly states the script is a standard build setup, with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n- **Assessment:** The zero security risk score is justified given the straightforward nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None detected in any report. All interactions are typical for build scripts, involving dependency detection, environment configuration, and file copying.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** All reports appropriately assign low or zero malware and security risk scores, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High confidence (0.9 or 1) is justified based on the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** for all reports — no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** for all reports — code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the analysis, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate, as the script performs typical build configuration tasks without any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the script as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and with minimal security risk. The script is a standard build setup for a Python extension, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
