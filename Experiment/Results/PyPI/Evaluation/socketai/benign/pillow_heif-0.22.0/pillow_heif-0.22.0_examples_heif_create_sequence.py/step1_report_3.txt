  "purpose": "Convert PNG images to a HEIF (.heic) format and save the result.",
  "sources": "Reading image files from the 'images/non_heif' directory using PIL.Image.open.",
  "sinks": "Saving the HEIF file to the 'converted' directory using pillow_heif's save method.",
  "flows": "Image files are loaded from disk (source), processed with pillow_heif, and then saved to disk (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code changes working directories, loads PNG images, converts them to HEIF format, and saves the result. Usage of standard libraries (os, pathlib, PIL) and the pillow_heif library does not indicate malicious intent. The conversion process appears straightforward. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code performs typical image format conversion without any obfuscated or malicious code. No input validation issues or insecure handling of data are evident. It appears to be a benign image processing script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign image format conversion tool with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
