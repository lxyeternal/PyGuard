{
  "purpose": "The code converts PNG images to a HEIF/HEIC format using pillow_heif library, possibly for image processing or format conversion tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from the 'images/non_heif/' directory, specifically 'RGB_8__29x100.png' and 'RGBA_8__128x128.png'.",
  "sinks": "Writes a HEIF file 'RGB_A_8.heic' into the target folder, involving potentially untrusted image data being processed and saved in a new format.",
  "flows": "Image files are read from disk (source), processed with pillow_heif, and then saved as a HEIF file (sink). The flow involves reading local files, converting, and writing output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. Use of image processing libraries and file paths appear standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The script sets the working directory, ensures output directory exists, loads PNG images, converts them to HEIF format using pillow_heif, and saves the result. The process appears to be a straightforward image format conversion. No inputs are taken from untrusted sources such as user input or network. No suspicious code constructs, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard image format conversion without any malicious behavior. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network activity. No indicators of malware or security risks are detected.",
