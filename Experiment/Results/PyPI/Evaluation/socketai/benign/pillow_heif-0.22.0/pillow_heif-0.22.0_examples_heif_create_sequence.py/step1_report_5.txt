{
  "purpose": "The code converts PNG images to a HEIF/HEIC format file containing multiple images.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from the filesystem (`images/non_heif/...`) and the current script's directory for path resolution.",
  "sinks": "Saves the resulting HEIF file to a specified directory (`TARGET_FOLDER`).",
  "flows": "Reads images from disk, processes them into a HEIF container, then writes the HEIF file to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Uses `pillow_heif` to handle images; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity or suspicious behavior. Path manipulations appear standard. No suspicious inputs or outputs identified.",
  "analysis": "The script changes directory to a 'tests' folder, loads two images, and creates a HEIF file combining these images using `pillow_heif`. The process involves standard image reading and file writing operations with no apparent malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network communication are present. The code appears to be a straightforward image processing task intended for testing or conversion purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard image conversion without any malicious behavior or security risks. It reads images and writes a HEIF file locally, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
