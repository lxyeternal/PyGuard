  "purpose": "Convert PNG images to HEIF format by combining two images into a single HEIF/HEIC file.",
  "sources": "Reading PNG images from local filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "Saving the resulting HEIF file to local storage.",
  "flows": "Read images from disk -> convert images using pillow_heif -> save HEIF file to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, standard image format conversion without network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. It reads images locally, processes them with common libraries, and saves the output. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'quality=35' affects image compression but is benign. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's operations are transparent and typical for image processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for converting PNG images to HEIF format. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
