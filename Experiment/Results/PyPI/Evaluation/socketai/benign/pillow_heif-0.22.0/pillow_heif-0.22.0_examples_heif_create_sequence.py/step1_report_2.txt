{
  "purpose": "The code converts PNG images to a HEIF (.heic) file format by combining two images into a single HEIF file.",
  "sources": "The code reads image files from the filesystem, specifically from the 'images/non_heif/' directory and the current working directory.",
  "sinks": "The code writes a HEIF (.heic) file to the 'converted' directory.",
  "flows": "Image files are read from disk (sources), processed with pillow_heif and PIL libraries, and then the combined HEIF file is saved to disk (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The use of pillow_heif appears standard for image processing. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script changes working directories and reads two specific PNG images, then converts and combines them into a HEIF file, saving it in a designated folder. The operations use common image processing libraries without any dynamic code execution or external network calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The logic is straightforward, intended for image format conversion.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign image conversion task without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly handles image processing and file I/O with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
