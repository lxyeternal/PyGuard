{
  "purpose": "The code loads and displays all frames of a HEIC image file, specifically targeting image processing and visualization.",
  "sources": "Reading the file path 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' and opening it with Image.open()",
  "sinks": "Calling img.show() to display images; no other outputs or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "File path reading -> Image.open() -> ImageSequence.Iterator() -> img.show()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code detected. Usage of pillow_heif for HEIC images is standard; no obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script changes directory to a specific 'tests' folder, then registers HEIF format support with pillow_heif, and opens a specific HEIC image file. It iterates through all image frames in the HEIC file and displays each frame. No input validation, network activity, or other suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a standard image processing demo or test script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image viewer utility that processes HEIC images. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to serve a benign purpose related to image handling.",
