{
  "purpose": "The code displays thumbnails and images from a specified HEIC image file, primarily for viewing or testing image handling.",
  "sources": "Reads the HEIC image file at 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' using PIL's Image.open.",
  "sinks": "Potentially displays images via img.show(), which can invoke external image viewer applications.",
  "flows": "Image file is read from disk, opened, and then each frame is displayed using the default image viewer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script changes directory to a 'tests' folder, registers HEIF image support, and opens a specific HEIC image file. It iterates through all frames of the image (if animated) and displays each frame using the default viewer. There are no untrusted data inputs beyond file reading, no network communication, and no suspicious code behaviors. The use of PIL and pillow_heif libraries is standard for image processing. The code's structure is straightforward and lacks any malicious or obfuscated features.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign image viewing function with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard libraries for image handling and does not include any malicious behaviors.",
