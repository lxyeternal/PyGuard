  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward image viewer for HEIC images.\n   - No suspicious network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected.\n   - The code uses standard libraries (`PIL`, `pillow_heif`) and performs typical image processing tasks.\n\n2. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code changes the working directory to a 'tests' folder relative to its location.\n   - Registers HEIF support via `pillow_heif.register_heif_opener()`.\n   - Opens a specific HEIC file and iterates through all frames, displaying each.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Scores:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n4. **Assessment of Report Reasoning & Scores:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n   - The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports seems to be a conservative acknowledgment that the code displays images, which could be misused in a different context, but in this case, it’s benign.\n\n5. **Any Overestimation or Underestimation?**\n   - The malware scores are appropriate at 0.\n   - The obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n   - The security risk scores are also reasonable, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The code is a simple image viewer for HEIC images, with no malicious intent.\n   - No indication of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the code’s behavior.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal inherent risk in displaying images, but overall benign)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately. No changes are necessary.",
