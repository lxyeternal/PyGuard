{
  "purpose": "The code loads and displays all frames from a HEIC image file located in a specific directory, primarily for image processing or viewing.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' using PIL's Image.open()",
  "sinks": "The img.show() function displays images, which could potentially be misused for social engineering if misused in a larger context; no other sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Source (file read) via Image.open() -> processing with ImageSequence.Iterator() -> display with img.show()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard usage of PIL and pillow_heif libraries; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory to a 'tests' folder relative to the script's location. It registers the HEIF opener via pillow_heif, then opens a specific HEIC image. It iterates through all frames of the image and displays each one. The code relies on third-party libraries (PIL, pillow_heif) that are commonly used for image processing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The operations performed are typical for image viewing and processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard image loading and display functions without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign script intended for image processing, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
