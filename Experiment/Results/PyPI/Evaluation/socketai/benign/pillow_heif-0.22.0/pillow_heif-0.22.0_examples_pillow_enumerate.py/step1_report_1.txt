{
  "purpose": "The code loads and displays all frames from a HEIC image file using PIL and pillow_heif libraries.",
  "sources": "os.path, Path, Image.open, ImageSequence.Iterator, pillow_heif.register_heif_opener()",
  "sinks": "img.show() (displays images), potentially reading from a file system path",
  "flows": "register_heif_opener() enables reading HEIC files, then Image.open reads the specified HEIC file, ImageSequence iterates over frames, and img.show() displays each frame",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain calls, or unusual code structures. The code relies on external libraries for image processing. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script sets its working directory to a 'tests' folder relative to its location, then registers the HEIF image opener to handle HEIC files with Pillow. It opens a specific HEIC file ('images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic') and iterates through all frames, displaying each. All operations are consistent with image processing and display functionality. No data leakage, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The use of well-known libraries (PIL, pillow_heif) and straightforward code indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple image viewer script for HEIC images that uses standard libraries and no suspicious or malicious features. It appears to be benign and focused on image processing tasks.",
