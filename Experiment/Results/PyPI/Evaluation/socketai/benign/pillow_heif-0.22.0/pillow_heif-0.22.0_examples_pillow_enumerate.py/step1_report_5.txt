{
  "purpose": "The script loads and displays all frames from a HEIC image file, specifically for testing or viewing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the image file at 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' using Image.open(). Changes the current working directory to a 'tests' directory relative to the script's location.",
  "sinks": "The img.show() function displays images on the screen; no data leaks or external network actions occur here.",
  "flows": "The file path is set and used as input to Image.open(), then the image frames are iterated over and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard libraries and methods. No obfuscation, no dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the working directory relative to its location, registers a HEIF opener to handle HEIC images, opens a specific image file, and displays all frames in a window. It uses standard, well-known libraries (PIL and pillow_heif) for image processing. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or network activity. The code appears to be a simple viewer or test script for HEIC images.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward image loading and displaying without any malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious behaviors are present, and it uses common libraries appropriately.",
