{
  "purpose": "The code registers HEIF image support, opens a specific HEIC file, and displays all frames using PIL and pillow_heif.",
  "sources": "Reads the HEIC image file at 'images/heif_other/nokia/alpha.heic' using Image.open().",
  "sinks": "img.show() invokes an external image viewer to display images.",
  "flows": "Source (image file) -> Image.open() -> ImageSequence.Iterator() -> img.show()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. Use of img.show() could be misused in malicious contexts, but not here.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard image processing: it changes directory, registers HEIF support, opens a HEIC image, iterates through frames, and displays each. No malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The code relies on common libraries and executes straightforward functions. The use of img.show() is typical for image display and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign image viewer for HEIC images with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the low security risk. No modifications are necessary.",
