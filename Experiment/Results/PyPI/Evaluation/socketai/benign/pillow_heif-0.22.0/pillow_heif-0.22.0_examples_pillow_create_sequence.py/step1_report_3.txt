{
  "purpose": "The script converts PNG images to a HEIF format (.heic) and saves the result in a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from 'images/non_heif/' directory; reads environment variables and file paths using os and pathlib.",
  "sinks": "Saves the resulting HEIF file to the 'converted' directory.",
  "flows": "Reads PNG images from disk -> processes images with PIL -> saves HEIF file to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and typical for image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the working directory, creates a target folder, loads two PNG images, and saves them as a single HEIF file. It uses standard libraries and a third-party plugin for HEIF support. No data is sent over the network, no user input is processed that could lead to injection or data leakage. No suspicious code paths or malicious behavior detected. The use of 'quality' parameter and image processing is normal. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate image conversion utility without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It operates locally, processing images and saving output files without any evidence of malware or security risks.",
