  "purpose": "Convert PNG images to a HEIF (.heic) format and save the result in a specified directory.",
  "sources": "Reading image files from 'images/non_heif/' directory; reading current script path and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Saving the resulting HEIC file to the target directory.",
  "flows": "Reading image files -> processing images -> saving as HEIC file in the target folder.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; the code performs standard image processing and file saving operations. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory relative to its location, loads two PNG images, and saves them as a HEIC file in a target directory. It uses the Pillow library and pillow_heif plugin for HEIF support. The code does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. No sensitive information is handled or leaked. The image processing is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard image conversion script with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It safely converts images to HEIF format for legitimate use cases.",
