{
  "purpose": "Converts two PNG images into a combined HEIF (.heic) file using standard image processing libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk at specified paths.",
  "sinks": "Saves the resulting HEIF file to disk.",
  "flows": "Reads PNG images from disk -> processes images in memory -> saves combined image as HEIF file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward image loading and saving operations with standard libraries and a known plugin for HEIF support. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The process is local and benign. The code's intent is to combine images into a HEIF container, which is a common image processing task. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image conversion script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
