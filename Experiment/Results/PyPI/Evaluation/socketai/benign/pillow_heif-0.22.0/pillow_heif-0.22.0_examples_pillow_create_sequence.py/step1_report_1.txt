  "purpose": "The script converts PNG images to a HEIF (.heic) format, specifically combining two images into a single HEIF file.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from the filesystem: 'images/non_heif/RGB_8__29x100.png' and 'images/non_heif/RGBA_8__128x128.png'.",
  "sinks": "Saves the resulting HEIF file to the target directory '../converted/RGB_A_8.heic'.",
  "flows": "Reads image files from disk, processes them with PIL, and saves the combined image as a HEIF file to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. Uses standard image processing libraries; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the working directory relative to its location, loads two PNG images, and saves them as a combined HEIF image. It imports 'pillow_heif.HeifImagePlugin' to handle HEIF format support, which is standard. No user input handling or external network interactions are present. The process appears straightforward and benign, focused on image conversion. No obfuscated code, suspicious file operations, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign image conversion utility with no signs of malicious behavior. It processes images and saves output locally without any suspicious activities.",
