{
  "purpose": "The script converts PNG images to a HEIF (.heic) format by combining two images into a single HEIF file.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from the specified 'images/non_heif/' directory using Image.open() and the script's current directory for path resolution.",
  "sinks": "Saves the resulting HEIF file to the target folder '../converted' using img1.save().",
  "flows": "Reads image files from disk -> loads images into memory -> saves combined images into HEIF format in the target directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of external libraries (PIL, pillow_heif) appears legitimate. No obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code sets the working directory, reads two PNG images, and saves them as a combined HEIF file. It uses standard libraries (os, pathlib, PIL, pillow_heif) in a typical manner. No untrusted input handling, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is observed. The code functions as an image conversion tool with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward image processing utility for converting images to HEIF format. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code poses no threat based on this review.",
