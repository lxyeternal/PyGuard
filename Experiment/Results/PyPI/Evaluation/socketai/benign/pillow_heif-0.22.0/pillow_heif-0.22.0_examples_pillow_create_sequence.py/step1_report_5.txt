  "purpose": "Convert PNG images to HEIF format and save the result.",
  "sources": "Reading image files from specified paths using PIL's Image.open.",
  "sinks": "Saving the combined image as a HEIF (.heic) file in the target directory.",
  "flows": "Image files are opened as sources, then combined and saved as a HEIF image to the target path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard image processing libraries and file operations. No unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory, prepares a target folder, opens two PNG images, and saves a combined image as a HEIF (.heic) file. The use of pillow_heif for HEIF support is standard. No data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. No suspicious file access patterns or environment variable misuse are evident. The code appears solely focused on image processing without external communication or covert actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs image conversion using common libraries with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply converts images and saves the result locally.",
