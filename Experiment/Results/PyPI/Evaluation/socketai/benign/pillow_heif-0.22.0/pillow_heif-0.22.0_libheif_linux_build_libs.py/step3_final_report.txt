  "purpose": "Automate the download, extraction, configuration, build, and installation of various open-source libraries for Linux, primarily for media processing components.",
  "sources": "URLs for source code archives, environment variables for directories, system commands for building and configuring libraries.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands (wget, curl, tar, cmake, make), writing to environment variables, changing directories, removing files.",
  "flows": "Download files from URLs -> extract to directories -> configure build environment -> compile -> install libraries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward build automation. Silent failure handling in download functions could mask issues but is typical in build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build automation script for open-source libraries, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It relies on publicly available URLs and executes system commands for building. The main security concern is the lack of checksum or signature verification for downloaded files, which could be exploited if URLs are compromised. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The malware score is therefore minimal, and the overall security risk is low but not negligible due to external dependencies. The code's transparency and straightforward structure support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build automation tool with no malicious intent or payloads. The primary security concern is the reliance on external sources without integrity verification, which could be exploited in a supply chain attack. The malware score is effectively zero, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk is low (around 0.2). Implementing checksum validation would mitigate this risk further.",
