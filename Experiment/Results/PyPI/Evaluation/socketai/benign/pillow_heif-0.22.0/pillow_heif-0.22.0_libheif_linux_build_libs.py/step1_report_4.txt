  "purpose": "This script automates the process of downloading, extracting, configuring, building, and installing various Linux libraries (LibHeif, x265, AOM, libde265) from specified URLs for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "URLs for downloading library archives, environment variables (BUILD_DIR, INSTALL_DIR_LIBS, PH_LIGHT_ACTION), system commands (wget, curl, tar, gcc, cmake, make), subprocess outputs (tool versions, library checks), user environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external commands for downloading, extracting, patching, configuring, building, and installing libraries; system-level commands like ldconfig; changing directories; modifying file permissions.",
  "flows": "Download URLs -> download_file() (via wget or curl) -> extract to directories -> run configuration commands (cmake, make) -> install libraries -> update system cache (ldconfig).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; commented-out patches; use of system commands with concatenated strings; downloading and executing external build tools; environment-dependent behavior; potential risks from running shell commands directly with external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs routine build automation tasks with standard practices such as version checking, downloading, extracting, and building libraries. It uses subprocess calls to invoke system tools and handles errors gracefully. The use of external URLs and command execution introduces potential risks if URLs or commands are tampered with, but there are no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The code does not contain obfuscated segments or suspicious data exfiltration. The primary concern is the execution of external commands and the download of code from remote URLs, which could be compromised if the URLs are malicious or the network is compromised. However, the URLs appear to be legitimate repositories hosting open-source libraries, and no malicious behaviors like network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors are evident in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a build automation script for open-source libraries, with no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs standard operations for downloading, building, and installing libraries, with no hidden backdoors or malicious payloads detected. The main security concern is reliance on external URLs and execution of system commands, which should be verified for integrity and authenticity, but the code itself is benign.",
