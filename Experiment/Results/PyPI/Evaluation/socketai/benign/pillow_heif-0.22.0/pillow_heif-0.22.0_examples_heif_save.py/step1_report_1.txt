  "purpose": "Convert HEIF images from one format to another with lower quality settings.",
  "sources": "Reads a specific image file 'images/heif_other/cat.hif' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Saves the converted image to the '../converted' directory with specified quality.",
  "flows": "Reads the input image from the filesystem, processes it with 'pillow_heif', then writes the output image to the target directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory, loads an HEIF image file, converts it with specified parameters, and saves the output. The use of 'pillow_heif' is standard for image processing. No user input or environment variables are used insecurely. No network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and focused on image conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard image conversion task without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script for image processing.",
