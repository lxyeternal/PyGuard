  "purpose": "Convert a HEIF image file from one format to another with reduced quality using the pillow_heif library.",
  "sources": "Reading the image file 'images/heif_other/cat.hif' using pillow_heif.open_heif.",
  "sinks": "Saving the processed image to the 'converted' directory as a HEIC file with specified quality settings.",
  "flows": "Source: open_heif reads 'cat.hif'; Sink: save writes the output file in the target directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors. Usage of third-party library appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a working directory relative to the script location, processes an image file with pillow_heif, and saves the output. It explicitly reduces image quality during saving, which is typical for format conversion or optimization. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or system modification. The code is straightforward, with no unusual constructs or obfuscation. It relies on a known library for image processing. No hidden or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard image format conversion with quality reduction. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks identified. It appears safe and intended for image processing tasks.",
