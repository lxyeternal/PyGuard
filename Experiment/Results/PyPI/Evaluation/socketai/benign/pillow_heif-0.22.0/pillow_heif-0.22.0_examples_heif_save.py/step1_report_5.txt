{
  "purpose": "The code converts a HEIF image file from one format to another with lower quality settings.",
  "sources": "Reads the image file 'images/heif_other/cat.hif' from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writes the converted image to a new file in the '../converted' directory.",
  "flows": "Reads the input image file -> processes it with pillow_heif.open_heif -> saves the processed image to the target path with specified quality.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code performs standard image processing operations. The use of 'pillow_heif' appears legitimate. No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles file I/O for image conversion. It modifies images using a known library, with no evident malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution. No secret data handling or external network connections are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple image conversion script that does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
