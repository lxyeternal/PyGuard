{
  "purpose": "The code reads a HEIF image file, extracts various metadata (ICC profiles, EXIF, NCLX, XMP, custom metadata), and prints this information.",
  "sources": "Reads the image file '../tests/images/heif_other/cat.hif', and data within image.info such as 'icc_profile', 'exif', 'nclx_profile', 'xmp', and 'metadata'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs metadata information via print statements; no data is sent elsewhere or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Reads image file -> extracts metadata fields -> processes ICC profile with BytesIO and ImageCms -> loads EXIF with piexif -> prints metadata details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Uses standard libraries for image processing.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward extraction and printing of image metadata from a static HEIF file. It uses well-known libraries without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data modification. The only potential concern is that processing maliciously crafted images could exploit underlying library vulnerabilities, but this is a risk inherent to image processing, not the code itself. The malware score is therefore 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the minimal threat posed by the code's actions. The code's structure is clear and readable, with no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard image metadata extraction script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes a specific image file and outputs metadata information. The scores are consistent with its behavior, indicating no malware and minimal security risk.",
