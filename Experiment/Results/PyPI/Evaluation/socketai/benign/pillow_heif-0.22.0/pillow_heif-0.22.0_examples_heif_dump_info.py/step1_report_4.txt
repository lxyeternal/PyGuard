{
  "purpose": "The code reads and extracts metadata from HEIF image files, including EXIF, ICC, NCLX, and other metadata profiles.",
  "sources": "Reads image file from the filesystem ('../tests/images/heif_other/cat.hif') and accesses various metadata information within the image, including ICC profiles, EXIF data, and XMP data.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output metadata, which is considered a safe sink. No data is sent over network, written to external systems, or executed.",
  "flows": "Reads image file -> extracts metadata -> outputs metadata via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or unusual logic. Uses standard libraries and third-party modules to process image data. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward metadata extraction from HEIF images using open-source libraries like pillow_heif, piexif, and PIL. It reads the file path, verifies support, retrieves image info, and prints metadata. No user input handling beyond a static filename, no network activity, and no suspicious code flows detected. The code does not modify, send, or store sensitive data maliciously. It solely processes and displays metadata information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata extraction script for HEIF images, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and purely informational.",
