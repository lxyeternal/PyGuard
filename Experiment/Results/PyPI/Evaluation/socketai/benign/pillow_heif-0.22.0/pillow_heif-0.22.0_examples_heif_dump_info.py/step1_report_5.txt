  "purpose": "The script inspects HEIF/HEIC image files to extract metadata and image information, including EXIF, ICC profiles, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads file from disk ('file' variable), accesses image info and metadata from image objects.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output; no data is sent externally or stored.",
  "flows": "Reads file → parses image data and metadata → prints information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. No suspicious data handling observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs metadata extraction from an image file using well-known libraries (pillow_heif, PIL, piexif, ImageCms). It reads the image file, extracts various metadata including ICC, EXIF, and XMP profiles, and outputs this information. All operations are read-only and for informational purposes. There are no external data transmissions, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious behaviors. The usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic reduces concern for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward image metadata extractor with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It solely reads local files and outputs their metadata information without performing any harmful actions.",
