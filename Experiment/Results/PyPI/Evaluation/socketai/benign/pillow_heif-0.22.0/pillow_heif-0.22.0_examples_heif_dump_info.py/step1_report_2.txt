{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to open a HEIF image file, extract various metadata and image information, and display it for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads the file path string, reads image data through pillow_heif.open_heif(), reads ICC profile data, EXIF data, XMP data, and other metadata from the image info dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console via print statements, parses image profiles and metadata, loads ICC profiles with ImageCms.getProfileDescription(), loads EXIF data with piexif.load().",
  "flows": "Reads the file path -> opens the image file -> extracts image info and metadata -> loads ICC profile and EXIF data for processing -> outputs information to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code mainly reads and outputs metadata. Usage of BytesIO for ICC profile parsing is standard. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads image metadata from a specified HEIF file, displaying various image attributes, ICC profiles, EXIF, XMP, and other metadata blocks. It utilizes well-known libraries (pillow_heif, PIL.ImageCms, piexif) for standard image processing tasks. No user input is processed beyond the static file path. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity is detected. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard image metadata extraction and display. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided analysis. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes related to image processing.",
