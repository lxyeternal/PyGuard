{
  "purpose": "The code provides an English noun inflector with pluralization and singularization functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'word' parameter in both pluralize() and singularize() functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that execute untrusted data; no network, file, or system commands are invoked.",
  "flows": "The input 'word' is processed through regex rules and lookup tables, with no external data flows or execution of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard regex pattern matching and string replacements; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. There are no external network connections or code execution mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward linguistic rules for English noun inflection. It relies solely on regex pattern matching and string manipulations, using no dynamic code execution, external data sources, or system interactions. The uncountable and irregular word lists are hardcoded, which is typical for such utility functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The license comments are benign and standard. Overall, the code performs a well-understood task without any suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard linguistic utility for pluralizing and singularizing English nouns. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
