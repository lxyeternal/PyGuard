{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to pluralize and singularize English nouns using regex-based rules, irregular word mappings, and uncountable word lists.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is contained within the code as static rules, lists, and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist in the code; no data is written to files, network, or external systems. The functions return transformed words based on regex matching.",
  "flows": "Input word → regex matching and rule application → return transformed word",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code appears to be straightforward linguistic processing without obfuscation or hidden actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two main methods, 'pluralize' and 'singularize', which use regex rules, uncountable words, and irregular mappings to convert words between singular and plural forms. No external data or network interactions are present. The logic is contained and clear. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The code is for linguistic transformation only.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs linguistic transformations on English nouns without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It is a standard implementation for pluralization and singularization, with no indication of malware or security risks.",
