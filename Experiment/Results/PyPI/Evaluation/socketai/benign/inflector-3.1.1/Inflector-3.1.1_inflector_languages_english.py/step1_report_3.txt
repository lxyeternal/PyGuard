{
  "purpose": "Implementing pluralization and singularization rules for English nouns as part of an inflector library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input words to convert between singular and plural forms.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through regex rules and dictionaries to produce inflected forms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious dynamic behavior observed. The code appears purely linguistic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines rules and dictionaries for English noun inflection. It processes input words to determine their plural or singular forms using regex matching and replacements. No external network or file operations, no use of environment variables, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The code relies solely on in-memory data structures and regex operations, which are standard for such linguistic tasks. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an English inflection library without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, domain-specific utility with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
