{
  "purpose": "The code provides an inflector class for pluralizing and singularizing English nouns, primarily used for linguistic transformations in software.",
  "sources": "Reads input words from function parameters 'word' in pluralize and singularize methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling; the code performs string matching and substitution without external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through regex matching and substitutions within methods, with no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard regex-based transformations without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to pluralize and singularize English nouns based on regex rules, uncountable word lists, and irregular mappings. It performs regex matches and substitutions to transform words. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears purely linguistic with standard Python practices. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The license and comments are typical for open-source projects, and the code operates solely in-memory without external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard language inflector module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It functions as a linguistic utility, and there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
