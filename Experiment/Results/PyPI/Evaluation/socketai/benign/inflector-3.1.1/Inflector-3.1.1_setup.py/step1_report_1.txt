  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and package a Python library called 'Inflector' for distribution, including reading metadata files and configuring package details.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem: 'README.md', 'VERSION', and the script's directory for setup information.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data affects system state or outputs; standard setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads files ('README.md' and 'VERSION') to incorporate their content into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, reading metadata files and configuring package details. It uses safe file reading methods and does not execute or evaluate untrusted data dynamically. No network activity, no suspicious imports beyond standard modules, and no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
