  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for packaging the 'Inflector' library, reading static files and invoking setuptools.setup() with metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'VERSION' files from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "File reads to setup() invocation; no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file reads and setup invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads static files and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The file reads are straightforward and use explicit encoding. No suspicious patterns or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
