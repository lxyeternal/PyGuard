{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'Inflector'. It prepares package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'VERSION' files to include package description and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for metadata, then passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity. File reads are straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', then reads static files ('README.md' and 'VERSION') to retrieve package metadata. It then calls 'setup()' with this data along with other package information. No untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no code execution beyond standard package setup. The code appears standard for a Python package setup script without signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, typical setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected.",
