{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'Inflector' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md and VERSION files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; no network or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Reading static files (README.md and VERSION) and passing their contents into setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads local files for package metadata and passes them into setuptools.setup() for package configuration. It uses standard practices and does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could be malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
