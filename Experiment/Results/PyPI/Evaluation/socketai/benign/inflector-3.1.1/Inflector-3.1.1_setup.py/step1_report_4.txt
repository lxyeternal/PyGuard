  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> Using data in setup() function for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for setup, reads package description and version information from local files, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no external inputs, no data transmission, no suspicious code logic, and no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply reads local files and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata.",
