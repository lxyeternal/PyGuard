{
  "purpose": "A utility class for string manipulation and naming conventions, primarily for use in Rails-like applications.",
  "sources": "Import from inflector.languages.english, class instantiation, method calls on self._language",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data, no network operations, database access, or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input string parameters flow through various language methods that perform transformations (pluralize, underscore, camelize, etc.) without involving external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code mainly delegates processing to methods of a language object.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a wrapper class around a language-specific inflector for string manipulation. It performs standard string processing tasks and relies on a language module (imported from inflector.languages.english). No external data sources, no network activity, or code that could be malicious. The code appears straightforward, mainly delegating to the underlying language object. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malware behavior. No suspicious data handling, no untrusted input processing beyond string transformations, and no side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility class for string transformations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and benign, functioning as a delegate to language-specific string manipulation functions.",
