{
  "purpose": "A utility class providing string transformation methods by delegating to a language-specific module, used for naming conventions and text formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from inflector.languages.english, method calls to self._language's functions",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file I/O operations are present",
  "flows": "Method calls on self._language object passing input parameters and returning results",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated alias methods (conditionalPlural, foreignKey), which are harmless but indicate versioning; no malicious or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around a language module, providing string manipulation utilities such as pluralization, singularization, titleization, camelization, underscoring, humanization, variablization, table/class name conversions, ordinalization, unaccenting, urlizing, demodulizing, modulizing, and foreign key formatting. It performs no external data handling, network communication, or system modifications. The only minor point is the deprecated alias methods, which are not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, utility-focused wrapper for string transformations, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk and malware scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
