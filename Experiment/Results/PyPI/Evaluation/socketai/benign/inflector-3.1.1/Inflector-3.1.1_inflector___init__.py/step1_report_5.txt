{
  "purpose": "A utility class providing methods for string manipulation and naming conventions used in programming, particularly for Rails-like applications.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'English' language module from 'inflector.languages'; usage of 'assert callable(language)'; method parameters accepting input strings and numbers.",
  "sinks": "Methods that process external input include 'pluralize', 'singularize', 'conditional_plural', 'titleize', 'camelize', 'underscore', 'humanize', 'variablize', 'tableize', 'classify', 'ordinalize', 'unaccent', 'urlize', 'demodulize', 'modulize', 'foreign_key', 'foreignKey'.",
  "flows": "Input strings or numbers flow through various string manipulation methods which call corresponding methods on the '_language' object, such as 'pluralize', 'camelize', etc. No network or file system operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code primarily delegates processing to methods of an external language module. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility class that wraps calls to a language-specific implementation for string transformations and naming conventions. It validates that the language module is callable during initialization. No external data sources, network activity, or potentially malicious behaviors are present. The methods are simple wrappers without internal logic that could be exploited. Overall, the code appears to be benign and intended for standard string manipulation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for string and naming convention transformations. It delegates processing to an external language module without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware signs detected.",
