{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite for the Inflector class, verifying English pluralization and singularization mappings using a static dictionary.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the static dictionary 'singular_to_plural' for expected word mappings.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "The test functions pass each word through the inflector's pluralize and singularize methods, comparing results against the static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs in-memory tests of an external inflector library, with no external data, network activity, or system modifications. The static dictionary contains common words with expected transformations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The test suite is well-structured, and the logic is clear. The external dependency 'inflector' is assumed legitimate; the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test for linguistic transformations, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
