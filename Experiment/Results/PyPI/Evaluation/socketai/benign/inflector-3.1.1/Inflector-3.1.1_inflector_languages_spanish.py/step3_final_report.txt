{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Spanish noun inflector, providing pluralization and singularization functions based on regex rules, irregular, and uncountable word lists.",
  "sources": "Input is received via method parameters ('word') for pluralize and singularize functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or system interactions; purely string processing within the functions.",
  "flows": "Input 'word' flows through regex matching and replacements within the functions, with no external data or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "Regex patterns contain syntax errors (e.g., empty character classes '[]', unmatched brackets), comments indicate regex limitations, but no malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a linguistic utility for Spanish noun inflection, relying on regex rules, irregular, and uncountable word lists. Many regex patterns are malformed, which could cause runtime errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external system interactions. The regex flaws are bugs, not malicious activity. The malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting regex syntax issues that could cause failures but not security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward but poorly maintained, with no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign linguistic utility with technical regex flaws. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The main concern is fixing regex patterns to ensure proper functionality. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code does not pose a supply chain threat.",
