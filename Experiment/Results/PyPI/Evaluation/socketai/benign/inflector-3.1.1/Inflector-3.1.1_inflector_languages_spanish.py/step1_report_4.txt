{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Spanish language inflector for pluralizing and singularizing Spanish nouns, intended for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input words from function parameters 'word' in pluralize() and singularize() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code performs regex matching and substitution on input words; no direct sink for untrusted external data or malicious actions detected.",
  "flows": "Input words are processed through regex rules and irregular mappings; no external data flow or network communication present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous typos and inconsistent regex patterns (e.g., unmatched brackets, malformed regex patterns), indicating possible bugs but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features are detected. No obfuscated code or external system interactions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a linguistic utility module for Spanish noun inflection with standard regex rules, irregular word handling, and uncountable word management. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code contains syntactical issues that could cause runtime errors but do not suggest malicious intent. No evidence of malware or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a linguistic processing utility with significant code quality issues but no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not exhibit behaviors typical of malware or supply chain compromise. The main concerns relate to bugs and potential runtime errors, not security.",
