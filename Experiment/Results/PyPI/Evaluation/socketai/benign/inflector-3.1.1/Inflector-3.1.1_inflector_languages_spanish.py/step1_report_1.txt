{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Spanish inflector for pluralizing and singularizing Spanish nouns, mainly for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input word as a parameter in the 'pluralize' and 'singularize' methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data processing or output; no network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The input word flows through regular expression matching and replacement rules within 'pluralize' and 'singularize' methods; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous regex rules with potentially inconsistent or malformed patterns, but these are typical for linguistic processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code does include some comments indicating potential failures but no malicious code intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two main methods for Spanish noun inflection, using regex rules, uncountable and irregular word lists. The regex patterns appear to be for linguistic transformations rather than malicious purposes. There are no external data sources, network connections, or environment manipulations. The code lacks any form of data exfiltration, system commands, or backdoors. The presence of comments about possible failures in regex suggests awareness of pattern limitations, not malicious intent. Overall, the code performs language processing without evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a linguistic utility for Spanish noun inflections with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
