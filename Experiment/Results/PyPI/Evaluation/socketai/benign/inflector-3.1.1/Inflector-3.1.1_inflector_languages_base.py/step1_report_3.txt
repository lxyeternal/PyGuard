{
  "purpose": "Provide string manipulation and naming convention utilities for localization and code generation.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input or external data sources; methods operate on input parameters like 'word', 'text', or 'number' passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is sent to external systems, network, or file system; no command execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within the methods, transforming input strings or numbers into different formats or naming conventions, with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard utility functions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with multiple string and name formatting methods typical in localization or code generation utilities. It uses regular expressions and Unicode normalization for transformations. No external data reads, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code follows standard practices, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The license comments indicate open-source, non-malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of localization and naming utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any external data transmission, system manipulation, or hidden operations. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
