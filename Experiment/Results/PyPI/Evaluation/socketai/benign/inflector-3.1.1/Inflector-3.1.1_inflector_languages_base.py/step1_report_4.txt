  "purpose": "Provide string manipulation, naming conventions, and text transformation utilities for locale and code formatting tasks.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input or untrusted data; no input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions operate solely on their parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is primarily utility functions with standard regex and string operations. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a class with various string manipulation methods, including pluralization, case conversions, URL-safe transformations, and unaccenting Unicode text. The functions operate on provided arguments and do not perform network operations, file I/O, or any external data access. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. The only potential concern is that these functions could be misused in a larger context, but within this snippet, there is no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module focused on string and naming convention manipulations with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
