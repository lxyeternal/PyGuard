  "purpose": "String manipulation utilities for naming conventions, string transformations, and URL-friendly formatting.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing input strings; no external data sources or external system interactions.",
  "sinks": "Internal string operations; no external data leaks, network activity, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through regex and Unicode normalization functions to produce transformed strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of utility functions performing string transformations, pluralization, humanization, camelization, underscoring, and URLization. All operations are standard regex and Unicode normalization techniques, with no external data access, network communication, or command execution. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security scores assigned in the reports (mostly 0 or 0.1) are appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code does not perform any dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for string and naming conventions with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis; the overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, indicating no security concerns.",
