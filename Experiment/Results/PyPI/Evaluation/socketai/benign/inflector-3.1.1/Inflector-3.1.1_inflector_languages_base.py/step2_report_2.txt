  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code provides string/naming utilities, with inputs solely from function parameters. No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility functions, no security risks.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- `malware`: 0 — correct, no malicious behavior detected.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 — no external data, no external communication, no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, primarily string transformations with no external data or sinks.\n- **Malware & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; code is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, benign.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- `malware`: 0 — appropriate.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 — code is clear.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0.1 — very low, possibly accounting for the general risk of utility functions being misused if incorporated into larger, untrusted code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Same pattern: string manipulation utilities, no external data sources, no external sinks, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- `malware`: 0 — correct.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 — code is transparent.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 — consistent with benign utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar assessment: utility functions for string formatting, no external data or malicious patterns.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- `malware`: 0 — appropriate.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 — standard utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Same conclusion: utility functions, no external data, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- `malware`: 0 — correct.  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 — code is simple.  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 — safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close to it, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is purely a utility library for string and naming conventions, with no external dependencies or side effects.  \n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.  \n- The only minor point is the `securityRisk` score in report 2 being 0.1, which is acceptable as a conservative estimate, but even then, it's very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — confirmed safe.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk:** 0 for all — no security risks present.\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that these are standard, benign utility functions with no malicious or security concerns.",
