  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package in Python to allow multiple distributions to contribute to a shared namespace.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkg_resources' module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no external communication or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' followed by call to 'declare_namespace(__name__)' with no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__', a common pattern for namespace packages. It contains no input/output, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, well-understood, and used in standard Python packaging practices. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's purpose is purely structural, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard namespace declaration in Python with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
