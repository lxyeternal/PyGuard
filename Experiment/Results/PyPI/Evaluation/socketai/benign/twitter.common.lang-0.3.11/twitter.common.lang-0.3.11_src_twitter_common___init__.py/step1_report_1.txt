  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the use of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the package. It is a typical pattern for Python namespace packages, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No external data inputs, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
