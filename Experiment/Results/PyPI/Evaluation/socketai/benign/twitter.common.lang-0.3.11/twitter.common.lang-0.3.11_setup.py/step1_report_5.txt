  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code is a standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It includes package metadata such as classifiers, description, dependencies, license, name, namespace, package data, directory, list of packages, URL, version, and zip safety flag. The code is static, straightforward, and generated automatically, with no dynamic execution, code injection, or untrusted data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
