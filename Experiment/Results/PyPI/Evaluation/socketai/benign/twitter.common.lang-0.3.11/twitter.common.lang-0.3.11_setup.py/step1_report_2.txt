  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package 'twitter.common.lang'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script generated automatically for packaging. It imports 'setuptools' and invokes 'setup()' with a static dictionary defining package metadata. There are no sources of untrusted data, no execution of dynamic code, and no security-sensitive operations. The script appears to be a standard package configuration file with no malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
