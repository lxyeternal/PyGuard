  "purpose": "Standard autogenerated setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call, including classifiers, description, dependencies, license, package info, URL, version, and flags.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, data, or external data sources are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "A probable typo in the code: 'setup(**)' instead of 'setup(**{...})', which is likely a formatting or copy-paste error, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script generated automatically. No dynamic code, external data, or network activity is present. The only anomaly is a syntax-like typo that does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is negligible (around 0.1 due to the typo). The code's simplicity and static nature support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor typo is a formatting issue, not a security concern. Overall, the code poses no security risks, and the scores should reflect that.",
