{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities, singleton pattern, ordering decorators, abstract classes, and other foundational tools for Python code, mainly focusing on cross-version support and metaclass management.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, numbers, abc, functools, and internal module '.lockable'. Reads system version info and various standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present. No code executes untrusted input or handles external data. No network, file, or environment variable access is observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - No untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard utility and compatibility functions, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of compatibility layers and utility classes/functions designed for cross-version Python support, singleton pattern, ordering, and docstring inheritance. It uses standard, well-known patterns and libraries, with fallback implementations for older Python versions. No input reading, external data access, or suspicious logic identified. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present. The use of exec and compile is limited to standard Python compatibility purposes, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended as foundational utilities for Python projects with cross-version compatibility. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack features. It appears safe for use.",
