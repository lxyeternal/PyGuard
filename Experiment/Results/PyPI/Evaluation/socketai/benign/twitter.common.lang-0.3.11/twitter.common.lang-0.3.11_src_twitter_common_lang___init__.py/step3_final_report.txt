  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities, singleton pattern, ordering, abstract classes, and docstring inheritance mechanisms for cross-version Python support.",
  "sources": "Internal class definitions, import statements, and functions such as Compatibility.exec_function which executes compiled ASTs.",
  "sinks": "The exec_function method executes code dynamically, which could be a sink if untrusted code is passed, leading to potential code injection.",
  "flows": "The exec_function compiles and executes AST objects within a provided globals map, potentially allowing malicious code execution if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec and compile functions for cross-version compatibility; no external data sources or network activity; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility classes and functions aimed at ensuring compatibility across Python versions, implementing singleton pattern, total ordering fallback, abstract base classes, and inheriting docstrings. The only notable point is the exec_function method, which dynamically executes code objects. While this pattern is standard for compatibility, it introduces a potential security risk if misused with untrusted input. All other components are straightforward and do not process external data or contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility library with no malicious intent. The only security consideration is the exec_function method, which could be exploited if used improperly with untrusted code. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), slightly higher for the exec_function due to its potential misuse.",
