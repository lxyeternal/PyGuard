{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities, singleton pattern, and inheritance helpers for Python 2 and 3, along with some standard library imports and class decorators.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, numbers, .lockable, functools, abc), class definitions, try-except blocks for conditional imports, functions, and metaclass definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; code primarily defines classes, decorators, and compatibility functions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources directly linked to sensitive sinks; the code defines structural utilities without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated segments. Uses conditional imports and metaclasses for compatibility, which are standard patterns. No suspicious dynamic execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility and utility module designed for cross-version support. It includes class decorators, singleton metaclass, total_ordering fallback, and other abstract base classes. The use of try-except for imports, metaclasses, and decorators is standard practice. No signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not perform any external I/O, cryptographic operations, or privilege escalation. The only potentially unusual aspect is the dynamic exec in compatibility code, which is necessary for Python 2/3 compatibility and is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for Python compatibility and design patterns, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for such libraries.",
