{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for a larger Python project, facilitating the distribution of multiple packages under a common namespace.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' on the current module, which is a namespace declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not handle user input or external data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only performs a namespace declaration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It is a standard namespace declaration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace using 'declare_namespace'. This pattern is common in Python namespace packages. No other logic or data handling is present. No hardcoded secrets, external network access, or obfuscated code are involved. The purpose appears purely structural and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is typical for Python projects that split code into multiple packages sharing a common namespace.",
