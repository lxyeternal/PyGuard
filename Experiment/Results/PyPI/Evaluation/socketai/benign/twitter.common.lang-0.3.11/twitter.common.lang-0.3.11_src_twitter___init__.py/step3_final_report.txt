  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package in Python using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal, straightforward namespace declaration with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for defining a namespace package in Python, involving a minimal import and function call. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is well-formed, with licensing comments, and uses a common, safe pattern. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified.",
