  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports and invokes 'declare_namespace' from 'pkg_resources'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for namespace declaration; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with the current module name. This is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, no data handling, and no external network activity. The code appears to be part of standard package setup and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
