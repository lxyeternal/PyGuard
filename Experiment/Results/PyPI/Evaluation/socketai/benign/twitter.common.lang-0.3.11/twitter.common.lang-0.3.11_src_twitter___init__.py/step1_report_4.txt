{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, typically used for plugin or extension mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statement: __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import executes and declares namespace without external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with string argument; standard namespace declaration pattern; no unusual behavior or code obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically using __import__ and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python for namespace packages, with no evidence of malicious intent. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior are detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, aligning with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply facilitates package extension and modularity.",
