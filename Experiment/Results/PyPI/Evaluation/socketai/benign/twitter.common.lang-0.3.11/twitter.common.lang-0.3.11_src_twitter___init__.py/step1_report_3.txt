{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, allowing multiple distribution packages to share a common namespace.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code only declares a namespace.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as no data input or output is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a standard namespace declaration with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' on the current module, which is a standard pattern for namespace packages in Python. It contains only license comments and a simple namespace declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The presence of license comments indicates legal usage intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign namespace declaration code snippet, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a common pattern used in Python package development to support namespace packages.",
