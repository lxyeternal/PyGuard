  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors that pose a high supply chain security risk, primarily due to remote code execution without validation, insecure permissions, and credential handling. While no explicit malicious code is embedded, the potential for malicious exploitation is significant. The malware score should be set near 0.9, and the security risk score around 0.85 to accurately reflect these risks."
