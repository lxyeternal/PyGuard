  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cloud metadata utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. Security risks are mainly due to insecure practices that should be mitigated, but these do not constitute malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0, with a moderate risk score around 0.3 for insecure network and logging practices."
