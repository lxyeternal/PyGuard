  "purpose": "Retrieve cloud provider instance details and credentials across AWS, GCP, and Azure, with debug modes for testing.",
  "sources": "External URL fetch functions (safe_read_simple_url, safe_get_json, safe_put_simple_url), local file reads for metadata, environment variables for credentials.",
  "sinks": "Logging sensitive info (host, instance IDs, tokens), network requests to metadata endpoints, file reads for IDs.",
  "flows": "Input credentials and config -> fetch instance metadata via URLs or files -> process and return instance details.",
  "anomalies": "Debug mode with hardcoded dummy credentials, logging sensitive info, use of HTTP instead of HTTPS for metadata endpoints, reading sensitive data from local files without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cloud metadata retrieval for AWS, GCP, and Azure, with debug modes that insert dummy data. It uses external utility functions presumed safe, and handles sensitive data in memory. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only security concerns are insecure practices such as logging sensitive info, using HTTP instead of HTTPS, and enabling debug modes in production. These are operational security issues, not malicious behaviors. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent or code is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting the insecure practices but not active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cloud metadata utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. Security risks are mainly due to insecure practices that should be mitigated, but these do not constitute malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0, with a moderate risk score around 0.3 for insecure network and logging practices.",
