  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'spotinst-agent' package, used to configure package installation details.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for description data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data flows or external commands executed.",
  "flows": "Reads description files; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant file opening for 'README.rst'; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading the README for descriptions and defining package metadata. It imports only standard and well-known libraries ('setuptools', 'os', 'codecs') without executing or manipulating data from untrusted sources. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling present. No obfuscated or malicious code identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and solely responsible for package installation setup.",
