      "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors that pose a high supply chain security risk, primarily due to remote code execution without validation, insecure permissions, and credential handling. While no explicit malicious code is embedded, the potential for malicious exploitation is significant. The malware score should be set near 0.9, and the security risk score around 0.85 to accurately reflect these risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source task scheduler with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. Its features are standard for such utilities, and the security risk is low but slightly above zero due to the potential misuse of process and thread control if malicious functions are scheduled. Overall, it is safe for use in trusted environments."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concerns relate to plaintext credential storage and lack of input validation, which are hygiene issues rather than malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting these hygiene issues. Overall, the code is safe but should be improved in credential handling and input validation practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cloud metadata utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. Security risks are mainly due to insecure practices that should be mitigated, but these do not constitute malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0, with a moderate risk score around 0.3 for insecure network and logging practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with scheduling capabilities, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security risk is the trust in external modules loaded dynamically, which could be exploited if directories are compromised. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be increased to reflect the potential for supply chain attacks, with a recommended value around 0.6. Overall, the code is benign but requires operational controls to ensure directory integrity."
