  "purpose": "Base class for modules that includes logging, error handling, and scheduling functionalities for worker modules.",
  "sources": "Logging statements, class attributes, and method calls within the class, especially __init__, _run, get_schedule, get_enable, load_splay, load_interval.",
  "sinks": "Logging output; no data sinks or external data outputs are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization logs info about running, error logs traceback on exceptions. No external data or untrusted input flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. load_splay() and load_interval() are placeholders without implementation, which could be benign or suspicious but currently are not.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for modules, including standard logging, exception handling, and schedule configuration. There are no input sources like user data or environment variables, nor are there sinks that send data externally. The methods load_splay() and load_interval() are empty, which might be placeholders for future code but do not contain malicious code. The code is straightforward and follows typical design patterns for modular worker classes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module base class with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign structure intended for extension. The empty methods could be part of a larger framework but do not currently pose security concerns.",
