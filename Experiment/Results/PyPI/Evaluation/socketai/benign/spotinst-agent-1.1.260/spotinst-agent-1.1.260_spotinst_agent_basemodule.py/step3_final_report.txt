  "purpose": "A base class for modules providing logging, error handling, and scheduling configuration.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; only internal method calls and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; purely internal logic.",
  "flows": "Initialization and scheduling setup without external data flow; placeholder methods are unused.",
  "anomalies": "Methods 'load_splay' and 'load_interval' are unimplemented, but this is typical for base classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign, standard framework component with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues. The placeholder methods are common and do not introduce vulnerabilities. No external data handling or suspicious behaviors are present. The consistent scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 across reports are justified. The low security risk scores reflect the benign nature, with slight variation due to unimplemented methods, but these pose no current threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard base class for modular components, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
