  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concerns relate to plaintext credential storage and lack of input validation, which are hygiene issues rather than malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting these hygiene issues. Overall, the code is safe but should be improved in credential handling and input validation practices."
