  "purpose": "Utility functions for safe URL requests, metadata retrieval, YAML parsing, and dynamic class loading, primarily for cloud and API interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads from URLs (via urlopen, Request), local files (/root/.spotinst/credentials).",
  "sinks": "Response.read() (returns data), log.error() (potential data exposure through logs).",
  "flows": "Input URLs (possibly untrusted) to urlopen and response.read() to return data; reading credentials file; dynamic class import from string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (catch-all), no input validation for URLs or credentials, potential sensitive info in logs, loading credentials from fixed path, no explicit security checks for URL responses.",
  "analysis": "The code includes multiple network request functions (GET, POST, PUT) that operate on potentially untrusted URLs. There are no apparent malicious payloads or obfuscation techniques; however, the functions handle untrusted data without validation, which could be exploited if URLs are controlled by an attacker. The credential retrieval reads from a fixed file path, which could be a security concern if sensitive data is exposed, but it does not contain malicious behavior by itself. The dynamic class loader relies on string inputs, which, if manipulated, could lead to code execution, but only if an attacker can control the input. The extensive use of try-except blocks is a pattern that could mask malicious activities or errors but does not in itself indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors are observed. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility code with potential security concerns mainly related to handling untrusted inputs and logging sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as utility for safe network and configuration handling, with no explicit malicious activity. However, its handling of untrusted URLs and credentials could pose security risks if misused or exploited. No malware or obfuscated code detected. The overall security risk is low but warrants cautious use in sensitive environments.",
