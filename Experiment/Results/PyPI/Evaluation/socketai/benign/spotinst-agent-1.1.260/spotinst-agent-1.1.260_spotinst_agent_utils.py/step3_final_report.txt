  "purpose": "Utility functions for HTTP requests, cloud metadata retrieval, YAML parsing, dynamic class loading, and credential management.",
  "sources": "URL endpoints, local credential files, environment variables, input parameters for network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network responses, parsed JSON data, loaded classes, credential variables, logs.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and credential files feed into request functions; responses are read and processed; credentials are read from files; class loader dynamically imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated modules (httplib, urllib2), plaintext credentials stored in fixed path, no URL validation, logging tokens and sensitive info, broad exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for cloud environment interactions and API communication. It handles network requests with exception safety, dynamically loads classes, and reads credentials from plaintext files. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration are present. The use of deprecated modules and plaintext credentials are security hygiene issues but do not imply malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are detected. The functions could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this does not constitute malware. The overall behavior is benign, serving legitimate cloud management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concerns relate to plaintext credential storage and lack of input validation, which are hygiene issues rather than malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting these hygiene issues. Overall, the code is safe but should be improved in credential handling and input validation practices.",
