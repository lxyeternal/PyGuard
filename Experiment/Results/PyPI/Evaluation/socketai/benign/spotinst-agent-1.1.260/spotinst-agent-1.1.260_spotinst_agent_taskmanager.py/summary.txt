  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with scheduling capabilities, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security risk is the trust in external modules loaded dynamically, which could be exploited if directories are compromised. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be increased to reflect the potential for supply chain attacks, with a recommended value around 0.6. Overall, the code is benign but requires operational controls to ensure directory integrity."
