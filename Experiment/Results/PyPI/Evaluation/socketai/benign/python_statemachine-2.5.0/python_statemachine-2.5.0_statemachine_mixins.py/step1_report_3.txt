{
  "purpose": "The code defines a mixin class that automatically instantiates and assigns a state machine to a model, facilitating state management.",
  "sources": "self.state_machine_name, self.state_field_name, registry.get_machine_cls(self.state_machine_name)",
  "sinks": "setattr(self, self.state_machine_attr, sm)",
  "flows": "Retrieving machine class from registry based on name -> instantiating machine class -> assigning to model attribute",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports components, defines a class with configuration attributes, and in the initializer, checks for a valid machine name, retrieves a machine class via a registry, creates an instance, and assigns it to the model. It optionally binds events as methods. All actions follow standard patterns without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a mixin to add state machine functionality to models. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
