{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a pytest fixture for injecting a custom asyncio wrapper into doctest namespaces, facilitating async testing within the pytest framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'sys' module for version info and the 'pytest' module for test setup; it also imports specific classes and functions from 'statemachine' modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send untrusted data anywhere, nor does it invoke network or system commands. It only modifies test namespace variables.",
  "flows": "The code reads system version info to decide test collection behavior, and it injects classes and functions into the doctest namespace, with no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns. The code appears to be standard test setup code with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for testing, defines a fixture to add context to doctests, and conditionally skips test collection based on Python version and project type. It uses standard practices for test setup and does not perform any network, file, or environment manipulations that are suspicious. There are no hidden backdoors, malicious payloads, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup script that injects helper classes and functions into doctest namespaces for asynchronous testing support. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
