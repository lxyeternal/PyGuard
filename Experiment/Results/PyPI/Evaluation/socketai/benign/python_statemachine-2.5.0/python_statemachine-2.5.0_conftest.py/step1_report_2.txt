{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a pytest fixture for doctest integration and controls test collection based on Python version and project name.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and pytest modules, and local modules statemachine and utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or security vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is configuration and setup logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup and control logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and testing modules, defines a fixture to inject classes into doctest namespace, and includes a function to ignore test collection based on Python version and project name. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no external network activity. The code is purely for test setup and configuration, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test setup code for pytest with no malicious or security concern. It simply enhances testing capabilities and manages test collection behavior.",
