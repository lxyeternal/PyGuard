{
  "purpose": "The code provides a pytest fixture for injecting objects into doctest namespace and controls test collection based on Python version and project path.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, pytest, and statemachine modules; usage of sys.version_info for version checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; no data leakage or malicious data processing observed.",
  "flows": "The code reads system information (Python version) and modifies test collection behavior based on conditions, with no data flowing to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward test configuration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest configuration with a fixture to add objects to the doctest namespace and a test collection ignore function based on Python version and project name. No external data, no dynamic code execution, no malicious patterns. It is typical test setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
