{
  "purpose": "This code sets up pytest fixtures and environment configurations for testing, injecting classes and functions into the doctest namespace, and conditionally skipping test collection based on Python version and project path.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, pytest, and statemachine modules; reads environment variables for Python version and project path; reads data from the imported modules and environment conditions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external network activity, or data leaks are present; the code only modifies test environment setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data or external systems; the code only manipulates test environment variables and namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements, fixture definitions, and environment checks. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest setup script that injects classes and functions into the doctest namespace for testing purposes. It conditionally skips test collection based on Python version and project path. There are no external data sources, network activity, or malicious code. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration script used for testing, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
