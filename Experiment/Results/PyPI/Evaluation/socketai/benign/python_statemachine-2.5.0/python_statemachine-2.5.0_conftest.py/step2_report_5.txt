  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports standard modules (`sys`, `pytest`) and the `statemachine` package.\n- Defines a pytest fixture (`add_doctest_context`) that injects classes (`State`, `StateMachine`) and a utility (`run_async_from_sync`) into the `doctest_namespace`.\n- Implements a function (`pytest_ignore_collect`) that skips test collection if Python version < 3.10 or if the path contains `\"django_project\"`.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or file manipulations.\n- Uses standard testing setup practices.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- The `run_async_from_sync` utility is for asynchronous test execution, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard pytest setup with no malicious or security-risk behaviors.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code performs its intended purpose without security issues.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n  All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports justify a risk score > 0.5; all are appropriate at 0.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is detected, malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they interpret the code accurately.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is purely for test setup and configuration.\n- No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The utility functions and import statements are standard and safe.\n- The conditional test skipping based on environment is common practice.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. I agree with the assessments provided, and I would maintain the scores at zero across all categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe pytest configuration snippet with no security issues.",
