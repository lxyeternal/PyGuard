{
  "purpose": "This code sets up fixtures and environment configuration for pytest testing framework, specifically adding custom objects and skipping certain collections based on Python version and project type.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system Python version, imports modules (`sys`, `pytest`, `statemachine`) and modifies the `doctest_namespace` for testing.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks. No code execution or data manipulation from untrusted sources appears to occur.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, defining fixtures, and conditionally skipping test collection based on version and path, with no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code segments are present. The code follows standard testing setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles testing setup by injecting objects into the doctest namespace and controlling test collection. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malware. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing setup for pytest, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply configures the testing environment and skips certain test collections based on environment conditions.",
