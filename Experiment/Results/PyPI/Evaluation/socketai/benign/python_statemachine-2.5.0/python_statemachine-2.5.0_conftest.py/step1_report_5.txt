{
  "purpose": "This code sets up pytest fixtures and configuration for testing, particularly injecting utilities for doctests related to the 'statemachine' library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'statemachine' and 'pytest', environment variables (sys), and code execution context via fixtures.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines test setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. Use of run_async_from_sync is for test convenience, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest configuration for testing and documentation purposes. It imports modules, defines a fixture to add context to doctests, and a function to ignore certain collections based on Python version and path. No code appears to perform any malicious activity or malicious data handling. No external network calls, file manipulations, or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is solely for testing purposes and does not include any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
