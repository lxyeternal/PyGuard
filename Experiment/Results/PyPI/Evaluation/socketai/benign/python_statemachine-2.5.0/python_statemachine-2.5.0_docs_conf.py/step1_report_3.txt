  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx, including extensions, themes, and gallery generation.",
  "sources": "Imports (os, sys, sphinx_gallery), os.getcwd(), sys.path.insert, import statements (MachineScraper, statemachine), and variables setting configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usage with sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration variables flow into the Sphinx build process; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a custom function 'dummy_write_computation_times' that overrides 'gen_gallery.write_computation_times' with an empty function; this is benign and likely a patch. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration script with extensions, theme, static paths, and gallery settings. No external data inputs are read during execution besides standard library calls. No network connections or data leaks are observed. The import of 'MachineScraper' and 'statemachine' is from the local codebase, not suspicious. The override of 'write_computation_times' is a benign patch. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical documentation configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
