  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup, including extensions, theme, and project info.",
  "sources": "Imports from sphinx_gallery, local modules, environment variables, and version info from 'statemachine'.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks; external JS URL for GitHub buttons is benign.",
  "flows": "Standard configuration flows; no untrusted data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Override of 'write_computation_times' with a dummy function; import of 'MachineScraper' from test directory.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with benign imports, external resources, and a harmless function override. The import of a test module ('tests.scrape_images') is common in development/testing environments. No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The external JS URL is for GitHub buttons and is safe. The override of 'write_computation_times' appears to be a benign customization to disable or modify behavior during documentation build.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign documentation configuration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of test modules and function overrides are typical in development contexts and do not indicate malicious intent.",
