The primary security consideration is the callback registration mechanism, which could be exploited if untrusted callbacks are registered, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the potential misuse vector without inherent malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes for a state machine, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects the minor potential for message injection if variables are untrusted, but this does not constitute a real threat. The malware score is zero, obfuscated score is zero, and overall security risk is very low."

Overall, the code is benign, and the reports' assessments are accurate."
