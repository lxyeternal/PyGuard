{
  "purpose": "Define classes and methods for managing states and transitions within a state machine, including state creation, transition definitions, and instance management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily the parameters passed to class constructors and methods such as 'name', 'value', 'initial', 'final', 'enter', 'exit', and the 'states' in transition methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include callback registration points ('enter' and 'exit'), string formatting in exceptions, and the use of callback groups and priorities which could be manipulated to alter behavior.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from method parameters (e.g., 'states', 'kwargs') can influence transition creation and callback setup, but there are no indications of untrusted data flowing into system-critical or external communication functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely standard for a state machine implementation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are evident. Use of weakref to reference states and machines is normal for avoiding circular references. The use of string formatting in exception messages is safe. Callback registration is standard, with no apparent malicious manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a state machine's core logic, including state creation, transition management, and callback handling. It uses well-structured classes, including mechanisms for state comparison, hashing, and instance-based state representations. No code injections, network communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Callbacks and transition definitions are based on user-supplied parameters, which is typical for such libraries. There are no obfuscated code patterns, suspicious external calls, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a state machine framework, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a state machine framework with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It manages states, transitions, and callbacks in a typical manner. No malicious signals, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful external communications, are detected.",
