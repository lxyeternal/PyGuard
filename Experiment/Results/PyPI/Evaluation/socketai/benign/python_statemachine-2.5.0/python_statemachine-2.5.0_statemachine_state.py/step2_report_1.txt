  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports indicate that the code is a standard implementation of a state machine framework.\n   - No external network, file, or system commands are invoked.\n   - Callbacks are user-defined and could be malicious if supplied externally, but this is typical and not inherently malicious.\n   - Use of weak references and string formatting in exceptions are standard practices.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured and logically consistent.\n   - No evident flaws or mistakes that could lead to security issues.\n   - The transition and state management mechanisms are standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9), reflecting the reviewers' consensus.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The only possible concern is the callback mechanism, which relies on user-supplied functions. If an attacker supplies malicious callbacks, it could cause harm, but this is outside the scope of this code itself.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical, well-structured state machine implementation.\n   - No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (Confirmed no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (Low, due to reliance on user-defined callbacks but no inherent vulnerabilities)\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since callback injection could be malicious if user-supplied, but this is outside the code's control)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The only caveat is the potential misuse of callbacks by external users, which is a common and accepted pattern in such frameworks.",
