{
  "purpose": "This code implements a state machine framework with classes for states, transitions, and callback management, facilitating the definition and management of states and their transitions within a state machine.",
  "sources": "User-defined callback functions for state entry and exit, state properties, and transition creation methods.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions executed upon state entry/exit; no external data or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Callbacks are invoked during state transitions; no external data flows or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. Callback registration depends on external functions, which is standard but could be misused if callbacks are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured state machine implementation. It manages states, transitions, and callbacks without external communication or system modification. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The reliance on user-supplied callbacks is typical and not inherently malicious, though it could be exploited if callbacks are malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard state machine framework with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The potential risk is limited to callback misuse, which is outside the code's control and a known pattern in such systems. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low.",
