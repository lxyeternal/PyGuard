{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and methods for a state machine framework, including states, transitions, and related utilities.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: None evident; no data leaks or system modifications are directly present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and method parameters, but no untrusted external data sources are processed or sent to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements state management with classes representing states, including special states like AnyState. Transition creation methods generate transition objects but do not perform any network or file system operations. Callbacks and internal identifiers are used for managing state behaviors but do not suggest malicious intent. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious dynamic code execution is evident. The code appears well-structured for a state machine framework without hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a state machine framework with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
