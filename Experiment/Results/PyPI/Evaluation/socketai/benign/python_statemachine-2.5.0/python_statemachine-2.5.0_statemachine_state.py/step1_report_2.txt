{
  "purpose": "Define the core classes and methods for managing states and transitions in a state machine library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, weakref), and internal modules (callbacks, exceptions, i18n, transition, transition_list). No external input sources or external data reading is apparent.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include callback execution via enter/exit callbacks, property accessors, and transition creation methods. No direct untrusted data sinks (like network, file, or env vars) are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from state definitions to transition setup; callbacks are triggered on state entry/exit. No untrusted data flow paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors is detected. The code adheres to typical class and method patterns of a state machine implementation. No unusual or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured state machine framework with classes for states, instance states, and transition builders. It manages callbacks for state entry and exit, supports transition definitions, and enforces constraints like non-overridable states. No code appears to perform external communications, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code relies on internal callback mechanisms and standard class properties without suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to implement standard state machine behavior without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical, well-structured implementation of a state machine system. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. It seems safe and consistent with its purpose.",
