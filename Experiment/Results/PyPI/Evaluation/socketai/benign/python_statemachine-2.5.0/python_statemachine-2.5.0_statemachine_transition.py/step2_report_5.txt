  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer states that the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent, no suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code. They assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.1, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n- **Logic & Validity:** The code indeed manages transitions, events, and callbacks in a typical pattern. No external data, no network, no file access, no dynamic code execution. The use of deepcopy on callback specs is safe here.\n\n- **Score Justification:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is low, considering no external data handling or code injection.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code manages internal state and callbacks, with no external data or suspicious patterns. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.\n\n- **Logic & Validity:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis finds no malicious patterns, no external system access, no suspicious code. Malware score is 0, security risk 0.1, confidence 1.\n\n- **Logic & Validity:** The code is standard for a state machine transition class.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer notes potential data manipulation in `add_event()` and callback execution, but finds no malicious intent. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Logic & Validity:** The mention of callback handling and event matching as potential sinks is valid, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) reflects cautiousness about callback handling, which could be exploited if callbacks are malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, with focus on callback management and event matching, no external data flows, no obfuscation, no suspicious activity. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Logic & Validity:** The reasoning is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, dynamic execution, or external system access.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior**. The code is a standard implementation of a state transition class, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to callback handling, which could be misused if callbacks are malicious, but no such evidence here)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured.**",
