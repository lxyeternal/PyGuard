{
  "purpose": "Defines a Transition class for managing state transitions within a state machine, including event handling and callback management.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes, method parameters, and creates instances of Events and CallbackSpecList. No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is written or sent to external systems such as network, files, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (events, callbacks) are stored in class attributes and passed to other objects (Events, CallbackSpecList). No data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages internal state and callback configurations for transitions in a state machine. It creates event objects and callback lists, with no external system interaction or security-sensitive operations. No user input is directly handled, and no external data sources or sinks are identified. The class enforces internal consistency (e.g., self-transitions for internal transitions). Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of state transition logic with callback handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a state machine transition class with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs internal management of callbacks and events without external interactions or sensitive operations.",
