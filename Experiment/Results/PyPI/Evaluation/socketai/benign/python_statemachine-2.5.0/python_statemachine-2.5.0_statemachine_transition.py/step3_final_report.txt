  "purpose": "Manage state transitions, callbacks, and events within a state machine framework, providing mechanisms for validation, callback invocation, and event matching.",
  "sources": "Initialization of self._events via Events().add(event), callback specifications via CallbackSpecList, and callback registration through grouper methods.",
  "sinks": "Callback functions stored in self.validators, self.before, self.on, self.after, and self.cond; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Event addition in __init__ via self._events.add(event); callback registration and grouping; match method for event matching; callback invocation in _setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; use of deepcopy on callback specs is standard; no dynamic code execution or external data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Transition class for state management, with validation for internal transitions, callback grouping, and event handling. It uses standard practices such as deepcopy for callback specs and internal event matching. No external data sources, network calls, or code injection mechanisms are present. The callback functions are user-defined and invoked internally, which is typical in such frameworks. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to callback execution, but no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of a state transition class with callback management. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
