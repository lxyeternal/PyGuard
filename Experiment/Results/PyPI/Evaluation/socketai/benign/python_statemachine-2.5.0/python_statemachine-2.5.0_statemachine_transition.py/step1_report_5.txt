{
  "purpose": "Defines a Transition class for managing state transitions within a state machine, including callback handling and event matching.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (copy, typing) and local modules (.callbacks, .events, .exceptions). Reads input via constructor parameters, method calls, and properties.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in callback handling (callbacks passed as arguments), event matching, and deep copying of callback specifications.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives callbacks and event descriptors, stores them, and prepares callback groups. _setup() method adds convention callbacks. match() and add_event() access internal event data. _copy_with_args() deep copies callback specs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external network activity or file operations. Callback handling appears standard. No external data sinks identified.",
  "analysis": "The class manages state transitions with associated events and callbacks. It uses internal callback groups and spec lists, supporting flexible callback registration. Event matching and copying functions are straightforward. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code structure is clear, with no unusual code patterns or obfuscation. The only potentially sensitive operations involve handling callbacks and deep copying specs, which are typical in callback-based frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing state transitions with callbacks, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform external network communication, data leakage, or suspicious operations. The security risk is minimal.",
