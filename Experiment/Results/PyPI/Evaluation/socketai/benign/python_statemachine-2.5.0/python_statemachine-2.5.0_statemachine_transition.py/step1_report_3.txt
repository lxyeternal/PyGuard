{
  "purpose": "Defines a Transition class for state machine logic, managing source/target states and associated callbacks, events, and conditions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (copy, typing, and internal project modules); uses input parameters for transition configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like event, validators, callbacks) flow into internal data structures (Events, CallbackSpecList). No external data flow or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages transition objects with callbacks, events, and validation logic. It validates that internal transitions are self-transitions, which is a typical logical check. It uses deepcopy for copying specs, and handles events and callbacks through standard patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or dangerous operations is present. All imports are standard, and there are no network or file operations. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a state transition mechanism with callback management. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the code provided.",
