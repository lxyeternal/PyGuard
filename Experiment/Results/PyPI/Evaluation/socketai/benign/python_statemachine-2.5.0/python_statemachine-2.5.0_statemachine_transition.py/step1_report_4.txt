{
  "purpose": "Defines a Transition class for a state machine framework, managing state transitions and associated callbacks.",
  "sources": "Initial import statements; class constructor parameters; internal method calls like Events().add() and CallbackSpecList() methods; property getters; add_event method.",
  "sinks": "Potential data manipulation in add_event() (though unlikely to be malicious); usage of callback functions that could execute arbitrary code if malicious; no evident network or system data access; no explicit data leaks or external calls outside method invocations.",
  "flows": "Input data (event triggers) flows into _events via add(), then matches through match(); callback specifications stored and invoked via self._specs; no external data flows outside the class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls detected. The code uses standard patterns for callback management and state transition definitions. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a state transition object with associated callback groups. It utilizes standard class methods and property accessors. No external network, file, or environment variable access occurs; callback functions are stored and invoked in a controlled manner. The use of deepcopy for copying specs is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code appears to be a typical implementation for managing state transitions with callback hooks, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a state machine framework, managing transitions and callbacks securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks within this fragment.",
