  "purpose": "Define a Transition class for a state machine framework, managing state transitions, callbacks, and events.",
  "sources": "Initialization of self._events with Events().add(event); callback group assignments via self._specs.grouper().add() for validators, before, on, after, cond.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks such as network, file system, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input event data flows into self._events, which is used for matching events; callback specifications are set up but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deepcopy on callback specifications is safe but could be unusual; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. No suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Transition class with proper validation (e.g., internal transitions are self-transitions). Event handling is managed via the Events class, and callbacks are grouped and assigned appropriately. No external data is processed insecurely, and no code injection or malicious behavior is evident. The design appears standard for state machine transitions. No network, file, or environment access is present that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a state transition with callback management. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detectable based on this code segment. It is a standard, well-structured implementation without signs of malware or security risks.",
