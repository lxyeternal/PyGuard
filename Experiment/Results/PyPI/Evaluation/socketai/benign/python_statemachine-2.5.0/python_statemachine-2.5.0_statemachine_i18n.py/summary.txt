  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe internationalization setup with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 is justified by filesystem access but does not indicate a real threat. Overall, the code is benign, and the reports' assessments are accurate."
