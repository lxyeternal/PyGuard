  "purpose": "Set up internationalization (i18n) by configuring gettext translations for the 'statemachine' domain.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine script directory; reading from 'locale' directory for translation files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data directly influences system behavior or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Path from script_dir to locale_dir, then to gettext.translation and related functions for setting up translation domain.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the script's directory, sets up a path to the 'locale' directory, and initializes gettext translation for the 'statemachine' domain. It uses standard gettext functions with fallback enabled, ensuring robust translation setup. The use of __file__ for directory resolution is typical in localizable scripts. No external inputs, user data, or sensitive information is involved. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to common internationalization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard setup of gettext for i18n purposes without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for localization configuration.",
