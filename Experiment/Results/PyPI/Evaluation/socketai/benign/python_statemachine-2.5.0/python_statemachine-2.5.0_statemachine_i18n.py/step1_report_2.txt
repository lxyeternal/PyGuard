  "purpose": "Set up internationalization (i18n) support by loading translation files for the 'statemachine' domain.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine script directory; accessing 'locale' directory relative to script location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only sets up translation functions without handling external input or output.",
  "flows": "Path from script directory detection to configuring gettext translation, returning the translation function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed; standard i18n setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the script's directory, sets the path for locale files, and initializes gettext translation with fallback support. It then binds the text domain and sets it for future translation calls, returning the gettext function. No user input, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical internationalization setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and standard.",
