  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states that the code is a straightforward class managing State objects, including creation from enums, with no malicious behavior. It correctly notes the absence of network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Given the code's nature, these scores seem reasonable. The low security risk score aligns with the lack of external interactions or vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the safe construction of State objects from enums, with no external data leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score, which is appropriate given the absence of any suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Focuses on internal management of State objects, creation from enums, and attribute access. It notes no malicious behaviors or external data flows.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The low risk score matches the analysis; no issues detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, confirming the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of external effects.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, describes a benign utility for state management with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** Zero risk and malware scores are justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns, which is appropriate given the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, aligned with the absence of external threats or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
