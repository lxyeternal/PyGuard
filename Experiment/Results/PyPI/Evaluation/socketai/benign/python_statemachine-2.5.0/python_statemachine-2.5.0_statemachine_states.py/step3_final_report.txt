{
  "purpose": "This code defines a States class that manages a collection of State objects, with functionality to create states from enum types, access states via attributes, and modify the collection. It facilitates building state machines by converting enums into State instances.",
  "sources": "Enum members in the from_enum method, initial and final state parameters provided during method call.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Enum members are converted into State objects within the from_enum method; internal state collection is manipulated via append and attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated typing imports (Dict, Type), but this is not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility class for managing states in a state machine framework. It converts enum members into State objects, supports attribute-based access, and allows appending new states. There are no external data flows, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The use of deprecated typing imports indicates outdated practices but not security issues. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured and intended for internal logic, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for state management within a state machine framework. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
