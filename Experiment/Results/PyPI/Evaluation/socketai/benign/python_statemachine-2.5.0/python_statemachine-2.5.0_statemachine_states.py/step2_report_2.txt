  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a class for managing states, including creation from enum types, with standard methods for access and manipulation.\n- No network, file, or external communication code is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n- Usage of deprecated typing imports is noted but not malicious.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with low security risk and malware scores.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; no external data sources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Reasonable, given the code is straightforward.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The low score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; the enum_type parameter is the main data source.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no external or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Note:** The low risk score reflects minimal security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Additional note:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no external data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Note:** Slightly higher risk score, but still low.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Perfectly aligned with the benign assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally very low (0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, primarily due to deprecated typing imports, which are not security issues but may indicate outdated practices)\n\n---\n\n### Final Remarks:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard utility class for state management, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1            |\n\nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.",
