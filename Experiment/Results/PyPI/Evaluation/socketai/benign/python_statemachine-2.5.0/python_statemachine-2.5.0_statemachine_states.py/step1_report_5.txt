{
  "purpose": "Defines a collection of State objects and provides methods for creating states from enums, used in state machine configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class method 'from_enum', and attribute access within the class.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no code takes untrusted input or writes data outside expected structures.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code primarily constructs State objects from enum values; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, with clear type annotations, docstrings, and straightforward logic for creating states from enums. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. Usage of deprecated typing import does not introduce security issues. The method 'from_enum' only processes enum members to create State instances. No input/output handling indicates potential data leaks or injection risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing states in a state machine, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and focused solely on state management.",
