{
  "purpose": "The code defines a TransitionList class for managing a collection of Transition objects with callback functionalities, likely used in a state machine or workflow framework.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters such as transitions, event, and transition objects' attributes like transition.events.",
  "sinks": "Calls to methods like add_event, add_transitions, and _add_unbounded_callback that could potentially invoke callbacks or modify transition state, but are contained within the class.",
  "flows": "Transitions are added or manipulated via add_transitions and add_event methods, which modify internal transition objects; callbacks may be registered through _add_callback.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of dynamic features appears standard. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured container for Transition objects, supporting addition, combination, and event management. It uses type hints and assertions for type safety. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The methods interact with other classes (Transition, CallbackGroup) in a manner consistent with event-driven architectures. No external data sources or sinks pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured component for managing state transitions and callbacks, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
