  "conclusion": "The code is benign and well-structured, serving as a transition management utility. The primary security consideration is the callback registration mechanism, which could be exploited if untrusted callbacks are registered, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the potential misuse vector without inherent malicious intent."
