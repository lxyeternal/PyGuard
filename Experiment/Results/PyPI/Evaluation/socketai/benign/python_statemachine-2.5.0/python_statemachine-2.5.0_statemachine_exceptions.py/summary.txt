  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes for a state machine, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects the minor potential for message injection if variables are untrusted, but this does not constitute a real threat. The malware score is zero, obfuscated score is zero, and overall security risk is very low."
