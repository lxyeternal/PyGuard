  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for a state machine system, providing error handling and messaging.",
  "sources": "Internal variables such as 'value', 'event.name', 'state.name' used in exception message formatting.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages generated from internal variables; no external data or system effects.",
  "flows": "Construction of exception objects with formatted messages from internal variables; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with variables that could potentially originate from untrusted sources, but these are internal and used solely for error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class, with message formatting using internal variables. No external data sources, network calls, or file I/O are present. The use of the localization function '_' is standard. The message formatting involves variables like 'value', 'event.name', and 'state.name', which could be untrusted if derived from external inputs, but in typical usage within a controlled system, this is safe. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external effects. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in one report is justified by the potential for message injection if input is untrusted, but overall, the code is standard error handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception classes for a state machine, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects the minor potential for message injection if variables are untrusted, but this does not constitute a real threat. The malware score is zero, obfuscated score is zero, and overall security risk is very low.",
