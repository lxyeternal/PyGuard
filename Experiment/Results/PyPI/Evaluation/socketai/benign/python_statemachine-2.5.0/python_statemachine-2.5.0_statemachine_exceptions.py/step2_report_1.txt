  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines custom exceptions with no external data flow, no malicious behavior, and uses standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the code is purely for error handling.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with no external data flow or malicious activity. Use of localization function _ is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; straightforward exception class definitions.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Exception messages are formatted with input parameters, but these are internal variables, not untrusted external data. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** No security risk; message formatting is standard for exceptions.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, with message formatting involving input data. Slightly higher confidence that this is standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight increase in securityRisk is acceptable given the context.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or behavior; just standard exception handling with message formatting.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** No external data, no suspicious patterns, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (error handling classes), the risk is inherently low. The slight securityRisk=0.1 in Report 4 is reasonable due to message formatting involving potentially variable data, but it does not pose a real threat.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code is a typical, secure implementation of custom exceptions for a state machine system.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal concern about message formatting with input data, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is clean, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The slight securityRisk score is justified but does not indicate any real threat.",
