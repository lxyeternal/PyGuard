{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for state machine error handling and validation.",
  "sources": "None (standard class definitions, string formatting, and import statements).",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only defines classes and exceptions without data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes custom exception classes with some use of string formatting for error messages, utilizing the '_' function for localization. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external communications. The use of the TYPE_CHECKING import is standard for type hints and does not impact runtime behavior. The class constructors store parameters but do not perform any malicious actions. No code injection, data leakage, or system manipulation appears present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of class definitions for exception handling related to a state machine. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
