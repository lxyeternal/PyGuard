  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for a state machine system, including error handling for invalid states, definitions, and transitions.",
  "sources": "Constants, imported modules (_ from i18n), exception messages, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and attribute access, which are standard and do not lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Construction of exception objects with formatted messages, but no data flows from untrusted sources; no external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internationalization function _ for messages is standard; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with typical message formatting for error reporting. The only dynamic content involves formatting error messages using class attributes and the _ function. There are no input sources, external data flows, or suspicious constructs. The code appears purely for error handling within a state machine system, with no malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a state machine. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
