  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes with message formatting, using class attributes and the localization function `_()`.\n- No external data sources, network, file I/O, or untrusted inputs are involved.\n- Exception messages are constructed from internal parameters, which are not user input or external data.\n- The code appears to be standard for error handling in a state machine context.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, straightforward exception classes, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception classes, no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with message formatting from input parameters, no external data sources.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with dynamic message formatting, but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is very low, justified by the fact that message formatting involves potentially untrusted data, but since these are internal exception messages, the risk is minimal. No malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Basic class definitions, no external data, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware presence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since the only dynamic data involved is in exception message formatting, which is internal and not executed or transmitted, the risk remains very low. The only slightly elevated score (0.1) in report 4 is justified.\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no external data, no dangerous operations)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for a state machine, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
