{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for a state machine implementation, including error handling for invalid definitions, states, and transitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, local modules i18n, event, and state; usage of _ for translation.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or database operations.",
  "flows": "No flows involving untrusted data leading to potential harm; exception messages are constructed from internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. Use of translation function _ for messages is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and a base class. It uses type hints and conditional imports for type checking. Exception messages include dynamic content, but they are generated from internal variables and translation functions, not user input. No code executes external commands, writes to network, or handles untrusted data. No obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured exception class definitions for a state machine system. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not perform any dangerous operations or data leaks.",
