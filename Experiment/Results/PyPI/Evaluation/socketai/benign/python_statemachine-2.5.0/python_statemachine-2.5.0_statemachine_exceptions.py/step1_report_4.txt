{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a state machine, including error handling for invalid states, definitions, and transitions.",
  "sources": "Reads type annotations, import statements, and localized string formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting with potentially untrusted data (`value`, `event.name`, `state.name`) in exception messages.",
  "flows": "Input (value, event.name, state.name) -> formatted message -> exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no network or file operations, no obfuscated code. Use of localization function `_()` is standard for internationalization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for a state machine framework, utilizing standard Python features. The only dynamic element involves formatting error messages with variables, which are derived from the input parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system calls. The use of `_()` suggests internationalization support, not malicious obfuscation. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a state machine context. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only potential concern is the formatting of messages with external data, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
