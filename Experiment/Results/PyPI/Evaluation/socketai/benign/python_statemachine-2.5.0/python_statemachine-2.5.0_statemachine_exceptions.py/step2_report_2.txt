  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes for a state machine.\n- Uses standard Python features: class inheritance, string formatting, optional type hints.\n- Exception messages are generated via formatted strings, often using class attributes or parameters.\n- The internationalization function `_()` is used, which is standard for localization.\n- No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or system commands.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Risks:\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**\n- The code appears clean, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Dynamic message formatting uses internal variables, not untrusted user input directly.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only slight concern is the use of string formatting with parameters like `value`, `event.name`, `state.name`. If these are derived from untrusted sources, in some contexts, they could be vectors for injection or log forging. However, since these are exception messages, the risk is minimal, especially if the inputs are controlled within the system.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|----------|\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external data flow. |\n| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Same reasoning; purely exception class definitions. |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | No external data or malicious activity. |\n| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | Slightly higher security risk score due to message formatting with potentially untrusted data, but still minimal. No malware or obfuscation. |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | No issues, straightforward class definitions. |\n\n**Scores above 0.5 justification:**\n- None of the reports warrant a score higher than 0.5. The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal potential for message injection if parameters are untrusted, but this is a common pattern in exception handling.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any malicious operations.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- No obfuscation detected. All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. The slight variation in the fourth report's security risk score (0.1) is justified by the mention of message formatting with input data, though it's not a significant concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Aspect | Score | Justification |\n|---------|--------|----------------|\n| Malware | 0 | No malicious activity observed. |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | Clear, straightforward code. |\n| Security Risk | 0 | No external data flow, no system calls, minimal risk. |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is standard exception class definitions for a state machine system, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor concern about message formatting with potentially untrusted data does not justify a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The overall security posture of this code fragment is very low risk.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown of any specific report or further analysis.",
