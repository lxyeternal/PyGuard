  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details provided, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exceptions for a state machine system.\n- Source: Constants, imported modules, exception messages, class attributes.\n- Sink: Exception messages and attribute access—standard, no external effects.\n- Flow: Construction of exception objects with formatted messages; no untrusted data sources.\n- Anomalies: Use of _ for i18n is standard; no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- Analysis: Exception classes with message formatting from internal variables; no external data or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Straightforward error handling code, no risks.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Custom exceptions for state machine errors.\n- Source: Imports, use of _ for translation.\n- Sink: No direct untrusted data sinks.\n- Flow: No untrusted data flow; messages from internal variables.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code; standard use of _.\n- Analysis: Defines exception classes with message formatting; no external data or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No security risks; standard exception definitions.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes with error handling.\n- Source: Type annotations, import statements, parameters.\n- Sink: String formatting with potentially untrusted data (`value`, `event.name`, `state.name`).\n- Flow: Data from parameters into exception messages.\n- Anomalies: No malicious code or secrets; use of _ is standard.\n- Analysis: Dynamic message formatting from input parameters; no external input sources like network or file I/O.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior; standard exception classes.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes with error messages.\n- Source: Type annotations, imports, localization.\n- Sink: String formatting with variables (`value`, `event.name`, `state.name`).\n- Flow: Input parameters into messages.\n- Anomalies: No malicious code; use of _ is standard.\n- Analysis: Similar to above; formatting with input data, but no external or malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: No risks; standard exception definitions.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.1 (slightly higher due to message formatting with external data).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for validation.\n- Source: Class definitions, string formatting, import statements.\n- Sink: None, no external data processing.\n- Flow: Not applicable.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Simple class definitions; no data flow or external interaction.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity or risks.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same code fragment, which is just class definitions for exceptions with message formatting.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only slight concern is the formatting of exception messages with input parameters (`value`, `event.name`, `state.name`). However, these are internal variables, not user input or external data sources, and are used solely for error reporting.\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n  - Security risk scores are generally 0, with one report at 0.1 due to message formatting — still not indicative of a security threat.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is standard exception class definitions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor concern is the use of formatted strings with potentially untrusted data, but since these are internal variables, this does not constitute a security issue.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, related to message formatting, but not a security threat)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks or malware threats. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is benign.",
