{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a state machine system, including error handling for invalid definitions, states, and transitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, imported localization function '_', and exception initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for exception messages using potentially untrusted data (values, event names, state names).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (value, event.name, state.name) into formatted exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of localization function _ without external data, but that is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with constructors that format messages using input parameters. No external input sources such as network or file I/O are present. The only potential concern is the use of string formatting with input data, but in this context, it is for exception messages and not a security risk. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or supply chain attacks are detected. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for error handling within a state machine module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for a state machine, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input formatting for exception messages but does not process untrusted data in a manner that would constitute a security threat.",
