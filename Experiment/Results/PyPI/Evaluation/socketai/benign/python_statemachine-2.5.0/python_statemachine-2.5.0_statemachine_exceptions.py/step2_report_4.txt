  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions for a state machine, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code uses standard exception classes, message formatting, and localization functions. No external data sources or external effects are involved.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the absence of external data sinks or malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No untrusted data handling, no external communication, standard exception class definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with message formatting from input parameters; no external data sources or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** The main concern is the formatting of exception messages using input parameters (`value`, `event.name`, `state.name`). While these are internal variables, if they are derived from untrusted sources, they could potentially lead to issues like log injection or information leakage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The small security risk score reflects the potential for message injection or leakage if input is untrusted.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. The code itself isn't malicious but could pose minor security concerns if input isn't sanitized.\n\n**Verdict:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is justified given the potential for untrusted data in exception messages. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with standard exception class definitions and message formatting.\n- **Analysis:** The report notes that message formatting involves potentially untrusted data, but considers this standard practice. The risk is minimal unless the input is maliciously crafted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. This is consistent with the previous report.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Class definitions with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes the absence of data leaks, external communication, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The assessment aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions.\n- The only minor concern relates to the formatting of exception messages with potentially untrusted data, which is a common pattern but can pose security risks if the data is untrusted.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential message injection if input is untrusted)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is standard, with a very low potential security concern regarding message formatting.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for a state machine, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minor security risk score reflects the possibility of untrusted data in exception messages, but this is standard and manageable. No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
