  "purpose": "Graph traversal utility functions for automaton or state machine processing.",
  "sources": "Initial state parameter in visit_connected_states; state.transitions attribute in both functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Input state flows into the while loop in visit_connected_states; state.transitions accessed in both functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard BFS traversal and generator functions over a graph-like structure. It does not process external input beyond initial parameters, nor does it perform network, file, or system operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is clear, simple, and typical for automaton traversal. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is unjustified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of graph traversal functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency, and malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0.",
