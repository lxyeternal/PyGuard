  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of graph traversal functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency, and malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0."
