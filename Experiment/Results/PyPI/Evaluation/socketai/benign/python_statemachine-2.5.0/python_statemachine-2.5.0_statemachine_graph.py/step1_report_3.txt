{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for traversing connected states and iterating over states and their transitions, likely for graph or automaton processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'state' in visit_connected_states; 'states' list in iterate_states_and_transitions.",
  "sinks": "Yield statements, which could pass data downstream but are benign in this context.",
  "flows": "From input 'state' or 'states' through iteration and yield statements, no data is sent externally or manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two generator functions: one performs a breadth-first traversal over connected states, and the other yields each state and its transitions. The logic appears straightforward, with standard use of collections and iteration. No data leakage, external communication, or suspicious activity detected. No obfuscation or malicious patterns present. The code serves as a traversal utility within a larger system, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign traversal utility for processing states and their transitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious payloads within this code segment.",
