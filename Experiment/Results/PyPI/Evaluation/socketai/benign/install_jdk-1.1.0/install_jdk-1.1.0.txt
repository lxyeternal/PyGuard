      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign client for Azul's Zulu distribution API. It performs expected functions without malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external URL reliance, which is standard for such tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the reports and code behavior."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate resource URL builder for Corretto SDKs, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only notable risk stems from reliance on external JSON data, which is from a trusted source. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to external dependency. Implementing JSON integrity verification could further enhance security, but as-is, the code is safe."

The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0, and the risk score should be low (~0.1). All reports are consistent and accurate."

The main security concern is minimal URL validation, which could be improved to prevent SSRF. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low, with a score around 0.2, but the potential for URL-based exploits warrants cautious handling."
