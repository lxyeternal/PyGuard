  "purpose": "Utility for safely extracting various archive formats (.tar, .tar.gz, .zip, .7z) with path traversal protections.",
  "sources": "Archive files read from filesystem via file path inputs.",
  "sinks": "Extraction functions that write files to the destination directory.",
  "flows": "File input -> format detection -> safe extraction with path validation -> extraction to destination -> post-processing directory selection.",
  "anomalies": "Uses lzma_open() to handle .7z files, which is incorrect since .7z archives are not handled by the lzma module; this is a misuse of the library.",
  "analysis": "The code performs archive extraction with security checks against path traversal. The main concern is the handling of .7z files via lzma_open(), which is inappropriate and likely to cause errors. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The repeated pattern across reports confirms that the misuse is a technical flaw rather than malicious intent. The extraction logic itself is standard and secure, with the primary issue being the incorrect archive handling method.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for safe archive extraction with a consistent flaw in handling .7z files using lzma_open(). There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The main risk is potential errors due to incorrect format handling, not malicious activity.",
