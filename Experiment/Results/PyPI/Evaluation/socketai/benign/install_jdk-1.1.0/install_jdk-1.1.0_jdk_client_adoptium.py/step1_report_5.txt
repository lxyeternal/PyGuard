  "purpose": "Define enums, classes, and methods for handling Adoptium Java SDK package details, including URL generation for downloads.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as version, operating_system, arch, jre, c_lib, project; environment variable for base URL.",
  "sinks": "URL construction in get_download_url method, which generates download URLs based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are processed and used to construct URLs (sinks) within get_download_url, with conditional modifications based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. Code structure and usage appear standard for SDK configuration and URL generation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums for various configuration options and a client class for generating download URLs. The URL construction appears straightforward, with no evident dynamic code execution or malicious data exfiltration. Usage of environment variables and parameters is consistent with standard SDK practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the conditional URL modification based on inputs, which is typical for URL parameterization.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard URL generator for Adoptium SDK packages with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate SDK component for constructing download links based on user-supplied parameters. No malware or security risks are identified.",
