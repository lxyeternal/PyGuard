  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the original code snippet.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom jdk.client.adoptium import AdoptiumClient\n\n# Must be kept at the bottom of the init file to ensure proper vendor loading\nfrom jdk.client.client import load_client\nfrom jdk.client.corretto import CorrettoClient\nfrom jdk.client.zulu import ZuluClient\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports describe the code as only containing import statements for vendor-specific JDK modules.\n- The comment about load order is consistent across reports.\n- No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity is mentioned.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- All reports assign very high confidence (mostly 1, some 0.9), indicating they find no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n- **Presence of code issues:** All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Malware & security risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated code:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** All are near 0, with minor exceptions like 0.1 in one report, which is acceptable given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions; it only imports modules.\n- The comment about load order is standard practice and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity.\n- The modules seem to be standard vendor SDKs, not malicious packages.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- No changes needed; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (benign import statements, no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for vendor-specific JDK modules, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The load order comment is standard and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.",
