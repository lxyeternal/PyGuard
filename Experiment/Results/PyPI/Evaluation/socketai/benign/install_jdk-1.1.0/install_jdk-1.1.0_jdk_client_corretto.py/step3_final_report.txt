{
  "purpose": "The code is a client utility for fetching a JSON index map from a static URL and constructing download URLs for Corretto SDKs based on environment and parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as version, operating system, architecture, and environment; it fetches JSON data from a remote URL via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the constructed URL returned for download, which depends on the fetched JSON data; no other data leaks or insecure actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (version, OS, architecture, environment) influence the URL construction via the JSON index map fetched from the remote URL, forming the final download URL.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typos in variable names ('architecure', 'versrion') are present but do not impact security; the method _get_resource references an undefined attribute, which could cause runtime errors if invoked.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches a JSON index map from a static, trusted URL and uses it to build download URLs for Corretto SDKs. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The reliance on external JSON data introduces a supply chain risk, but the URL is from a reputable source (GitHub). The typos are superficial and do not affect logic. The method _get_resource appears broken due to an undefined attribute but is unused. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is the external data dependency, which is standard but should be monitored for integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate resource URL builder for Corretto SDKs, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only notable risk stems from reliance on external JSON data, which is from a trusted source. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to external dependency. Implementing JSON integrity verification could further enhance security, but as-is, the code is safe.",
