  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate resource URL builder for Corretto SDKs, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only notable risk stems from reliance on external JSON data, which is from a trusted source. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to external dependency. Implementing JSON integrity verification could further enhance security, but as-is, the code is safe."
