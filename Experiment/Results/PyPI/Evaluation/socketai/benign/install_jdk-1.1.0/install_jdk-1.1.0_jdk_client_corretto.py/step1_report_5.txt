  "purpose": "This code provides a client to access and retrieve download URLs for Amazon Corretto Java SDKs based on system environment, architecture, and version.",
  "sources": "URL from which JSON index map is fetched (_INDEX_MAP_URL). Data read from the URL in load_index_map method.",
  "sinks": "The URL formed in get_download_url method which constructs download URLs using data from the index map.",
  "flows": "load_index_map fetches JSON data from URL, storing it in a class variable. get_download_url uses this index map and user-specified parameters to build a resource URL, which could be used to download files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external URL for index map fetch could be exploited if the URL were compromised; however, it is a known URL. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident. The code includes standard practices for URL and data handling. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumerations for system attributes, a resource builder class for constructing URLs, and a client class to fetch an index map and generate download URLs. The load_index_map method fetches JSON data over HTTPS, which is standard. The get_download_url method constructs URLs based on user input and fetched data, with proper parameter handling. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. The use of a remote URL for index map is typical for dynamic resource fetching. The code appears to be a legitimate SDK component with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard client implementation for managing and constructing download URLs for Corretto SDKs. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It operates as intended for its purpose with safe data handling practices.",
