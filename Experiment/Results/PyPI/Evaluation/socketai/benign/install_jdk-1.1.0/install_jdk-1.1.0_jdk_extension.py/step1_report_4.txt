  "purpose": "Utility functions for extending enums and marking functions or classes as deprecated",
  "sources": "Import statements and function definitions that read no external input but set up decorators and enum extension logic",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data; it primarily manages code warnings and enum manipulations",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code involves internal enum handling and warning issuance",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for extending enum classes and marking functions/classes as deprecated. It manipulates enum members and issues warnings without executing external or sensitive operations. No external input handling, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code's structure and behavior align with standard utility functions, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be safe, intended for enum extension and deprecation warnings without malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
