  "purpose": "Utility functions for extending enums, detecting deprecation, and handling annotations in Python, primarily for code management and versioning.",
  "sources": "None identified; no input sources or external data reads; functions operate on in-memory objects and decorators.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks; no untrusted data handling or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no external data flow or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code features such as decorators, warnings, and type checks are typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several decorators for extending enum classes, marking functions/classes as deprecated, and handling type annotations. The extend functions merge enum members, and the deprecated decorator issues warnings when deprecated functions/classes are called. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are apparent. The code relies on standard Python features and third-party enum classes without any obfuscation or harmful patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code for enum extension and deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
