{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for extending Enum classes, marking functions or classes as deprecated, and handling different enum types with decorators.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules and custom enum classes from 'jdk.enums'. No external or untrusted input sources are directly used within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, file access, or system modification based on untrusted input. The warnings module is used for deprecation warnings, but this is standard practice.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve applying decorators to classes/functions, extending enum classes, and issuing warnings. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors, are evident. The code appears to be utility functions for enum management and deprecation warnings, which are common and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for extending enum classes and marking functions/classes as deprecated. It uses standard Python modules and practices, with no indication of malicious intent. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or system modification is present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility decorators for enum extension and deprecation warnings. It appears benign and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use as part of a larger project.",
