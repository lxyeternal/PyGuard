{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for extending Python Enum classes, handling deprecation warnings, and managing enum extensions with support for detectability features.",
  "sources": "The code reads from Enum classes, function and class objects, and warning messages.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure use of warnings (but generally benign), and dynamic extension of enum classes.",
  "flows": "Enum class data flows into extension functions, which modify or create new enum classes; deprecation decorators issue warnings when functions or classes are called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard enum extension and deprecation warning logic. No suspicious network activity, file access, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators for extending enums (BaseEnum, BaseDetectableEnum) and handling deprecation warnings. The enum extension functions combine enum members from parent and extended classes. The deprecation decorator issues warnings upon function or class invocation. No unsafe or malicious behavior detected. No data leakage, code injection, or system manipulation observed. All operations are standard utility functions with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility library for enum extension and deprecation warnings. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. It is safe for use and does not pose security risks.",
