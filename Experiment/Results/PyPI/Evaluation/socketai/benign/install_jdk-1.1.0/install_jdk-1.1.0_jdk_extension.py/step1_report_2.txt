{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for extending Enum classes, detecting deprecation, and marking functions or classes as deprecated.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class definitions, and type hints.",
  "sinks": "Uses warnings.warn to generate deprecation warnings; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., parent classes, reasons for deprecation) flow through wrapper functions to warnings.warn, which issues warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. No obfuscated code. Use of dynamic features like warnings and decorators is standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to extend Enum classes and detect deprecated functions or classes. It constructs new Enum types by merging parent and extended enums, which is typical metaprogramming. The 'deprecated' decorator issues warnings when deprecated functions or classes are called, with flexible handling of string or callable arguments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The use of warnings is standard for deprecation notices and does not pose security risks. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility decorators and functions for extending enums and marking code as deprecated. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard, benign operations related to code maintenance and enhancement.",
