  "purpose": "Utility functions for extending Python Enum classes and handling deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; uses standard Python features and warnings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions; purely internal utility functions.",
  "flows": "N/A – functions perform enum merging and warnings without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enum extension decorators and a deprecation warning decorator. It merges enum members and issues warnings when deprecated functions or classes are called. No malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation detected. The use of warnings and dynamic enum extension is standard and benign. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for enum extension and deprecation warnings. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
