  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for enum extension and deprecation warnings.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Standard enum extension and warning logic.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low, justified by minimal risk from warnings or enum manipulations).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar utility functions for enum extension and deprecation.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, standard use of warnings.\n- Analysis: Typical metaprogramming, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 (appropriate).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for enum extension and deprecation.\n- Findings: No external data leaks, no malicious code, standard practices.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behaviors.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Findings: No malicious activity, no external system access, standard warnings.\n- Analysis: Typical utility functions.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for enum extension and deprecation.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity, no malicious code, standard patterns.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The code is purely utility functions related to enum handling and deprecation warnings. **Malware score should be 0.0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard Python features. No obfuscation detected. **Obfuscated score should be 0.0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The code's risk is minimal; it involves enum manipulation and warnings, which are benign. The only slight concern is misuse of warnings, but that does not constitute a security risk. Therefore, a risk score of **0.0 or very close to it** is appropriate. The first report's 0.1 is slightly high given the benign nature; I would recommend **0.0**.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility library for enum extension and deprecation warnings, with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk features.",
