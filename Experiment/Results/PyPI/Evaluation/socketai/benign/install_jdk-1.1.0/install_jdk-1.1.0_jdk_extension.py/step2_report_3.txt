  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for enum extension and deprecation warnings.\n- Findings: No malicious activity, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- Justification: The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score of 0 aligns with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar utility functions for enum extension and deprecation.\n- Findings: No malicious activity, standard use of warnings, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0\n- Justification: The zero scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, standard utility functions.\n- Findings: No suspicious behavior, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- Justification: Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for enum extension and deprecation.\n- Findings: No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- Justification: Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for enum extension and deprecation.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, standard practices.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- Justification: Consistent.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor point is Report 1's risk score of 0.1, which is slightly above zero. Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 would be more appropriate.\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0 in all reports, reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscation scores are also correctly 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard utility library for enum extension and deprecation warnings. It does not pose security risks or contain malicious behavior. The current scoring aligns well with the analysis, with only a slight adjustment needed for the risk score in Report 1.",
