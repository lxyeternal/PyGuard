  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for downloading and managing vendor-specific JDK files. The main security concern is minimal URL validation, which could be improved to prevent SSRF. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low, with a score around 0.2, but the potential for URL-based exploits warrants cautious handling."
