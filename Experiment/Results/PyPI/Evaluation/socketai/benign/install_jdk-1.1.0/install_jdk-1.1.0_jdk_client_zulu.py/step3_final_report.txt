{
  "purpose": "Client for Azul's Zulu API to fetch download URLs based on specified parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and detection data from system and environment detection functions; constructs URL query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP GET request to external API endpoint to retrieve JSON data containing download URL.",
  "flows": "Constructs URL with parameters -> Sends request via urlopen -> Receives JSON response -> Parses JSON to extract 'url' field.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden secrets; straightforward URL construction and data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client that detects system and architecture info, constructs a URL with parameters, and fetches a JSON response to obtain a download link. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. Network interactions are typical for such clients, and error handling is appropriate. The code relies on external API responses, but this is expected and does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is clear, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign client for Azul's Zulu distribution API. It performs expected functions without malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external URL reliance, which is standard for such tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the reports and code behavior.",
