  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report states the code is a legitimate client for Azul's API, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. It correctly notes that the network call is straightforward and based on user input, with no evidence of data exfiltration or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (low)  \n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The reasoning is sound. The code performs standard API interaction, with no suspicious patterns. The low security risk score seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code constructs URLs based on user/system parameters and fetches data via `urlopen`. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. External URL fetches are typical for such clients, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, the code constructs URLs, fetches JSON data, and returns download links. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only concern is reliance on external URLs, which is standard.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The reasoning is consistent. The external data source is presumed legitimate, and no malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a typical API client with system detection and URL fetching. No malicious code or obfuscation detected. External URL reliance is standard.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The reasoning is valid. The code's purpose and behavior are benign.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, the code constructs URLs, fetches JSON, and returns download links. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2  \n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The reasoning is consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, considering external URL fetches based on user/system input, but nothing indicates a high risk.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on thorough review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard API client for fetching download URLs, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The external URL calls are typical for such functionality and do not constitute a security threat in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
