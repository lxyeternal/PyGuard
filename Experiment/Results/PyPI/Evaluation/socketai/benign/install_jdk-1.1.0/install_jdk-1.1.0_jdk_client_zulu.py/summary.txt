  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign client for Azul's Zulu distribution API. It performs expected functions without malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external URL reliance, which is standard for such tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the reports and code behavior."
