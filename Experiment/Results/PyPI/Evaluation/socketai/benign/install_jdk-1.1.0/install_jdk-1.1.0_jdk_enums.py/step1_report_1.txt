  "purpose": "Define various enumeration classes for system and environment detection, including methods for detection and transformation.",
  "sources": "Platform, sys modules used in detection methods to identify architecture and operating system.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions involve handling untrusted user input, nor do they write data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Detection methods invoke platform-specific modules to determine system properties, with no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code primarily consists of enum definitions and simple detection logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enumeration classes with methods to detect system architecture and operating system. These methods rely on standard platform and sys modules for system information. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious functionality. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The detection methods are typical for environment detection purposes, and no sensitive data is accessed or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enumeration setup with environment detection functions using standard Python modules. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code is safe for use.",
