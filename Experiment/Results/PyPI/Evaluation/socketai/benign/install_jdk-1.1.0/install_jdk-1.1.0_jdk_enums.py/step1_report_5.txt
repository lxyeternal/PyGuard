{
  "purpose": "Define base classes and enumerations for system and environment detection, including architecture, OS, and image types.",
  "sources": "Import statements for platform and sys modules; class methods that access system info",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified",
  "flows": "System info functions (detect methods) read system properties to determine architecture and OS",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic system information retrieval is normal; no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Enum subclasses with detection and transformation methods. The detect methods import platform and sys modules and query system properties to identify architecture and OS. No external inputs, network communications, or data leaks are present. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It primarily provides environment detection functionality with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard environment detection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses system information to classify architecture and OS but does not perform any harmful actions.",
