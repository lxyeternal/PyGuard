  "purpose": "Define various enumerations and detection mechanisms for system environment properties such as architecture, operating system, and image type.",
  "sources": "Import statements, platform and sys modules used within detection methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or external output functions.",
  "flows": "Detection methods acquire data from platform/system modules; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within methods (e.g., 'from platform import machine') but no suspicious or obfuscated code; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Detection methods rely solely on system info, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumerations for system properties with detection methods for architecture and operating system. The detection functions query system modules and perform straightforward comparisons. No external data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any code injection or malicious payloads. The dynamic imports are benign and typical for such detection routines. The overall structure is clean and appears to be a standard environment detection utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured enumeration setup for environment detection without any malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
