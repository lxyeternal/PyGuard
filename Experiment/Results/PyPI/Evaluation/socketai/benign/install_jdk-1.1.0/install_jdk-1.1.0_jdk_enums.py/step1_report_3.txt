{
  "purpose": "This code defines enumerations and detection methods for system environments, architectures, and image types, likely used for environment configuration or system introspection.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform and sys modules in the detect methods of Architecture and OperatingSystem classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow paths leading to untrusted data handling, external calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source functions call platform and sys modules to detect system properties, but these are read-only system introspections without data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code adheres to standard enumeration and system detection patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to detect system architecture and OS type, encapsulated within classes that extend Enum. The detection methods perform simple string comparisons on system-reported values, which is typical for environment detection. No untrusted inputs, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and uses common patterns for environment detection without any malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign environment and system enumeration utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies solely on standard library calls for system introspection and does not perform any harmful actions.",
