{
  "purpose": "Defines environment-related enums and detection methods for system architecture, OS, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via platform and sys modules within detection methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "System info functions (platform, sys) provide data used in detection methods; no external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The __contains__ method override in BaseEnum is non-standard but harmless; no malicious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum classes with detection methods relying on standard Python modules for environment detection. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or data leaks are present. The dynamic imports are benign. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All detection logic is standard and safe. The __contains__ override is non-standard but does not introduce security issues. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0. The code is safe for use in environment detection contexts.",
