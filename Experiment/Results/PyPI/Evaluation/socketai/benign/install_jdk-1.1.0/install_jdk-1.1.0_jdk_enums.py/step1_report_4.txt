  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for system properties and their detection logic.",
  "sources": "import statements, platform detection functions, sys.maxsize, sys.platform, platform module functions, class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Detection methods (detect) use system info to determine environment attributes, but do not process untrusted input or data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic system info detection is standard; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The __contains__ method override may be non-standard but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines enums with some detection logic for system architecture and operating system. The detection functions import system modules and check platform strings, which is typical. No input or data processing is performed that could lead to injection or leakage. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with standard enum usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of enum definitions with system property detection methods. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears to be safe and intended for environment configuration purposes.",
