{
  "purpose": "A test tile source generating images with optional fractal patterns, color bands, and annotations for visualization or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters such as minLevel, maxLevel, frames, bands, and internal regex parsing for bands.",
  "sinks": "Produces image tiles via PIL and numpy; no external data transmission, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Parameters influence internal image generation; no external untrusted data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Complex regex parsing for bands but no malicious intent; hardcoded font path is typical; no secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for generating test images with fractal and color features. It uses standard libraries, no network or system modifications are present, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are detected. Regex parsing for bands, while complex, is benign. The font path is hardcoded but typical for such utilities. No external data flows or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing or visualization, with no malicious activity or security risks. The current security scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are accurate and justified.",
