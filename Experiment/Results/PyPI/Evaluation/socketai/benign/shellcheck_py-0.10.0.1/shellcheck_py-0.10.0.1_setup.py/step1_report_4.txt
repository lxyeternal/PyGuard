  "purpose": "Configure packaging for a Python project, customizing the wheel distribution behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and wheel; potential command class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; setup configuration with command classes, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Imports and exception handling define a command class, which is then passed to setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code modifies wheel distribution metadata but does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, attempts to import a wheel command class, and conditionally defines a subclass that customizes wheel build options, specifically marking the package as non-pure and changing the platform tag. It then passes this configuration to the setup function. No input/output, no data leaks, no suspicious network or system activity. The modifications are standard for customizing wheel builds and do not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script that customizes wheel distribution metadata. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
