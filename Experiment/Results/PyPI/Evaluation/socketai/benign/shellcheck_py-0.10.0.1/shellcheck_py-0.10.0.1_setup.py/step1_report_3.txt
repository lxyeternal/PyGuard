  "purpose": "Configure setup for building a Python package, specifically customizing the wheel distribution behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, optional import of bdist_wheel from wheel.bdist_wheel, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external effects; the code is used for package distribution setup.",
  "flows": "Imports → class definition → setup() call; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports and customizes the wheel build command to modify packaging metadata, indicating a standard setup customization. The try-except block handles optional import of wheel.bdist_wheel, which is common in packaging scripts. The class override sets 'root_is_pure' to False and customizes the tag to indicate non-pure Python packages, which is a typical modification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for customizing wheel packaging behavior. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
