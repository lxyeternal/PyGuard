  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a setup script that customizes wheel distribution behavior.\n- The code attempts to import `bdist_wheel` from `wheel.bdist_wheel`, defines a subclass to modify build metadata, and passes it to `setup()`.\n- No external data handling, no code injection, no network activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The modifications are standard for packaging purposes, specifically marking the package as non-pure and setting platform tags.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports conclude the code is benign, standard, and without malicious intent. The code functions as a typical packaging customization.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with proper exception handling, standard subclassing, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk)?**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, and confidence = 1. This aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The only modifications are to wheel metadata, which are benign.\n- **Therefore, malware score should be 0.**\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- The code is clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding.\n- **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- Since the code is benign, standard, and modifies only packaging metadata, the overall security risk is negligible.\n- **Risk score should be 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues with reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard setup script for customizing wheel distribution metadata. No issues, malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of all reports.",
