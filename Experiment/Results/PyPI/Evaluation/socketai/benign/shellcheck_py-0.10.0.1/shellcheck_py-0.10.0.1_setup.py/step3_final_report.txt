{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the wheel distribution process by modifying build metadata to indicate a non-pure Python package and setting platform tags.",
  "sources": "Import of 'bdist_wheel' from 'wheel.bdist_wheel', and the 'setup' function call with custom 'cmdclass'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity, data leakage, or code injection points.",
  "flows": "The import and subclass definitions flow into the 'setup' call, configuring build commands without external data flow or malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward subclassing and setup customization with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import and extend 'bdist_wheel' to modify wheel build options, marking the package as non-pure and setting platform tags. It includes exception handling for import failure. The modifications are standard for packaging and do not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The code is clear, well-structured, and intended solely for build metadata customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, reflecting its safe and routine nature.",
