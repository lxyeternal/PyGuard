  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, customizing wheel distribution options.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and wheel, use of class inheritance, setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies build metadata (root_is_pure) and get_tag output, but no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class definitions influence packaging behavior but do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious code logic. The code customizes build tags and distribution metadata in a standard way.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging libraries, attempts to override the wheel's bdist_wheel command if available, and defines a custom class that alters build metadata. It marks the package as non-pure and sets specific tags indicating no Python source or extensions. All modifications are standard for customizing wheel distribution behavior. No input from external sources is processed dynamically, and there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code's purpose is to influence package distribution metadata in a controlled and benign manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for customizing Python package wheel distribution. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply modifies build tags and distribution flags for packaging purposes.",
