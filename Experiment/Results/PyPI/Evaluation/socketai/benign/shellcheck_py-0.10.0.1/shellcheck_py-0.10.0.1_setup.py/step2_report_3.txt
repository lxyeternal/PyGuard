  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code attempts to import `bdist_wheel` from `wheel.bdist_wheel`.\n- If successful, it defines a subclass overriding `finalize_options` (sets `root_is_pure=False`) and `get_tag` (sets tags to `'py2.py3', 'none', plat`).\n- It then registers this subclass in `cmdclass` and calls `setup(cmdclass=cmdclass)`.\n- If the import fails, it proceeds with an empty `cmdclass`.\n\n**Purpose & Behavior:**\n- The modifications influence wheel distribution metadata, indicating the package is non-pure Python and setting specific platform tags.\n- These are standard customizations for package distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code functions as intended, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** No external data handling, no network activity, no secrets, or sensitive info.\n\n### Flaws or Logical Issues:\n- **No security flaws** or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code is a typical setup script for customizing wheel metadata.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Scores & Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign customization with no security implications)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed analysis, **all reports describe standard, benign packaging code**. They consistently note that the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a typical setup script used for customizing wheel distribution metadata. It does not pose any security threat, contain malware, or exhibit obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.  \n- No changes needed in scoring.  \n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nApprove the current scores as they accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.",
