  "purpose": "Configure package distribution settings using setuptools and customize wheel distribution behavior",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional import of wheel.bdist_wheel, class definition for bdist_wheel, and setup invocation",
  "sinks": "setup() function call, class methods, and return statements within get_tag()",
  "flows": "Import wheel.bdist_wheel -> Conditional import -> Class override -> setup() with cmdclass",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. The code customizes wheel distribution tags but does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing future annotations for compatibility. It imports setuptools.setup for packaging. It then attempts to import bdist_wheel from wheel.bdist_wheel, and if successful, defines a subclass to modify wheel distribution behavior. The subclass overrides finalize_options to mark the package as not pure Python and get_tag to specify the distribution tags as non-pure and platform-specific. If the import fails, cmdclass remains empty. Finally, setup() is called with the cmdclass argument. The modifications are benign, aimed at customizing wheel distribution metadata. No code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code safely customizes wheel package distribution parameters without any malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations and is aligned with standard packaging customization practices.",
