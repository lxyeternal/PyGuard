{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the behavior of the 'bdist_wheel' command for building Python wheel packages, specifically marking the package as non-pure Python and setting certain tags.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'setuptools' module and attempts to import 'bdist_wheel' from 'wheel.bdist_wheel'. It also reads the package setup configuration via 'setup()'.",
  "sinks": "The setup() call could potentially trigger package building, but no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> conditional override of 'bdist_wheel' class -> registration of custom command class -> execution of setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident. The code dynamically subclasses and modifies behavior of a packaging command, which is common for package customization.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'bdist_wheel' from the 'wheel' package. If successful, it defines a subclass that overrides 'finalize_options' and 'get_tag' methods, marking the package as non-pure and setting specific wheel tags. If the import fails, it assigns an empty command class dictionary. The setup() function is called with this command class, which affects the build process. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, code injection, or malicious behaviors. The modifications relate solely to package metadata. This pattern is common in custom package distribution scripts and does not present security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup customization for Python packaging, modifying wheel metadata to specify non-pure Python packages. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
