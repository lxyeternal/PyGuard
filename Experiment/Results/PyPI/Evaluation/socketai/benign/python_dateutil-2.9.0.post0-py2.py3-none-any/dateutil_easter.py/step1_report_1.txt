  "purpose": "Calculate Easter date using different calendar algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Reads input year and method parameter; uses standard library datetime for output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (year, method) -> internal calculations -> returns datetime.date object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The code performs straightforward date calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a function to compute Easter dates based on established astronomical algorithms, with support for different methods. It performs mathematical calculations based on input year and method, using standard Python arithmetic and control structures. It imports only the standard datetime library, and no external or network interactions are present. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or suspicious logic; all calculations appear legitimate and transparent. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Easter date calculations with no malicious intent. It uses well-known algorithms, standard libraries, and straightforward logic. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
