  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using Julian, Orthodox, or Western algorithms.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'year' and 'method'; internal calculations based on known Easter algorithms.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; purely computational with no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' and 'method' flow into calculation logic, resulting in a date object representing Easter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation of standard algorithms, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-established Easter calculation algorithms, with clear documentation and use of only standard library functions. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The calculations are transparent and based on known formulas. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely calendrical computation, and it does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent implementation of standard Easter date algorithms. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
