{
  "purpose": "Provides calculations for Easter dates using different calendar algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads input year and method parameter; uses internal calculations based on astronomical algorithms.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; outputs a datetime.date object representing Easter date.",
  "flows": "Input year and method -> calculation logic -> return Easter date.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-documented astronomical algorithms for calculating Easter dates in various calendar systems. It uses standard Python libraries and arithmetic operations without dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no data leakage observed. The calculations are based on known algorithms, and the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to calendar computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Easter date algorithms with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard date calculations and does not contain malicious or suspicious code segments.",
