{
  "purpose": "Provide a method to calculate Easter date using various calendar algorithms for different years.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'year', internal calculations based on 'year' and 'method'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external data transfer observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' flows through calculations to produce a date; no external or untrusted data used in a dangerous way.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or misleading variables present; straightforward algorithm implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements known Easter calculation algorithms with no external data fetching, no code injection points, and no use of environment variables or network operations. It primarily performs arithmetic and date calculations based on the provided year and method. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-documented calculation module, with no obfuscated patterns or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Easter date calculations with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and focused solely on its computational purpose.",
