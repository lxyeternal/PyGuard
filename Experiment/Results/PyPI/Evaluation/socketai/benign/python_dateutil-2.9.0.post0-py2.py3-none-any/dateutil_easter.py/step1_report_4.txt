{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate Easter date using different calendar algorithms for given years.",
  "sources": "Input: 'year' parameter; no external data sources; internal calculations based on input year.",
  "sinks": "Returns a datetime.date object representing Easter date; no sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input 'year' -> Calculation logic -> Return of date object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of external or network resources. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of well-known Easter calculation algorithms. It uses input year data to compute the date based on established astronomical and calendrical formulas. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are detected. The code includes detailed comments and constants for clarity, with no indication of malicious intent. The only operations are mathematical calculations and date construction, which are typical for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of Easter date calculations without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical computations and returns a date object. No suspicious or harmful code was identified.",
