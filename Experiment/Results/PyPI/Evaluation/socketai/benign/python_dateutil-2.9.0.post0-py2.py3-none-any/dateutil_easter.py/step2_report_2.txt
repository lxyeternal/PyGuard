  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of known astronomical algorithms for calculating Easter dates.\n- It uses only standard Python libraries (`datetime`) and constants.\n- No external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The calculations are transparent and based on well-documented formulas.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate description; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1; confirms standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; detailed, consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Observation:** The securityRisk score is set to 0.1, which is very low, indicating minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is purely computational and no external or malicious activity is detected, a score of 0.1 seems reasonable, perhaps reflecting a generic low risk for computational modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurate; no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; well-documented, standard algorithms.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Similar to Report 3, the low security risk score is justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign, mathematical nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly identifying no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified because the code performs simple calculations without external dependencies or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, as it's a simple, well-understood calculation module.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, transparent, and performs a legitimate function without security concerns.",
