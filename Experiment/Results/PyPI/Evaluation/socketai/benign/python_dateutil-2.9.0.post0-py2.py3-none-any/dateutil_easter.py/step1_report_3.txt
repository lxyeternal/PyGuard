{
  "purpose": "Calculate the date of Easter for a given year using different algorithms (Julian, Orthodox, Western).",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'year' parameter and uses constants for method selection.",
  "sinks": "Uses datetime.date to generate a date object; no untrusted data or external output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'year' is processed internally; no external data flows to external sinks or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; algorithms are standard astronomical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known algorithms for calculating Easter date based on specified methods. It performs calculations involving modular arithmetic and date conversions, but only uses internal constants and parameters. No external or untrusted data sources, no network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. The code appears transparent, and the calculations follow documented formulas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Easter date calculation algorithms with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs mathematical computations based on input year and method without any suspicious side effects or malicious behaviors.",
