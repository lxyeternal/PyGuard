  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of known algorithms for calculating Easter dates, with support for Julian, Orthodox, and Western methods.\n- It uses only standard Python libraries (`datetime`) and simple arithmetic.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears transparent, well-documented, and aligned with standard algorithms.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, straightforward logic, standard algorithms.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, consistent, standard implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard algorithms, no external dependencies, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — matches the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — this is a very low score; given the code's benign nature, perhaps too high.\n  \n**Justification for risk score:** Since the code is purely computational and has no side effects, a risk score of 0.1 overstates the actual risk. It should be closer to 0.\n\n**Malware score justification:** Correct at 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score should be lowered to 0 for better consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, straightforward, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — again, likely overstated.\n  \n**Justification:** The code is benign; the risk score should be 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Adjust risk score to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as previous; standard implementation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — again, possibly overstated.\n\n**Justification:** The code is transparent and safe. The risk score should be 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Adjust risk score to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | **0** (was 0.1) |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | **0** (was 0.1) |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | **0** (was 0.1) |\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as the code is purely computational and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, transparent implementation of well-known algorithms for calculating Easter dates. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor security risk scores of 0.1 seem unjustified and should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual behavior and the detailed analysis.",
