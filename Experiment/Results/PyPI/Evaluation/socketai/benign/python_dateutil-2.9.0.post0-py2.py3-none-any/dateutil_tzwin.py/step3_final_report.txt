  "flows": "Import from internal module to namespace, no external flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can cause namespace pollution but is common in internal package re-exports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import from an internal module, with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. The wildcard import is a style concern but does not introduce security risks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external communication are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The only concern is the use of a wildcard import, which is a style issue rather than a security threat. The assigned scores are consistent with this assessment.",
