  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as implementing lazy importing of submodules via __getattr__, with controlled access via __all__.\n- No report indicates the presence of malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.\n- The code's behavior aligns with standard Python lazy-loading patterns, with safeguards preventing arbitrary imports.\n- The version handling with a try-except block is typical and does not introduce security concerns.\n- The potential risk of exploitation through manipulation of __all__ is minimal, given its static definition.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n- Most reports assign a very low or zero security risk score (0 or 0.1). Given the controlled import mechanism and lack of external input handling, this seems appropriate.\n- The second report assigns a risk of 0.1, citing a theoretical potential if attribute access is manipulated, but this is a minimal concern given the static __all__.\n\n**Analysis of the reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard lazy-loading pattern with no malicious intent.\n- They appropriately note that dynamic import via __getattr__ is safe here because of the strict check against __all__.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard cautious notes, which are reasonable.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions.\n- The dynamic import mechanism is controlled and typical.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The risk scores are reasonable; no higher scores are justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a safe, standard implementation of lazy module importing with appropriate safeguards. The reports are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.",
