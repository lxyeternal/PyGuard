  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of lazy module importing with appropriate safeguards. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the controlled use of dynamic import. Overall, the code is secure and well-structured."
