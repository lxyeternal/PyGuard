{
  "purpose": "This code provides a module that performs lazy importing of submodules when attributes are accessed, facilitating on-demand loading of specific components.",
  "sources": "The code reads the attribute name in __getattr__, imports modules dynamically using importlib.import_module.",
  "sinks": "Potential risk if __getattr__ is exploited to import malicious modules; however, in this context, the import is restricted to predefined module names in __all__.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__, which imports modules listed in __all__, ensuring controlled dynamic import without user input.",
  "anomalies": "The __dir__ function uses globals() and sys.modules to list available attributes, which is typical for lazy loading modules. No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up lazy loading for specified submodules, importing only when needed. It uses a controlled list (__all__) to prevent arbitrary imports, reducing risk. The exception handling for _version import is standard. The dynamic import via __getattr__ is safe here because it restricts imports to known modules. The __dir__ method aims to include all importable modules for introspection, which is common for lazy modules. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module employs standard lazy import techniques with appropriate safeguards. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and safe for use.",
