{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports specific submodules when accessed as attributes of the module, enabling lazy loading of modules for efficiency.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's attribute names via __getattr__ and the __all__ list, and imports submodules using importlib.import_module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that process untrusted input or data that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__, which then imports the corresponding submodule, but no untrusted data flows into these imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of dynamic import via importlib is standard for lazy loading, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a list of submodules and provides a mechanism (__getattr__) to import them on demand. It handles ImportError for missing version info gracefully. The __dir__ function enhances introspection. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risks. The code's behavior appears benign and standard for modular packages employing lazy import techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical implementation of lazy module loading with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe and intentionally designed for efficiency.",
