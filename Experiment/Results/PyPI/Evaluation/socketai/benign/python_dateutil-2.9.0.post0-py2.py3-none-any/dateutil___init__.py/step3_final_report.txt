{
  "purpose": "Implement lazy loading of submodules via __getattr__, allowing modules to be imported only when accessed, to optimize load times and resource usage.",
  "sources": "Access to module attributes listed in __all__, triggering importlib.import_module for corresponding submodules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; controlled dynamic import limited to predefined module names.",
  "flows": "Attribute access on the module triggers __getattr__, which imports the module if in __all__, otherwise raises AttributeError.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks; standard pattern with no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list __all__ for allowed submodules, uses __getattr__ to perform controlled dynamic imports, and __dir__ to enhance introspection. Version info is handled gracefully with a try-except block. The import mechanism is tightly controlled, preventing arbitrary code execution. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The implementation aligns with best practices for lazy module loading in Python packages, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of lazy module importing with appropriate safeguards. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the controlled use of dynamic import. Overall, the code is secure and well-structured.",
