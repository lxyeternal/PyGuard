  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling datetime objects, including obtaining current date, setting timezone info, and comparing datetimes within a delta.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (tzinfo, dt, dt1, dt2, delta), and system time via datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; functions return new datetime objects or boolean values based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input tzinfo and datetime objects flow through functions; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No use of dynamic code execution or external network access.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for datetime operations: 'today' computes current date with optional timezone, 'default_tzinfo' assigns timezone info if naive, 'within_delta' compares two datetimes within a delta. All functions perform standard datetime operations without any data leaks, external communications, or malicious behavior. The code structure and comments are consistent with standard utility implementations. No anomalies or suspicious code features identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard, well-structured datetime utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
