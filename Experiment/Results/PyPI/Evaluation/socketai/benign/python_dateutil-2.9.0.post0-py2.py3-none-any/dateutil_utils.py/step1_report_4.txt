  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling Python datetime objects, including obtaining the current date, assigning timezone info, and comparing datetimes within a delta.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: tzinfo, dt, dt1, dt2, delta.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data is being output or executed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (tzinfo, dt, dt1, dt2, delta) flow through functions, affecting datetime computations; no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code uses standard datetime operations with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three utility functions: 'today' generates current date at midnight with optional timezone; 'default_tzinfo' assigns timezone info to naive datetimes; 'within_delta' compares two datetimes within a specified delta. All functions use straightforward, standard library datetime operations. No user input or external data is involved that could lead to malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or harmful operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for datetime handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, and does not interact with external systems. It is safe and aligned with standard practices.",
