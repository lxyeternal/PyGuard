  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling and manipulating datetime objects, including getting the current day, setting timezone info, and comparing datetimes within a delta.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via datetime.now() and datetime.combine() functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is sent externally or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input from system time and datetime objects flows through functions for processing, with no external output or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions for datetime handling with appropriate use of timezone info. Functions are straightforward and do not perform any external communication, file access, or insecure operations. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The code appears to be utility functions intended for datetime operations, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of benign utility functions for datetime manipulation, with no malicious activity or security risks identified. It is safe and does not pose any supply chain security threats.",
