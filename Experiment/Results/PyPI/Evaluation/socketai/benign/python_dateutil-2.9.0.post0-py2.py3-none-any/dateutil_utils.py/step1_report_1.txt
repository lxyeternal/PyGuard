{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling datetime objects, including getting the current day at midnight, setting timezone info on naive datetimes, and comparing datetimes within a delta.",
  "sources": "Reads system time with datetime.now(), accesses dt.tzinfo, and datetime objects provided as arguments.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to external systems, files, or network; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The functions process input datetime objects and optional timezone info, performing transformations or comparisons without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. The code performs standard datetime operations.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard utility functions for datetime handling: 'today' computes the current date at midnight with optional timezone, 'default_tzinfo' assigns timezone info to naive datetimes, and 'within_delta' compares two datetimes for approximate equality. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. All operations are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard datetime utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is typical and safe.",
