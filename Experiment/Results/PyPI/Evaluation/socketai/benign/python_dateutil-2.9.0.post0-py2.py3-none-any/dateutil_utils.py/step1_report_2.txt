{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling datetime objects, such as obtaining the current date, assigning timezone info, and comparing datetime differences.",
  "sources": "Imports from datetime module, input parameters to functions (tzinfo, dt, delta, dt1, dt2).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions operate on passed-in datetime objects and do not perform any network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The functions process datetime objects to produce modified or compared datetime instances, with no external data or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard library functions as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for datetime manipulation. It imports standard modules, defines functions with clear docstrings, and performs simple operations like getting current datetime, setting timezone info, and comparing two datetimes with a delta. No external inputs are taken from untrusted sources, nor are there outputs to network or files. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for datetime operations with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and typical of a standard Python helper module.",
