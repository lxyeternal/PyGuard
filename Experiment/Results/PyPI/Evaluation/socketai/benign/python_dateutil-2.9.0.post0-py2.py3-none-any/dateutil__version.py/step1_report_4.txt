  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No data flows; static variable assignments only",
  "anomalies": "Comments indicate auto-generation and no manual edits; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns version strings and tuples to module variables, with comments indicating it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm. No external input, data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs. The structure is straightforward and typical for version metadata files. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated version information file with no malicious intent or security issues.",
