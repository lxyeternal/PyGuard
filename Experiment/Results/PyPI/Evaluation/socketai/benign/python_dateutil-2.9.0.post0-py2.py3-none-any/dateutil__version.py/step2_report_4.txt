  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it to the original code.\n\n**Original Code Summary:**\n- Static assignment of version info (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`)\n- Generated by setuptools_scm\n- No input/output, data flow, or dynamic behavior\n- Comments indicate auto-generation\n- No malicious or suspicious elements\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define version info, generated by setuptools_scm\n- Sources: Inline static assignment\n- Sinks/Flows: None\n- Anomalies: None\n- Analysis: No malicious code, just static assignment\n- Conclusion: Benign, auto-generated, no security risk\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define version info, generated automatically\n- Sources: Hardcoded version string\n- Sinks/Flows: None\n- Anomalies: Comments about auto-generation\n- Analysis: Static assignment, no external input or suspicious behavior\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Version info, generated by setuptools_scm\n- Sources: Version strings and tuples\n- Sinks/Flows: None\n- Anomalies: Comments about auto-generation\n- Analysis: Static assignment, no external data or malicious activity\n- Conclusion: Benign\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Version info, generated by setuptools_scm\n- Sources: Static assignment\n- Sinks/Flows: None\n- Anomalies: Comments indicating auto-generation\n- Analysis: Straightforward static assignment, no malicious behavior\n- Conclusion: Benign\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Version info, generated by setuptools_scm\n- Sources: Version variables from setuptools_scm\n- Sinks/Flows: None\n- Anomalies: None\n- Analysis: Static assignment, no suspicious activity\n- Conclusion: Benign\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata file.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- All scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are set to 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational and does not pose any security threat.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration with no security concerns.",
