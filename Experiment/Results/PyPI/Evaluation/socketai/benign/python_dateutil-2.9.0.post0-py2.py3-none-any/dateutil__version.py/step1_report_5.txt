  "flows": "N/A - simple variable assignments with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static version information assigned from setuptools_scm's generated data. It explicitly states it was generated by setuptools_scm and includes version variables. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as version metadata. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
