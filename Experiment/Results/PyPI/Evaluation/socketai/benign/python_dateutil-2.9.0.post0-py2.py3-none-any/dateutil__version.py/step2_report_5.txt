  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns static version information to variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`).\n   - There are no external data sources, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no data flows from untrusted sources.\n   - The code is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, as indicated by comments, which is standard practice for version management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - The confidence levels are all high (1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, there is no reason to assign any risk scores above 0.5.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, so risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - Both are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - The code is not obfuscated, nor does it exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is auto-generated and benign, which is consistent with the content.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the static assignment, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Overall Consistency and Personal Estimate:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - Given the code, I agree with the assigned scores.\n   - My own assessment aligns with the reports: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration with no security concerns.\n- All scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is benign with no security risks.",
