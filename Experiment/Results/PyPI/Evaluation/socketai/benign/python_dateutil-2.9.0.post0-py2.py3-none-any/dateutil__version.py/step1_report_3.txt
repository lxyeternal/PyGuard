  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, likely from an external versioning tool.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flow to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comment indicating auto-generation; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns version-related variables, indicating it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm. It explicitly states not to change or track in version control. There are no input reads, no untrusted data sources, and no data flows or sinks. The code is minimal, static, and straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious behavior. The comments clarify its purpose as a generated file, which is common in Python projects for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version information file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
