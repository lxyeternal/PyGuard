{
  "purpose": "Provides access to timezone information from a packaged zoneinfo tarball, including functions to retrieve timezone objects and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a tar.gz file embedded in the package via get_data, extracts files and metadata from the tarball, and reads environment data when fetching time zones.",
  "sinks": "Uses get_data to load the zoneinfo tarball, and reads files within it; no network connections or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "getzoneinfofile_stream() retrieves embedded data; ZoneInfoFile reads and parses tarball data; gettz and get_zonefile_instance provide timezone objects from cached or new instances.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_data from pkgutil to load embedded data is normal; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected. Warnings issued for deprecated functions; no suspicious code execution or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads timezone data from an embedded tarball using standard library functions, constructs timezone objects, caches instances, and issues deprecation warnings for outdated API functions. No network activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The flow is straightforward: read embedded data, parse files, cache instances, and provide accessors. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No anomalous or malicious patterns are evident beyond deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for timezone data access from embedded resources. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signs are present. The security risk score is very low. The code is well-structured and transparent, with only deprecation warnings indicating evolution rather than malicious intent.",
