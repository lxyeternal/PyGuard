      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, RFC 5545-compliant recurrence rule implementation with no malicious activity or sabotage. It relies on well-known libraries and standard practices. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to input validation, which is typical for such parsing libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting low inherent risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent implementation of standard Easter date algorithms. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, the obfuscated score should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of lazy module importing with appropriate safeguards. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the controlled use of dynamic import. Overall, the code is secure and well-structured."

      "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard date manipulation utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The high confidence in benignity is supported by the absence of suspicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and should remain as such."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for datetime handling with a minor implementation bug in the 'today()' function. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The existing security scores are correct; the main issue is correcting the 'time()' call in 'today()' for proper functionality."
