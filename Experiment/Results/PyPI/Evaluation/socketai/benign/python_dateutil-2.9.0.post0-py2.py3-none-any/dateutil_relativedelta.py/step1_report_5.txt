{
  "purpose": "Provides a relativedelta class for manipulating and calculating date and time differences, including relative and absolute date adjustments.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (datetime, calendar, operator, math, six, warnings) and a local module ._common for weekday calculations.",
  "sinks": "Uses date arithmetic operations, but no untrusted data input, network operations, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; code primarily performs date calculations and object manipulations without external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Code appears to be a standard implementation of date manipulation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'relativedelta' class for date arithmetic, handling both relative and absolute date differences, with various methods for addition, subtraction, normalization, and comparison. No network operations, data leaks, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of standard library modules and straightforward arithmetic indicates typical date handling functionality. The class methods perform logical operations consistent with date/time calculations without any indication of malicious intent or covert behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate date/time utility class with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It does not include network operations, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Its structure and functionality align with typical date manipulation libraries.",
