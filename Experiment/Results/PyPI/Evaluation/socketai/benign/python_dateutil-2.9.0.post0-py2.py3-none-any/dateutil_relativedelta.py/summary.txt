  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, standard date manipulation utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The high confidence in benignity is supported by the absence of suspicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and should remain as such."
