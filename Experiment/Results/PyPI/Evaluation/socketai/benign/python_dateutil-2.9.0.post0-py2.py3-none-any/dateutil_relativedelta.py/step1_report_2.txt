{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'relativedelta' for manipulating date and time differences, including relative and absolute date calculations, for use with datetime objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters during initialization, including date/datetime objects, numerical values, and optional weekday specifications.",
  "sinks": "The code performs date arithmetic, creating new datetime objects, and adjusts date components based on input; no direct data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed during object construction; date arithmetic methods like __add__ and __radd__ manipulate datetime objects; no untrusted data flows into external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code implements standard date calculations and operator overloads without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a 'relativedelta' class for complex date manipulations, with detailed handling of relative and absolute date components, and supports addition/subtraction with date objects and timedeltas. It uses standard Python modules and practices, with no signs of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical date utility class, with comprehensive methods for date arithmetic, including normalization and property calculations. The only minor concern is a deprecation warning for non-integer absolute values, which is a benign warning mechanism. No external or hidden system calls, network operations, or suspicious logic were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard date manipulation utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for date calculations and does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors.",
