{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, serving as a simple version declaration in the codebase.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line assigning a string to a variable named VERSION. It contains no functions, input/output, external connections, or dynamic code execution. The code is typical for version declaration and does not perform any malicious or suspicious actions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and high confidence. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
