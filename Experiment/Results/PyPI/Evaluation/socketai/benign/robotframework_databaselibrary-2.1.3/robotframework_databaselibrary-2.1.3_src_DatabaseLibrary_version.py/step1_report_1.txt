  "purpose": "Define the version of a software component or package",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows since the code only assigns a constant string to a variable",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observable",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single variable assignment setting VERSION to '2.1.3'. There are no functions, data input, external connections, or other operations. It appears to be a simple version declaration, a common pattern in software projects. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues are detectable based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward assignment of a version string with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
