  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core functionality: a decorator that warns about deprecated argument names and remaps them.\n- They consistently identify the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The code uses standard Python practices, with no external data sources, network activity, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only logs warnings via `logger.warn` and `logger.info`, which are typical for deprecation notices.\n- The remapping of argument names is straightforward and does not involve any complex or malicious logic.\n- The use of `robot.api.logger` suggests integration with Robot Framework, which is a common testing framework, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0. Given the benign nature, this is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or overestimations:**\n- No issues are detected in the code logic or behavior.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard utility for handling deprecated arguments with warnings.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a deprecation warning decorator, with no malicious or security concerns. The reported scores are accurate and justified.",
