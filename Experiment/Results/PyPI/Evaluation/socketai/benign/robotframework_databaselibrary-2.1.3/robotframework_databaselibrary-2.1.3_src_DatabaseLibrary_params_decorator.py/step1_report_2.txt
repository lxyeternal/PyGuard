  "purpose": "Decorator to warn about and remap deprecated argument names in functions.",
  "sources": "Input: kwargs (keyword arguments) in wrapper function.",
  "sinks": "logger.warn and logger.info calls, which output warnings and info messages.",
  "flows": "kwargs with old argument names are detected, a warning is logged, and the argument is renamed before calling the original function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of logging for warnings, which is standard. No obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'renamed_args' that remaps old argument names to new ones in decorated functions, issuing warnings through the 'robot.api.logger'. It modifies keyword arguments before invoking the wrapped function. No external data sources or sinks beyond logging are present. The code performs straightforward argument handling with standard Python features. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard decorator for deprecating argument names with logging warnings. It does not contain malware or security risks, and no malicious intent is detected.",
