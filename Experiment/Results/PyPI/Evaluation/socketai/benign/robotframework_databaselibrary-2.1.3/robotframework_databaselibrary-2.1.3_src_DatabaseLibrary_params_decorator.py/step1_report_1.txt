{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to warn about deprecated argument names and automatically remap them to new argument names in function calls.",
  "sources": "Reads argument names from kwargs when functions are called, and uses the 'logger' to issue warnings and info messages.",
  "sinks": "Potentially logs messages via 'logger.warn' and 'logger.info'; no data output or external network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Old argument names in kwargs are detected and replaced with new names, with logs issued as side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code uses standard decorators and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'renamed_args' that checks for deprecated argument names in function calls. It logs warnings when such arguments are used and remaps them to current names, then calls the original function. The code relies on 'robot.api.logger' for messaging, which is a standard logging utility. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The implementation is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling deprecated function arguments with appropriate warnings. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
