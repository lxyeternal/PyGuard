  "purpose": "Decorator to handle deprecated argument names by renaming and issuing warnings",
  "sources": "Input arguments via kwargs, function decorators, logger warnings and info calls",
  "sinks": "Potential modification of kwargs, logging outputs",
  "flows": "kwargs with old argument names are renamed and logged before calling the original function",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed; standard use of decorators and logging",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'renamed_args' that maps deprecated argument names to new ones, issuing warnings and renaming arguments in kwargs before calling the wrapped function. Uses 'logger.warn' and 'logger.info' for warnings, which are standard logging methods. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious logic present. The code appears solely for deprecation warnings, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation decorator with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply manages argument renaming and warnings, aligning with typical software maintenance practices.",
