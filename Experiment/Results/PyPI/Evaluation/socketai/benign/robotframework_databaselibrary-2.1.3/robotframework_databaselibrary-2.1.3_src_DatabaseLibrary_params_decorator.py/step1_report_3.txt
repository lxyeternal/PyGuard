{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to warn users about deprecated argument names and automatically remap them to new argument names for functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the function call arguments via *args and **kwargs, and from the 'mapping' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code writes warnings and info logs using 'logger.warn' and 'logger.info'.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (kwargs) are checked for deprecated names, then possibly remapped; logs are generated; finally, the decorated function is called with updated arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Usage of logging for warnings and info is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard decorator pattern for argument remapping and warning. It uses 'logger' for warnings, which is typical for deprecation notices. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code's purpose appears benign and aligned with common deprecation handling. It reads input arguments and logs messages, both of which are typical behaviors. No external data fetching, code injection, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a deprecation warning decorator for function arguments. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use and appears to serve a maintenance purpose in code evolution.",
