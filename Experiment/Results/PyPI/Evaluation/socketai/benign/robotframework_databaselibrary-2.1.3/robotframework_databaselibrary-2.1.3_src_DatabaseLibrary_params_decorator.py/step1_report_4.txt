  "purpose": "Decorator to warn users about deprecated argument names and remap them to new names.",
  "sources": "Function input parameters (kwargs) for old argument names.",
  "sinks": "Logger warnings and info messages; remapped arguments passed to the wrapped function.",
  "flows": "Old argument names in kwargs trigger warnings and are replaced; then the function is called with updated arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard use of decorators and logging. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that remaps deprecated argument names to new ones and logs warnings when such arguments are used. It uses standard Python practices with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The logger outputs are benign and serve only informational purposes. No data leakage, malicious actions, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for argument deprecation management. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and is safe for use. No security threats or malware signals are present.",
