  "purpose": "Decorator to warn about deprecated argument names and remap them to new names.",
  "sources": "kwargs in the wrapper function where old argument names are checked and replaced.",
  "sinks": "logger.warn and logger.info calls that output warnings and info messages.",
  "flows": "kwargs containing old argument names -> logger warnings/infos -> kwargs updated -> original function called with remapped kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward argument remapping and logging; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'renamed_args' that checks for deprecated argument names in kwargs, logs warnings, remaps them to new names, and calls the wrapped function with updated kwargs. It uses standard Python features and the robot.api.logger for logging. No external data access, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is simple, clear, and serves a common deprecation purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and the logging is appropriate for deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for handling deprecated function arguments with appropriate warnings. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
