  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code implements a database query utility for Robot Framework, reading SQL commands, scripts, and procedure parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes SQL commands via cursor, with data flowing from input parameters to database execution.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious code. Uses regex for script parsing—standard practice.\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. Risks are typical for executing external SQL, which depends on caller sanitization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with emphasis on executing SQL and stored procedures, reading from parameters and files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into database driver calls; no explicit sanitization, but standard for such libraries.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No backdoors or suspicious patterns. Regex for script parsing is standard.\n- **Security & Malware:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, with detailed handling of scripts, procedures, and multiple DB backends.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes SQL commands and procedures; data flow is typical.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard regex parsing.\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:** Empty, no analysis.\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with emphasis on logging and connection management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes SQL, logs results—potential for sensitive data exposure if logs are not secured.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** Extensive logging could expose secrets but is not malicious.\n- **Security & Malware:** No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs of code obfuscation or hidden malicious patterns.\n- **Security Risks:** The main concern is external SQL input and script files, which is typical for database libraries; proper sanitization should be enforced externally.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — no obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk:** Given the potential for SQL injection if inputs are not sanitized externally, a risk score of around **0.2** remains appropriate. The code itself is not malicious but relies on external input safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n**The code is a standard, well-structured database utility library for Robot Framework. It performs typical SQL execution, script parsing, and stored procedure handling. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The primary security concern is external input sanitization, which is outside the scope of this code.**\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**These scores reflect a safe, legitimate utility with typical security considerations.**",
