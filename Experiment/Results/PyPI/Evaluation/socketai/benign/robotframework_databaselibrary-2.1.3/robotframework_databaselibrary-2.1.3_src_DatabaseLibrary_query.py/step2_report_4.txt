  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and the overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a database utility for Robot Framework, executing SQL, scripts, and stored procedures. It manages connections, transactions, and logs results. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, due to external input reliance, but standard for such utilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no malware. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the execution of SQL, scripts, and stored procedures across multiple databases. No signs of malicious activity. The analysis notes potential injection risk due to raw SQL execution but clarifies this is a common concern, not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — aligns with typical database utility risks.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard database utility functions with careful transaction management and logging. No malicious or obfuscated code observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe utility.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and thorough. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** \"Empty response\" — no analysis provided.\n- **Assessment:** Cannot evaluate; no information.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a database utility with extensive logging, script parsing, and multi-database support. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. Potential security concern about logging sensitive data, but this is a common issue, not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable for such a utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, indicating no malicious code detected. Given the code's nature, this is correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, and the code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The common low value of 0.2 is appropriate, considering external input handling and standard SQL execution practices.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n**The code is a standard, well-structured database utility library for Robot Framework, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects typical concerns about SQL injection from external inputs, which is expected for such a utility.**\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the detailed code review.",
