{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of methods for database assertions and query checks, primarily used within a testing or validation framework to verify database state and contents.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters such as SQL select statements, table names, assertion operators, expected values, and connection aliases.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL queries constructed with string interpolation, potentially leading to SQL injection if untrusted input is used directly in the query strings.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (e.g., select statements, table names, parameters) flows into SQL query construction, which then flows into database query execution methods.",
  "anomalies": "Potential for SQL injection exists due to direct string formatting of SQL queries with input parameters without sanitization. There are no explicit safeguards like parameterized queries or input sanitization. No code indicates malicious behavior or backdoors, but the pattern of directly embedding user-controlled data into SQL statements is a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code's core functions perform database assertions by executing SQL queries constructed via string formatting. This approach can be exploited if any of the input parameters (such as 'select_statement', 'table_name', or 'query') are derived from untrusted sources. The code does not use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or sanitization functions, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system commands. The code's main concern is the insecure SQL construction pattern, which could be exploited for SQL injection if used improperly in a larger, untrusted context.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious intent by itself, but it demonstrates insecure SQL query construction patterns that can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if untrusted input is used. There is no evidence of hidden backdoors, malware, or malicious data exfiltration. The primary security risk is the unsafe handling of input data in SQL queries, which should be addressed with parameterized queries or proper sanitization.",
