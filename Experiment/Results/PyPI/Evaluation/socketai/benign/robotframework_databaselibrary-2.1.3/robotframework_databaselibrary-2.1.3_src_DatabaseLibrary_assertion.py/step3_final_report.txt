{
  "purpose": "The code provides database assertion functions for testing, executing SQL queries to verify database state, such as existence of tables, row counts, and query results.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as select_statement, table_name, selectStatement, alias, parameters, and other user-provided strings that are embedded into SQL queries.",
  "sinks": "SQL query execution points where constructed queries are sent to the database engine, potentially executing untrusted input if not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SQL query strings via string formatting or concatenation, which are then executed by the database driver.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs SQL queries using string interpolation without parameterization or sanitization, leading to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions dynamically build SQL queries by embedding user-controlled or variable input directly into the query strings, which can be exploited if inputs are untrusted. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The primary security concern is the potential for SQL injection due to unsafe query construction. The code is intended for testing and validation purposes, which often involves such patterns, but in production or security-sensitive environments, this pattern is unsafe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk around 0.2-0.6) are appropriate given the context. Confidence in this analysis is high (around 0.8), as the pattern is clear and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but demonstrates insecure SQL query construction via string interpolation, which poses a risk of SQL injection if used with untrusted input. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and moderate security risk scores reflecting the injection vulnerability. For improved security, refactoring to use parameterized queries is recommended, but the current assessment of malicious intent is accurate.",
