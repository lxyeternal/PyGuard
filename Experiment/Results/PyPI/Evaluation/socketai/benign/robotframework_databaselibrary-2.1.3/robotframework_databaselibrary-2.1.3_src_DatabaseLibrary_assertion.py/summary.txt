  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but demonstrates insecure SQL query construction via string interpolation, which poses a risk of SQL injection if used with untrusted input. There is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and moderate security risk scores reflecting the injection vulnerability. For improved security, refactoring to use parameterized queries is recommended, but the current assessment of malicious intent is accurate."
