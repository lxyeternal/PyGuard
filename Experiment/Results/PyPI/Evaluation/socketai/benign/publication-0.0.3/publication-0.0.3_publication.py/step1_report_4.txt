{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility to control module interface exposure by reassigning module attributes, primarily for encapsulation and API management.",
  "sources": "Reads the calling module's __name__, __all__, and local variables via sys._getframe(1).f_locals.",
  "sinks": "Sets attributes on a new module object and on the existing module in sys.modules; creates a private module reference and attaches it under a modified name.",
  "flows": "Uses sys._getframe to access caller's local variables, then copies specified attributes from the original module to a new module object, and stores the private reference.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. The code dynamically manipulates modules and sys.modules, which could be used maliciously if misused, but in this context appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically redefines the module's interface by creating a new module object and selectively copying attributes from the original module based on __all__. It then attaches the original module as a private namespace under a specific name. The use of sys._getframe to access caller's locals is standard for such metaprogramming. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The approach could be misused for stealthy manipulations but appears intended for controlled API hiding.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a module API encapsulation utility with no evident malicious behavior. It manipulates the module system for interface control, which is a legitimate pattern. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
