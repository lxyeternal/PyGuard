{
  "purpose": "This code provides a mechanism for modules to control their public API by hiding internal details and exposing only specified parts.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes (__all__, __name__, sys._getframe) and the module's local variables.",
  "sinks": "The code sets attributes on new modules and manipulates sys.modules entries, which could potentially influence module import behavior.",
  "flows": "The publish() function retrieves the caller's module info, creates a new module, copies specified attributes, and replaces the original module in sys.modules, also storing a private reference.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Uses sys._getframe, which can be sensitive, but is standard for introspection. No external network activity or file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'publish' function that re-exports selected public API elements of a module, moving unlisted internals to a '_private' namespace. It manipulates sys.modules entries to control what gets exposed upon import. The code relies on introspection of the caller's frame to determine the module context. It uses standard modules and attributes without any suspicious or malicious code. No external communication, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for controlling module interface exposure, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manipulates module attributes and the sys.modules registry for API management, which is a legitimate pattern. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
