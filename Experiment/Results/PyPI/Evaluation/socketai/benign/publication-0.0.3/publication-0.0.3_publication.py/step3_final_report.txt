  "purpose": "Control module API exposure by re-exporting selected attributes and hiding internals under '_private'.",
  "sources": "Accesses caller module's local variables (__name__, __all__) via sys._getframe().",
  "sinks": "Manipulates sys.modules to replace the module with a new one; stores original module under a '_private' namespace.",
  "flows": "Reads __name__ and __all__ from caller's locals, creates new ModuleType, copies attributes, replaces sys.modules entry, and sets a private reference.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys._getframe() for introspection; advanced module manipulation but no suspicious secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard techniques for API encapsulation, including dynamic module creation and namespace management. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of sys._getframe() and sys.modules manipulation is advanced but legitimate for controlling API exposure. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The manipulation could be misused in malicious contexts, but in this code, it serves a legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for API encapsulation with no signs of malicious activity or security flaws. While techniques used are advanced, they are standard for such purposes. The risk of misuse exists but is not demonstrated here. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
