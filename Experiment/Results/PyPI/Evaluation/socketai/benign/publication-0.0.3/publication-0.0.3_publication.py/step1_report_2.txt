{
  "purpose": "The code implements a module to control and restrict access to certain module attributes, exposing only a public API and hiding internal details under a '_private' namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes (__name__, __all__, and other built-in module attributes) and retrieves the calling module's local variables via sys._getframe(1).f_locals.",
  "sinks": "The code sets new module objects in sys.modules, overwriting the original module, and creates a '_private' module in sys.modules, potentially affecting module import behavior.",
  "flows": "From sys._getframe(1).f_locals, extracting module name and __all__, then creating a new module object and copying specified attributes, while storing the original module in sys.modules under a new name.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors; the dynamic creation and replacement of modules could be misused in specific malicious contexts but is consistent with the module's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically manipulates the module's namespace by creating a new module object and exposing only the specified '__all__' attributes, hiding others in a '_private' namespace. It relies on sys._getframe() to access caller's local variables and alters sys.modules to replace the original module. This approach is designed for controlling API exposure. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or network activity. The code performs a specific, legitimate function related to module API management, with no evidence of sabotage or malware. The use of sys._getframe() is typical for such meta-programming techniques and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended to enforce a clean public API by hiding internal implementation details. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a controlled, purposeful transformation of the module's interface, consistent with its documented goal. Therefore, it poses low security risk and no malware threat.",
