  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution of the 'publication' module.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call, such as name, version, description, author, email, url, and py_modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; static configuration does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.core.setup to define package metadata. All data are hardcoded strings with no dynamic input or evaluation. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present. The comments indicate this is a generated setup script, likely standard boilerplate. No suspicious patterns, external data handling, or executable code beyond the setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration script for packaging. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
