  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-designed checkpoint management system with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The existing malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified. The potential for misuse via user-defined functions is a known and accepted risk in configurable systems, not indicative of malicious behavior."
