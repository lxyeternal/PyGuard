  "purpose": "To export and provide access to various checkpointer classes from the orbax.checkpoint._src.checkpointers package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from orbax.checkpoint._src.checkpointers submodules",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only imports classes without processing untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines public symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard import statements with no unusual patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from internal modules of the orbax.checkpoint package to expose them as public symbols. The license header indicates proper licensing, and the imports are straightforward without any dynamic execution or handling of external input. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward module initializer for public access to checkpoint-related classes. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and it appears to be a benign part of a larger package. No security risks or malware detected.",
