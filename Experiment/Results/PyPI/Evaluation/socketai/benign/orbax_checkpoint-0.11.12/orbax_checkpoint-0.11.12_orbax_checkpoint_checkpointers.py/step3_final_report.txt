  "purpose": "This code defines and exports public symbols for the 'checkpointers' module by importing internal classes and exposing them as public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading internal classes from various internal modules within 'orbax.checkpoint._src.checkpointers'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as source points; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements exposing internal classes as public symbols. There is no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or suspicious behavior. The license header is standard. All signals indicate benign, standard API exposure code. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module for exporting internal classes as public API symbols. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
