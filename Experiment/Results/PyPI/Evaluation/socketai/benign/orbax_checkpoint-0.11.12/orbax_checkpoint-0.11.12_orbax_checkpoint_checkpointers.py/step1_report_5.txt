  "purpose": "This code defines public symbols for the checkpointers module by importing specific classes from internal modules, likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules within the 'orbax.checkpoint._src.checkpointers' package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward and do not process untrusted input; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes and exposes them as public symbols. It does not execute any logic, handle inputs, or perform network or file operations. The license header is standard. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module interface file, exposing internal classes for external use. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe.",
