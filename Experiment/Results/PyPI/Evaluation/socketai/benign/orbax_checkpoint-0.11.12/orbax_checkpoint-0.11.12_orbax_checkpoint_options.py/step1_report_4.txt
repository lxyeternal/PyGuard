  "purpose": "Define configuration data classes for checkpoint management APIs, including async, multiprocessing, and file options.",
  "sources": "No user input, network data, or environment variables are read. The code imports modules and defines data classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as file writing, network communication, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal class attribute assignments without external influence or untrusted data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All code is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python data class definitions for configuration purposes. No input sources, external data, or untrusted sinks are present. The imported modules are standard or from the same package, with no dynamic execution or code injection. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The code adheres to common practices for defining configuration options without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup for checkpoint management and contains no malicious or security-threatening components. It poses no risk and appears to be safe.",
