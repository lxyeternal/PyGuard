{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration options for checkpoint management, async behavior, multiprocessing, and file permissions in distributed systems.",
  "sources": "Static data class attributes; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no output operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard use of dataclasses and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python dataclass definitions used for configuration purposes. It imports 'multihost' only for type annotations and does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle sensitive data. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for distributed or ML system configuration modules, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious configuration module with no security risks. All signals indicate benign, static code with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
