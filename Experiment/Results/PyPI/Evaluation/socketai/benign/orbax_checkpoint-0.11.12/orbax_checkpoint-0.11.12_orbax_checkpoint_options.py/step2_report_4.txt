  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a set of data class definitions for configuration purposes. There are no signs of code execution, external data handling, or malicious activity. The code imports a module (`multihost`) but uses it only as a type hint, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports seem consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code as safe, standard configuration code, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly noting the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports justify higher scores; all correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis, which finds no issues.\n\n6. **Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code's static and configuration nature.\n\n7. **Overall assessment:**  \n   The code is a standard configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores reflect this.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is purely declarative, defining data classes for configuration. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The import of `multihost` is a static type hint and does not introduce any risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard configuration code.  \n- Malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.",
