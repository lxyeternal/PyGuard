  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely defining configuration data classes.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The imported module 'multihost' is used solely as a type hint, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard for distributed or ML system configuration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues or vulnerabilities in the code.\n- **Malware suspicion:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, which seems appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n\n- The malware score should be 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, given the code's clarity.\n- The overall security risk should be 0, as the code is purely configuration with no security implications.\n\n**Potential for higher scores?**  \nNo. The code is a standard configuration module, with no suspicious or malicious elements. Assigning higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score      | 0       | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated Score   | 0       | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Risk Score         | 0       | No security risks identified; purely configuration code.  |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and poses no security risk. It is a standard configuration module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk. There is no evidence to suggest any issues or malicious activity.",
