{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration options for checkpoint management APIs such as AsyncCheckpointer and CheckpointManager.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, including 'multihost' from 'orbax.checkpoint._src', and accesses class attributes and default values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily consists of data class definitions and configuration options.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines dataclasses for configuration purposes. There are no input/output operations, network access, or code execution features. The import of 'multihost' is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No sensitive data handling, cryptography, or environment variable use is present. The structure and content align with typical configuration code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration module defining dataclasses for checkpoint management options. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It is safe and purely structural.",
