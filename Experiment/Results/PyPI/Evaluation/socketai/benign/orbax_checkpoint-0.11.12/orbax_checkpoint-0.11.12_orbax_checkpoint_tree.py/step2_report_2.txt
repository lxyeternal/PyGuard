  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a simple module that imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and re-exports them as public symbols.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no input handling, no external communication, and no dynamic code execution.\n- The code contains only licensing comments and import statements, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description and contains only import and export statements. No issues or anomalies are present in the actual code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as a straightforward module setup with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The risk scores are also 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely import/export with no malicious activity, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module for exporting symbols in a Python package. All evidence points to it being safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risking behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0       | No malicious behavior or indicators present.               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       | Clear, straightforward import/export statements.            |\n| Risk            | 0       | No security issues or vulnerabilities evident.             |\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' conclusions.",
