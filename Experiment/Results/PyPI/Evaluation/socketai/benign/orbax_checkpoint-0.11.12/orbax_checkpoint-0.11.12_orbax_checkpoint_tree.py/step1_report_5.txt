  "purpose": "Exports public symbols for the 'tree' module, including types and utility functions related to PyTree structures.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal module paths: orbax.checkpoint._src.tree.types and orbax.checkpoint._src.tree.utils.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only performs imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; the code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports and re-exports types and utility functions from internal modules. No dynamic code execution, user input, or network activity is present. The code is well-structured for module exports without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module import/export code with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
