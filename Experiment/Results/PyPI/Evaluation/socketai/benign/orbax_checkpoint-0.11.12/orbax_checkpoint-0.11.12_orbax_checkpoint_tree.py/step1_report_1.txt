{
  "purpose": "To define and export public symbols for the 'tree' module in the Orbax checkpoint package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules 'orbax.checkpoint._src.tree.types' and 'orbax.checkpoint._src.tree.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements and licensing comments. It imports specific symbols from internal modules and makes them available for external use. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communication features present. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward module initializer for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import/export setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security or contain malicious intent.",
