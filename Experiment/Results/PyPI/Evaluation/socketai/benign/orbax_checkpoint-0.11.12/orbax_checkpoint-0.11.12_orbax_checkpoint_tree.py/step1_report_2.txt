{
  "purpose": "Export public symbols for the 'tree' module in the Orbax library, providing types and utility functions related to PyTrees.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing specific classes and functions from internal modules within 'orbax.checkpoint._src.tree'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and re-exports symbols without processing data or handling untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present; the code is purely for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard licensing comments and imports specific classes and functions from internal modules. It is intended for organizing public API symbols. No data input/output, environment variables, or malicious patterns are detected. The imports are straightforward and are only exporting symbols for other modules to use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for exporting symbols, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
