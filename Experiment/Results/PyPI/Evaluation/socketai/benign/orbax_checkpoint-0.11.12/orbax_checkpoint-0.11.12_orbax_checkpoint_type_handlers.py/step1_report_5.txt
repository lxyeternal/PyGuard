{
  "purpose": "This code module exposes public symbols for the 'type_handlers' submodule of the 'orbax.checkpoint' package, mainly importing various handler classes and utility functions related to serialization and deserialization processes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'orbax.checkpoint._src.serialization.type_handlers' including classes, functions, and deprecated functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or executed are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated functions marked with comments warning 'DON'T USE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING'; no malicious code or backdoors are evident. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The module solely imports and exposes classes and functions from a specific submodule. No input handling, no data processing, no execution of untrusted code. The deprecated functions are clearly marked and intended for internal or advanced use only. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The code structure and comments do not indicate obfuscation or tampering.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward re-export module exposing symbols from a serialization handlers submodule. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The deprecated functions are clearly marked and do not impact the safety of the module.",
