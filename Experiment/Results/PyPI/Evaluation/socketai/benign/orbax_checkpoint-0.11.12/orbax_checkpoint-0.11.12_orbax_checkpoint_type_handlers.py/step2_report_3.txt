  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, correctness of scoring, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Exports various type handler classes/functions; sources are internal module imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted input or dangerous data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Deprecated functions marked clearly; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard symbol export module with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate, no security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on serialization handlers, with no suspicious code or data flow.\n- Deprecated functions are marked, but no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same pattern: imports for symbol exposure, no data flow or untrusted input.\n- Deprecated functions marked.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on the same pattern; no data processing, no network activity.\n- Deprecated functions present but marked.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but justified as the code is mostly benign, and the deprecated functions could cause confusion if misused.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar structure: import/export module with deprecated functions marked.\n- No suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import/export pattern.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1, with the only slight elevation in report 4, justified by cautious interpretation of deprecated functions, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the consistent pattern across all reports, the code is benign, standard for a package's symbol exports, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The deprecated functions are clearly marked, and no suspicious logic is present.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 — fully safe, minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a standard, safe module for symbol re-export with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
