{
  "purpose": "This code exports various serialization type handler classes and functions from internal modules for external use, serving as a public API interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, primarily reading class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Importing from internal modules without runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated functions marked with comments; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements re-exporting classes and functions related to serialization handlers. No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. Deprecated functions are explicitly marked, indicating maintenance but not malicious intent. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for symbol re-export within a Python package. It does not contain malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The deprecated functions are clearly marked and do not pose a threat. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
