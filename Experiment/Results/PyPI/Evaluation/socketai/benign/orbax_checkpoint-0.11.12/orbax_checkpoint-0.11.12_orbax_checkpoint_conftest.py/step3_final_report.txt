  "purpose": "Configure pytest environment with absl flags during testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'config' parameter passed to 'pytest_configure' and calls 'flags.FLAGS.mark_as_parsed()'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only manipulates internal flag state.",
  "flows": "Input: 'config' parameter; Output: 'flags.FLAGS.mark_as_parsed()' indicating flags are set.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward pytest setup snippet. The 'del config' is benign and common in test configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'flags' from 'absl', defines a pytest configuration function that deletes the 'config' parameter to prevent further use, and marks flags as parsed to avoid flag parsing errors during tests. It performs no data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard for test setup and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest configuration snippet used in testing environments. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
