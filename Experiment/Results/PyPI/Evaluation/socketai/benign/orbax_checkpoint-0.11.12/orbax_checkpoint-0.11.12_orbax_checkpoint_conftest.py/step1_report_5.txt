  "purpose": "Configure pytest settings and mark flags as parsed in a testing environment.",
  "sources": "Import statement for absl.flags and the function parameter 'config' as a source of input.",
  "sinks": "The 'flags.FLAGS.mark_as_parsed()' method call which manipulates the flags state.",
  "flows": "The function 'pytest_configure' receives 'config' and then calls 'mark_as_parsed' on global flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard configuration tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest configuration script that uses the absl.flags library. It imports necessary modules, defines a configuration function, and marks command-line flags as parsed. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The usage of 'flags.FLAGS.mark_as_parsed()' is typical for suppressing flag parsing errors in test setups. The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate pytest configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
