  "purpose": "Configure pytest with absl flags parsing.",
  "sources": "Import of 'flags' from 'absl' and 'config' parameter in 'pytest_configure' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply sets up configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code behavior, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal pytest configuration script that imports 'flags' from 'absl' and modifies a configuration object. It marks flags as parsed without performing any data processing, validation, or network operations. The code contains standard licensing and licensing comments, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest configuration snippet that does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe.",
