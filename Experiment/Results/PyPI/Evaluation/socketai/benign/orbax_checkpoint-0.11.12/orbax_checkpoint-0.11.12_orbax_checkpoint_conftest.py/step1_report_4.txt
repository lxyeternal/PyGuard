  "flows": "Input source (imported flags) → usage of mark_as_parsed() to modify flag state",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up pytest configuration and marks flags as parsed, which is a typical setup step when using absl flags in testing. No input or external data sources are involved. No data leaks, malicious actions, or security flaws are present. The only notable action is marking flags as parsed, which is benign and standard practice. No anomalies, malware indicators, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration snippet using absl flags with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
