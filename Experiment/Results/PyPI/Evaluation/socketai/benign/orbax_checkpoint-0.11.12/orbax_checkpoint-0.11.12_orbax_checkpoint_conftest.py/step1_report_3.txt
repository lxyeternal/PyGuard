  "purpose": "Configure pytest settings and mark flags as parsed for test environment setup.",
  "sources": "Imports and function parameter 'config'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of 'del' on function parameter is benign. The code simply sets a flag state.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a function to configure pytest. It deletes the 'config' parameter, which is harmless. The only notable action is marking flags as parsed using the absl library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The license headers are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward configuration for testing with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be legitimate setup code.",
