{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom JSON encoder class to serialize datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "Imports datetime module; uses standard json.JSONEncoder for serialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses default serialization method, no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code purely defines a class for encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation of a JSON encoder subclass.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom JSON encoder for datetime objects. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with a default method override to serialize datetime objects, and falls back to the default JSON encoder behavior otherwise. No user input, external data sources, or sensitive operations are involved. The code does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations. It adheres to common coding practices for extending JSON serialization capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of a custom JSON encoder. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is typical of a utility module for data serialization.",
