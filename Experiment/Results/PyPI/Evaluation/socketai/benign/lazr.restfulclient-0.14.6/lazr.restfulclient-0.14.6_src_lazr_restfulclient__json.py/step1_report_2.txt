{
  "purpose": "Provide a custom JSON encoder that serializes datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "Importing datetime module, the default() method called during JSON encoding.",
  "sinks": "The default() method may process any object passed to JSON serialization, potentially handling untrusted data if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Data passed to JSONEncoder.encode() flows through default(), which processes datetime objects. No external input is explicitly handled in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and appears standard for a custom encoder.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder to handle datetime objects specifically, converting them to ISO 8601 strings. It does not process external input directly or perform any network or system operations. The import and class are typical for extending JSON encoding. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension of JSON encoding to support datetime objects, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
