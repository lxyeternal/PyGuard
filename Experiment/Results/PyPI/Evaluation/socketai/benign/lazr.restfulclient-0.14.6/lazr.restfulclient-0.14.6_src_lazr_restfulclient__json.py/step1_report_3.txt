  "purpose": "Defines a custom JSON encoder class for serializing datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "Import statements for datetime module and JSONEncoder class; no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external systems or processed for security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks since the code is solely defining a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports datetime and JSONEncoder, then defines a subclass that formats datetime objects as ISO strings during JSON serialization. No user input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious operations. It functions solely as a utility class for encoding objects, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for JSON encoding datetime objects. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured piece of code with no malicious intent.",
