{
  "purpose": "Provides a JSON encoder subclass that serializes datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; uses standard library datetime objects within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static utility class, no data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of JSONEncoder overriding default() to serialize datetime.datetime objects with isoformat(). It involves no external data, network operations, or security-sensitive handling. The implementation is correct, simple, and uses standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security flaws are present. The code serves as a utility for JSON serialization of datetime objects, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility class with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
