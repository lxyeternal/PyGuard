{
  "purpose": "To provide a custom JSON encoder that serializes datetime objects in ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "Importing datetime module, class initialization, the default method accessing datetime.datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "The default method potentially outputs datetime objects as ISO strings, but does not interact with untrusted data sources or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Datetime objects are passed to the default method which encodes them as ISO strings for JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious external interactions, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class extending JSONEncoder to handle datetime objects. It does not read untrusted input, interact with external systems, or perform any network or system modifications. The implementation appears standard and secure. No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. It only customizes JSON serialization for datetime objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-defined JSON encoder extension with no malicious or security concern signs. It is safe and intended for proper serialization of datetime objects in JSON.",
