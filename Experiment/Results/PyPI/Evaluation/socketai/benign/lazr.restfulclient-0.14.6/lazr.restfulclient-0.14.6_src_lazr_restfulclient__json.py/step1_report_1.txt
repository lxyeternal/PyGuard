  "purpose": "Defines a JSON encoder class that serializes datetime objects into ISO 8601 format.",
  "sources": "Imports from the datetime module and the json module; no external input sources are present.",
  "targets": "The class serializes datetime objects; no data sinks or output targets involved.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—code only defines a class without data flow logic or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass of JSONEncoder that formats datetime objects as ISO 8601 strings. It contains standard imports, class definition, and a default method override. No external inputs, outputs, or side effects are present. The code aligns with typical practices and appears safe. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for JSON serialization of datetime objects, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
