  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the lazr.restfulclient Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for description, reading documentation files in generate(), and package metadata defined in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only reads files and sets package metadata",
  "flows": "Reading files for long_description and description, then passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard setup tools without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools modules, defines a helper for reading documentation files, and configures the package setup with static and some file-based content. There are no signs of malicious code, external data exfiltration, or obfuscated behavior. All file reads are from local files, and the setup configuration appears standard. No source-to-sink data flows involve untrusted inputs; the code only reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads documentation files for description purposes and configures package installation parameters securely.",
