  "purpose": "Set up configuration and metadata for the lazr.restfulclient Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, reading documentation files, importing setup tools and package discovery functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; it only reads files for descriptions and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from external sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for Python packaging. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution. It reads documentation files for descriptions, specifies dependencies with environment markers, and sets project URLs. No code execution, data collection, network activity, or dynamic code evaluation is present. The code adheres to typical setup script standards and contains no obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is used for package configuration and distribution purposes only.",
