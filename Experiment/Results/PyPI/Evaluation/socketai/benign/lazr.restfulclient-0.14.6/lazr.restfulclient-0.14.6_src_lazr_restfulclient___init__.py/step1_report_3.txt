{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and assign the version of the 'lazr.restfulclient' package using importlib.metadata, with compatibility for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata (or importlib_metadata if importlib.metadata is unavailable)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "Importing version information from the package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; license comments are standard and benign",
  "analysis": "The code begins with license comments, then attempts to import importlib.metadata for modern Python versions. If ImportError occurs, it falls back to importlib_metadata for older versions. It then retrieves the version of the specified package 'lazr.restfulclient' and assigns it to __version__. The code is straightforward, utilizing standard library functions with appropriate fallback, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package version retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
