  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'lazr.restfulclient' package with compatibility handling for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata modules, version retrieval function",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> calling version() -> assigning to __version__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version retrieval with standard fallback pattern",
  "analysis": "The code performs a compatibility check between importlib.metadata (Python 3.8+) and its backport importlib_metadata, then retrieves the package version. It contains no untrusted input, no external data flows, no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The purpose is solely to assign the package version to __version__, with proper licensing comments. The code is minimal, clear, and widely used in open source projects. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for package version retrieval with compatibility handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, no obfuscation, and poses no security risk. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified.",
