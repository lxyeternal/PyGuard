  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and fetches version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version retrieval script that handles import differences between Python versions. It uses try-except for compatibility and assigns the package version to __version__. No external input, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package version fetcher with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
