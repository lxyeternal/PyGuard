{
  "purpose": "To retrieve the version information of the 'lazr.restfulclient' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version() or importlib_metadata.version() depending on the environment.",
  "sinks": "The retrieved version string is stored in the __version__ variable; no sinks that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The source (importlib_metadata.version) flows into assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code includes a fallback import for importlib_metadata, which is standard practice for compatibility across Python versions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation for obtaining package version information. It includes a compatibility check for different Python versions. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It only performs a benign operation related to package metadata retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe snippet to get the package version, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
