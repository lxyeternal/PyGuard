  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to identify any discrepancies, logical flaws, or security concerns.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, benign version retrieval snippet.\n- The code uses a try-except block to import `importlib.metadata` (Python 3.8+) or fallback to `importlib_metadata` (older Python versions).\n- The version of the package `lazr.restfulclient` is retrieved via `importlib.metadata.version()` or `importlib_metadata.version()` and assigned to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code is standard and functionally correct. It performs a simple import and version retrieval. No issues are present.\n\n- **Malicious intent or malware:**  \n  The code does not execute any untrusted code, process external data, or contain obfuscated/malicious patterns. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Security risks:**  \n  The code is benign, with no external data handling or insecure operations. The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the scores:\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward. Obfuscation score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Malware:**  \n  No malicious behavior detected. Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code only retrieves package version info and handles compatibility, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Logical consistency and assumptions:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a standard pattern for package version retrieval.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made without evidence.\n- The fallback import pattern is common and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, all reports are accurate and consistent with the code.**  \nThe code is a benign, compatibility-aware snippet for retrieving package version information, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
