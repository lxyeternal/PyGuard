  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'lazr.restfulclient' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(\"lazr.restfulclient\")",
  "sinks": "The version information retrieval could potentially leak package version details, but it does not directly lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Importing importlib.metadata (or importlib_metadata) then calling version() on 'lazr.restfulclient'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code handles ImportError gracefully to maintain compatibility across Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing comments, then attempts to import importlib.metadata for Python 3.8+ to retrieve package version info. If that import fails (indicating an older Python version), it falls back to the 'importlib_metadata' backport. It then assigns the package version to __version__. This is standard practice for version retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No untrusted input, data leaks, or malicious code execution are present. The code appears to be a benign utility snippet for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation for obtaining package version information with backward compatibility. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activities detected.",
