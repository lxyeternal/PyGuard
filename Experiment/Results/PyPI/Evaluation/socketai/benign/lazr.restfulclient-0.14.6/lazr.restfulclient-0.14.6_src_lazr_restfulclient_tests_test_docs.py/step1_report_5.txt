{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a test harness for running doctests, including WSGI application intercepts, resource management, and test loading.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, atexit, doctest, wsgi_intercept, pkg_resources, etc.), resource and file handling functions, and functions like setUp, tearDown, find_doctests, load_tests.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or execute untrusted input data; it manages resources and executes tests with predefined data.",
  "flows": "No direct untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; resource list and filename functions could be influenced by filesystem content, but no external input is processed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard testing setup and resource cleanup with no unusual or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical testing harness for Python doctests. It imports necessary modules, sets up WSGI intercepts, manages resources via cleanup functions, and loads test files matching specific suffixes. No external input handling or sensitive data processing occurs. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious flows are detected. All functions perform standard testing utilities without side effects that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for test environment configuration and resource management.",
