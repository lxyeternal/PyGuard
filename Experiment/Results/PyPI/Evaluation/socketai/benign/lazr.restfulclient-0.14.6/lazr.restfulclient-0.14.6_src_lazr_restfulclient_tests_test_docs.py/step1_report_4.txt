{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a test harness for doctests, including resource management, WSGI interception, and test suite loading.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as os, atexit, doctest, wsgi_intercept, pkg_resources, and functions from lazr.restful and wsgi_intercept. Uses resource_exists, resource_listdir, resource_filename to access documentation files.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writing, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code loads test files, sets up and tears down WSGI intercepts, and registers cleanup functions. No flow of untrusted data to critical sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard test setup and resource management tasks without unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a test environment with resource cleanup, file resource discovery, and WSGI intercept setup. It uses established modules and follows typical testing patterns. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. It only manages local resources and test execution flow, with no data exfiltration or harmful system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe test harness for documentation and integration testing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It adheres to standard testing practices without suspicious anomalies.",
