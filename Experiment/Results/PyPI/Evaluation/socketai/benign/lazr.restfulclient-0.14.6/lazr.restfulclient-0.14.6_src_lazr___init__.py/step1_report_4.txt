  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the lazr.restfulclient package to enable proper package resource management.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs imports and namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The license comment is standard and does not affect execution.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import pkg_resources to declare a namespace for the package. If import fails, it falls back to using pkgutil to extend the package path. This is a common pattern for namespace packages in Python. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The code contains only standard import and namespace declaration logic with no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
