  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward namespace package setup.\n- The code involves importing standard modules (`pkg_resources` and `pkgutil`) and declaring or extending the namespace.\n- There are no signs of data handling, user input, external network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The license comments are standard and do not introduce any security concerns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard pattern used in Python for namespace packages.\n- The fallback from `pkg_resources` to `pkgutil` is a common practice.\n- No anomalies, unusual behavior, or potential vulnerabilities are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified, as the code does not perform any risky operations or handle untrusted data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and secure.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a textbook example of namespace package declaration with no security issues.",
