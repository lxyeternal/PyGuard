  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Standard namespace declaration with no unusual behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares a namespace package using standard Python practices. It attempts to import pkg_resources to declare a namespace, and falls back to pkgutil if ImportError occurs. Both are standard library or widely used packages. There is no user input, no data processing, and no suspicious code behavior. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
