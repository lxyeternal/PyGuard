{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and API errors in the lazr.restfulclient library.",
  "sources": "The code primarily defines classes and functions; it does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data directly; it creates exception objects based on response data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code maps response statuses to exception classes but does not process or execute external untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward exception class definitions and a status code handler.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for various HTTP errors and a function to map HTTP response status codes to these exceptions. It includes no dynamic code execution, no data leakage, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors. The function 'error_for' interprets response codes to generate appropriate exceptions, which is standard practice. There are no indications of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. The licensing comments are standard and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for HTTP error handling within a client library. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
