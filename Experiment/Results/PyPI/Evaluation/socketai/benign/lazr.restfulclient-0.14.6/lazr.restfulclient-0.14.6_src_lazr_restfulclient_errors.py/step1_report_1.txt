  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP errors and responses in the lazr.restfulclient library.",
  "sources": "None (standard exception class definitions and a helper function for error instantiation).",
  "sinks": "The function error_for may instantiate different exception classes based on response status, but it does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "flows": "error_for uses response.status to select an exception class and returns an instance of it, based on the response code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behaviors observed. The code is standard exception class definitions with a straightforward error handling function.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to map HTTP response statuses to custom exception classes, aiding in error handling. There is no code that reads untrusted input in an unsafe manner, nor does it perform any network or system operations that could be malicious. The error_for function is a typical pattern for error handling based on HTTP response codes. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard error handling logic for an HTTP client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
