{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and an error handling function for the lazr.restfulclient API library, primarily for HTTP response error management.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, constructor parameters, and response data passed into the error_for function.",
  "sinks": "The error_for function may instantiate exception classes based on response status; response and content data are stored in exceptions but are not directly used as untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "Response status code determines the flow: non-2xx responses lead to creation of specific error objects, which include response and content data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code follows standard pattern for custom exceptions and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various custom exception classes related to HTTP error responses and a function error_for to map response status codes to these exceptions. The class definitions are straightforward, inheriting from base Exception classes, with no dynamic or unsafe code involved. The error_for function relies on the response status to instantiate appropriate error objects, passing response and content data, but this is standard error handling practice. There are no hardcoded credentials, code injection points, or malicious constructs. The code does not perform any network operations or handle untrusted input directly, and it does not manipulate environment variables or system files. Overall, this code appears to be purely for structured error handling, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom error classes and an error mapping function for HTTP responses. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions as a benign part of a client library for error management.",
