  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes and an error handler.\n- Source/Sink: No external data processing; straightforward class definitions.\n- Anomalies: None observed.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern; no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (minimal).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above; exception classes and error mapping.\n- Source/Sink: No external input processing; straightforward.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard error handling; no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Source/Sink: No external data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical exception hierarchy; no malicious logic.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard pattern.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes and error handler.\n- Source/Sink: No unsafe data handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward; no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes and error mapping.\n- Source/Sink: No external data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern; no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. All reports describe standard exception class definitions and an error mapping function, with no code executing untrusted input, network activity, or system modifications.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; primarily involves error handling, which is standard.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (error handling classes), a risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, as it is minimal and typical for such code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes and an error handling function for an HTTP client library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are recommended to the scores based on the provided information.",
