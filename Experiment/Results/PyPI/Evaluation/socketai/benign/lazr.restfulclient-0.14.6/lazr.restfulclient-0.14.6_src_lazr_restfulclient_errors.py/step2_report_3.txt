  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, suspicious elements, or potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes and a helper function; no external input or malicious actions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, straightforward, with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, no external data processing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also accurate, the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes and error mapping; no external input.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior or anomalies detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a typical error handling pattern, safe and benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines error classes and an error generator function.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard pattern.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or risky behavior observed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, no external data or dynamic code execution.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious operations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard error handling, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is purely class definitions and a mapping function for HTTP errors. It does not read untrusted input in an unsafe manner, does not perform network or system operations, nor executes any code dynamically.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- **Security Risks:** The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is justified as the code is a benign error handling module.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (standard error handling code with minimal risk, no attack vectors)\n\n---\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code, and the reasoning is sound. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is a typical, safe implementation of error classes and an error mapping function, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious intent.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- No further action or concern is warranted.",
