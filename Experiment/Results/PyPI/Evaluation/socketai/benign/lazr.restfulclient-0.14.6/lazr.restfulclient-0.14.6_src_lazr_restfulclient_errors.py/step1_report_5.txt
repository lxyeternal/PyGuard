  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the lazr.restfulclient API, including various HTTP error responses.",
  "sources": "The module reads class definitions and the function error_for, which accesses response attributes such as response.status, response.reason, and response.items().",
  "sinks": "The function error_for constructs and returns exception instances based on response status and attributes. The __str__ methods in error classes format error messages using response attributes.",
  "flows": "The error_for function takes response and content, inspects response.status, and creates instances of specific error classes, passing response and content to their constructors. The __str__ methods access response attributes for string representation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard error handling patterns. No suspicious network operations or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for handling HTTP errors, with specific classes for common HTTP status codes. The function error_for maps response status codes to appropriate exception classes, returning instances for error status codes and None for successful responses. The __str__ methods format error messages using response details. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python practices for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of error handling classes for an HTTP client library. It contains no malicious intent, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears safe and benign.",
