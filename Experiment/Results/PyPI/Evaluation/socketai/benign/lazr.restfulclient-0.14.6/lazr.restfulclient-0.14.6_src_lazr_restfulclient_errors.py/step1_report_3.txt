  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and API errors within the lazr.restfulclient library.",
  "sources": "The code defines classes and functions directly within the file; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The function error_for processes HTTP response objects and content to generate exception instances, but does not execute untrusted code or leak data.",
  "flows": "The error_for function takes response and content as inputs and maps response status to specific exception classes, then returns instances accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward exception handling logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured set of exception classes related to HTTP errors, with a utility function to instantiate appropriate error objects based on HTTP response status. No user input parsing, unsafe code execution, or network activity occurs. The function only creates and returns error instances. The class hierarchy and function are standard for error handling. No anomalies or malicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module for a REST client library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It simply maps HTTP response statuses to custom exception classes. Overall, it appears safe and free from malicious intent.",
