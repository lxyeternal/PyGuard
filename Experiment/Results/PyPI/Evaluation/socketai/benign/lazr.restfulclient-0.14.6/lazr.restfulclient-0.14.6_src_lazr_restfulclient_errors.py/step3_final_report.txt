{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for HTTP errors and provides a function to map HTTP responses to appropriate exception instances.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'response' object, specifically 'response.status', 'response.reason', and 'response.items()'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects; it only creates exception objects based on response attributes.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the 'response' object attributes to the selection of exception classes, resulting in the instantiation of exception objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for HTTP error handling, with a mapping function that returns appropriate exceptions based on response status codes. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common patterns in HTTP client libraries. No malicious or suspicious elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard error handling module for an HTTP client, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.1 due to its role in error management.",
