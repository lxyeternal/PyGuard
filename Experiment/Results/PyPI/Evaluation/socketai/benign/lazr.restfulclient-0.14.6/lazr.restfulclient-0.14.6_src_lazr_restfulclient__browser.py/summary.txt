  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard REST client with caching, retries, and SSL validation controls. No malicious or obfuscated content is detected. The main security consideration is the environment variable to disable SSL validation, which introduces a moderate risk if exploited. Overall, the code appears secure and well-implemented, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a risk score around 0.3 reflecting the SSL validation toggle."
