  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides OAuth classes, handles credentials securely, and performs standard request signing. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The use of TruthyString is a workaround, not malicious. Credential handling appears secure. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. The low risk score (0.2) reflects minor concerns about credential storage, but overall, the code is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard credential management, request signing, and system info-based consumer key generation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malicious activity. Use of system info for consumer key is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard OAuth implementation, credential management, and request signing. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The lower risk score (0.1) is justified given the standard practices and absence of suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes potential security concerns with plain text credential storage, but no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The mention of insecure credential storage is valid but does not imply malicious intent. The code's core functions are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score could be slightly higher if considering insecure credential storage, but since it’s not malicious, 0.2 remains acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing legitimate OAuth functionality, proper credential handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which is accurate. The code performs standard OAuth credential management and request signing without any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly between 0.1 and 0.2. The only concern is the insecure handling of credentials in plain text files, which is a security best practice issue but not malicious.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to insecure credential storage, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate OAuth utility with no malware or malicious intent. The only concern is the insecure storage of credentials, which is a known security issue but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I confirm that the code does not contain any malicious payload, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The scores should remain low across all categories, with a slight increase in risk due to credential storage practices.",
