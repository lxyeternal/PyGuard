{
  "purpose": "The code imports two functions, get_generator_filename and test_generator, from a local module named _readers.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which accesses the local module _readers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet as it only involves import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this small snippet; it only imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no obvious anomalies or suspicious patterns. The module name '_readers' suggests it is a private or internal module.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a straightforward import statement from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. Since the code only imports functions, there are no direct risks or malicious intent visible here. However, without the implementation of _readers, it's impossible to fully assess potential malicious code within those functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign; it simply imports functions from a local module. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent at this level. Further review of the _readers module is recommended if concerns persist.",
