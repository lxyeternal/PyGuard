  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, whether the scores align with the content, and if any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a simple import statement from a local module `_readers`.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity.\n- The functions' implementations are unknown, but the import statement itself is benign.\n- The risk scores assigned are very low, which aligns with the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states that it's a straightforward import with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.5.\n- **Assessment:** Given the minimal code, the low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. The confidence is moderate; since no further context is provided, this is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Also correctly identifies the import as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence score is justified given the simplicity and benign nature. No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to previous, benign import statement.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Very high confidence is appropriate here; the code is clearly safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same benign import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes the import is benign, recommends further review of `_readers` if needed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher security risk score (0.1) is reasonable considering the module `_readers` could contain malicious code, but based solely on the import statement, there's no evidence of malicious activity. The confidence is moderate, which is appropriate given the limited snippet.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n\n- **Malware:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero, no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** Very low across all reports, justified by the minimal code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the uniformity of the code snippet and the consistent conclusions, I agree with the current scores. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues solely from this import statement.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, mainly due to the unknown nature of `_readers` module, but no evidence of danger)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current reports and scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of `_readers` for any malicious code if concerns persist, but based solely on this import statement, the code is safe.",
