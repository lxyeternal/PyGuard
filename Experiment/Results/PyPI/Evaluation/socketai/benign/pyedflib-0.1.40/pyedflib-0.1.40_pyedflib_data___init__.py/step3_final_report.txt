{
  "purpose": "This code imports two functions from a local module '_readers', likely for use within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local '_readers' module, which may contain the definitions of 'get_generator_filename' and 'test_generator'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the import simply makes functions available for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The functions' internal implementations are unknown, so potential risks cannot be fully assessed, but the snippet itself is benign. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given the minimal context. The confidence in benignity is high, as no suspicious activity is evident. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is absent.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no further action is necessary unless the internal '_readers' module is found to contain malicious code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
