  "purpose": "Import functions 'get_generator_filename' and 'test_generator' from a local module '_readers'.",
  "sources": "Module import statement, specifically from a relative module '_readers'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports functions from '_readers' module; no data flow or untrusted input processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing two functions from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity in this minimal snippet. The functions' implementations are not provided, so potential malicious behavior cannot be assessed further. The code appears to serve a normal purpose in a Python project, likely to use these functions elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious activity or security risks. It performs standard module importing with no suspicious elements.",
