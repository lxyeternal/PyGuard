  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement importing two functions from a local module `_readers`. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation within this snippet. Since the code is minimal, no issues are directly observable here.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They acknowledge the limited scope and correctly state that without the implementation of `_readers`, malicious activity cannot be definitively ruled out. No logical flaws or errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.1-0.2; given the minimal code, this is reasonable.  \n- **Confidence Levels:** Vary between 0.5 and 1, reflecting uncertainty due to limited context, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is only an import statement with no evidence of malicious intent, a risk score higher than 0.1-0.2 is unwarranted. The minimal nature of the code and the lack of suspicious activity justify low risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions beyond the limited scope. They acknowledge that further review of `_readers` might be necessary if concerns persist, which is a prudent stance.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code snippet and the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected or suggested.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, reflecting minimal risk due to limited context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- If further context becomes available (e.g., contents of `_readers`), reassessment should be performed.\n- For now, the current scores and analysis are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a benign import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the information.",
