  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this limited snippet; potential flow involves imported functions if used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal import statement that references a local module '_readers'. Without additional code, no malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity can be inferred. The functions imported could perform various tasks, but their content and behavior are unknown from this snippet alone. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or insecure practices evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations or data handling on its own.",
