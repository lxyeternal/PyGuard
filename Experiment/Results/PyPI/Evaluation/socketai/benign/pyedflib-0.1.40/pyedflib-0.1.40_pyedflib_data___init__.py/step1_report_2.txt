{
  "purpose": "The code imports two functions, get_generator_filename and test_generator, from a local module named _readers. The purpose is likely related to reading or testing data generators, possibly in a data processing or machine learning context.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module (_readers) within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only imports functions, no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow, input, or output operations are performed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, and there are no visible anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. It is a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of two functions from a relative module within the package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. As the snippet is very small, it lacks context but appears benign. No insecure patterns or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. It appears to be part of a larger project and does not perform any harmful operations itself.",
