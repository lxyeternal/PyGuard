{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions 'get_generator_filename' and 'test_generator' from a local module '_readers'. Its purpose is likely related to file handling or data processing in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '_readers'. No other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input identified in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected. The module name '_readers' suggests internal functionality, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The snippet imports functions from a local module, indicating modular code structure. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling. The functions imported could be used elsewhere for legitimate purposes. Given the limited code, no malicious behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice in Python projects.",
