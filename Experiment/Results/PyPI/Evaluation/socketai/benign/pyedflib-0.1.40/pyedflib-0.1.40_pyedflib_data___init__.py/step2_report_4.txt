  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that this is a simple import statement with no malicious activity. The confidence is moderate (0.5), which is reasonable given the minimal code. Malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.1).\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues here. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a higher confidence (0.9). The analysis emphasizes benignity, which aligns with the code snippet. Malware and security risk scores are 0 and 0, respectively.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a straightforward import with high confidence (1). The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—benign import statement, high confidence (0.9). The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.7), but the reasoning remains consistent. The security risk is 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal code.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is a simple import statement. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior in the provided fragment.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** Since the functions are imported from a local module `_readers`, their actual implementation could be relevant. However, based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assign malware scores of 0, reflecting no malicious behavior. Security risk scores are low, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and lack of suspicious activity, a risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is acceptable, but not higher.\n\n- **Additional notes:** To be thorough, reviewing the actual `_readers` module's implementation could be necessary if future concerns arise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code snippet.\n- No anomalies, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, reflecting a benign, straightforward import statement with no security concerns.",
