{
  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the pyEDFlib Python package, including compiling extensions and handling dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, subprocess, sys, sysconfig, setuptools, numpy), functions for version control and environment setup, code that reads and modifies C source files, environment variable checks, and dynamic import of numpy.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen (git version retrieval), file writing operations (version.py, egg links), dynamic code execution (exec_module), and modification of C source files.",
  "flows": "Input environment variables and file system states influence the conditional logic and file modifications. Data read from system environment, files, and subprocess outputs flow into version info and source code modifications. Data from dependencies (numpy, git) influence build configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies C source files directly on Windows for patching; this is unusual but not inherently malicious. The dynamic import and fetch of numpy, conditional environment checks, and the use of subprocess for git rev-parse are standard in build scripts, not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The script does not include obfuscated or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks such as dependency checks, version retrieval from git, patching C source files for Windows, and dynamic extension compilation. It uses common build patterns like environment variable checks and dynamic module loading. No suspicious network activity beyond retrieving git revision info is evident. File modifications are confined to build processes, and no runtime malicious behavior is apparent. The script's actions align with legitimate build processes, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python extension package with no indications of malicious or sabotage behavior. It handles dependencies, versioning, and build procedures securely and transparently. No malicious signals detected.",
