  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script for a Python package with native extensions. No malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors are detected. The use of subprocess for versioning and platform-specific source modifications are standard practices. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the obfuscation score is zero. The overall supply chain security posture of this code is sound."
