  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the pyEDFlib Python package, managing dependencies, versioning, platform-specific adjustments, and extension compilation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, calls subprocess to 'git rev-parse HEAD', reads files for version info, modifies C source files on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Writes version info to a Python file, modifies C source files, executes subprocess commands for version control.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, files, subprocess outputs) lead to version file writing, source code modifications, and subprocess execution.",
  "anomalies": "Modification of C source files on Windows for compatibility; use of subprocess to call 'git' during build; dynamic import of version info; no suspicious secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and setup tasks, including dependency management, version control via git, platform-specific source modifications, and version info generation. The subprocess call to 'git' is typical for versioning in development environments. Modifying source files on Windows is a common compatibility step. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The use of dynamic imports and file writes are standard in build scripts. Overall, the script exhibits typical behavior for a Python extension package setup, with no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script for a Python package with native extensions. No malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors are detected. The use of subprocess for versioning and platform-specific source modifications are standard practices. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the obfuscation score is zero. The overall supply chain security posture of this code is sound.",
