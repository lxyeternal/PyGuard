{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for handling EDF (European Data Format) files, including imports and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_extensions._pyedflib, edfwriter, edfreader, highlevel, data) and version info from pyedflib.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present; no data leaks or external communications are initiated.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up module imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file for a Python package, importing necessary modules and setting the __all__ list for exports. It includes copyright notices and license info. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted inputs, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The package appears to be a legitimate library related to EDF file processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an initialization script for a package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks.",
