  "purpose": "Package initialization (__init__.py) importing internal modules and defining public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_extensions._pyedflib, edfwriter, edfreader, highlevel, data), version info, and license comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package __init__.py file with straightforward imports, license comments, version info, and __all__ definition. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The import pattern is standard for package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
