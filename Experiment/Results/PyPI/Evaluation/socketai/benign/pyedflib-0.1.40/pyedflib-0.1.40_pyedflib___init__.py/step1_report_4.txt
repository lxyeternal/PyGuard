{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to EDF (European Data Format) file handling, including imports of modules and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_extensions._pyedflib, edfwriter, edfreader, highlevel, data) and version import from pyedflib.version.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no functions, network calls, or data handling beyond imports.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and sets __all__ for public interface, with no data flow or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; import statements are standard for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and license comments. It imports various internal modules and sets the public API. There are no functions, data processing, or network interactions. It appears to be standard package initialization code, with no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations that could harm or leak data; it solely imports modules and defines the public API.",
