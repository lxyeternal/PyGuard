{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an initialization or import module for the pyedflib package, designed to expose certain components and manage versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_extensions._pyedflib, edfwriter, edfreader, highlevel, data) and the version information from pyedflib.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily imports modules and sets the __all__ list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply re-exports components and defines the public API.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer for the pyedflib library, importing internal components and setting up the public API via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The presence of copyright comments and version management is standard. No sources or sinks that could be exploited are evident, and there are no unusual code constructs or obfuscation. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports components and sets up exports. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
