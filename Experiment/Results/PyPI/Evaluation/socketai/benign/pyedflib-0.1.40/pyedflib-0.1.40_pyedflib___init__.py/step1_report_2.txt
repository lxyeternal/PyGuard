{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up imports and module exports for a Python library related to EDF (European Data Format) files, likely for reading, writing, and high-level operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_extensions._pyedflib, edfwriter, edfreader, highlevel, data) and the version information from pyedflib.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or untrusted data handling, as the code only performs static imports and defines the __all__ list.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths are present; this is a setup/configuration script without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The only notable aspect is broad wildcard import of all symbols from internal modules, which could be considered risky in a different context but is common in package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The script imports internal modules and sets up the public API via __all__. No user input, external data, or runtime data processing is present. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is observed. The code structure aligns with typical package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard package initialization script for a Python library related to EDF file handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
