{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface to read and extract data from EDF, EDF+, BDF, and BDF+ files, including metadata and signal data, for medical or scientific analysis.",
  "sources": "File reading operations in _debug_parse_header, open(filename, 'rb'), and various getter methods that access file metadata or signal data.",
  "sinks": "None evident. The code primarily reads data; it does not write or execute untrusted input directly. No direct data leaks or command execution paths are present.",
  "flows": "Input from file streams flows into header parsing, metadata extraction, and signal data retrieval functions. No user input or network data flows are processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code adheres to typical data extraction and processing patterns for EDF files. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or suspicious strings are present.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates reading of medical signal files, with functions for parsing headers, extracting annotations, and retrieving signal data and metadata. It uses standard file handling and data processing methods without executing external commands, writing data, or transmitting information externally. The functions are straightforward, and no malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. The only notable aspect is the use of warnings during string decoding, which is benign and for robustness. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, legitimate library for reading EDF/BDF files, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for data extraction and metadata access, adhering to typical safe patterns.",
