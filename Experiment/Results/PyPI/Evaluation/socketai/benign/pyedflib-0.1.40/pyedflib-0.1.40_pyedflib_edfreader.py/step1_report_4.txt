{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python interface for reading and processing EDF, EDF+, BDF, and BDF+ files, including extracting headers, annotations, signals, and metadata.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations, attribute accessors for metadata, and signal data extraction methods.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from methods like readAnnotations, readSignal, and getHeader; file handling functions.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files via open/read operations, processed internally, and returned to the caller; no untrusted data flows directly into sensitive sinks without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network or system commands; some warnings used, but not malicious; no hidden backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard file reading, data processing, and metadata extraction functions, with proper error handling for index bounds. No evidence of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The only potential concern might be the file read operations, but these are intended for legitimate data extraction. No dynamic code execution, suspicious URL calls, or credential handling are present. The code appears well-structured and consistent with standard data handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an EDF/BDF file reader, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly reads data and metadata from files, with proper data validation and error handling. No malicious behaviors or sabotage detected.",
