{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for reading EDF, EDF+, BDF, and BDF+ files, extracting headers, annotations, signal data, and metadata for medical signal analysis.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations such as open/read in _debug_parse_header; attribute access for patient info, annotations, signal headers, and data; functions like read_annotation(), getLabel(), readSignal().",
  "sinks": "Exposing patient identifiers, annotations, signal labels, and raw signal data via getter functions; potential privacy exposure but no malicious data exfiltration or external communication.",
  "flows": "File content read into internal variables, then accessible via functions returning headers, annotations, signal data, or metadata; no external network or command execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of _debug_parse_header() which reads raw binary data for debugging purposes; no obfuscation or malicious code detected; minor typo in readSignal() calling self.readsignal() (lowercase 's') which could cause runtime error but not security issue.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured library for reading and parsing medical signal files, with functions for accessing headers, annotations, and signals. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The debug function _debug_parse_header, while reading raw binary data, is intended for debugging and not malicious. The functions expose sensitive patient data, but this is inherent to the library's purpose. The typo in readSignal() is a minor bug but does not impact security. Overall, the code demonstrates legitimate functionality with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent library for medical signal file reading, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor debug utility and data exposure are expected for its purpose. The security risk is minimal, primarily privacy-related, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero.",
