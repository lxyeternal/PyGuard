  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent library for medical signal file reading, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor debug utility and data exposure are expected for its purpose. The security risk is minimal, primarily privacy-related, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero."
