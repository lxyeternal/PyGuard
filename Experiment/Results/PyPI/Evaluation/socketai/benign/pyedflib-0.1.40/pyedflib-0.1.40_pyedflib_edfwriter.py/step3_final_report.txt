{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class for creating and managing EDF/BDF files, handling headers, signal data, and annotations with validation and external C/C++ extension calls.",
  "sources": "Header fields, signal configuration dictionaries, data buffers, and input parameters such as start time, patient info, and signal properties.",
  "sinks": "External C extension functions that perform file writing, header setting, and data conversion; no network or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and configuration methods update internal state; validation functions check data integrity; data writing functions pass buffers to external C functions for file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Deprecation warnings for some functions are noted but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation for EDF/BDF file writing, relying on external libraries for file I/O. Validation routines ensure data correctness, and no malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1) is justified by standard validation and external dependencies. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent implementation for handling biomedical signal files. It shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, and the risk level is minimal.",
