{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class for writing EDF/BDF files, managing headers, signals, annotations, and data writing functions for biosignal recordings.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters, class attributes, and external modules (e.g., open_file_writeonly, set_* functions, data arrays). It also reads configuration and signal information from user input via setters.",
  "sinks": "Uses external library functions (e.g., write_physical_samples, write_digital_samples, write_annotation_utf8, write_annotation_latin1) which are interface points to the underlying file operations and possibly system calls, but these are not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (signal data, header info, annotations) through validation and processing, then via external library functions to be written into files. Header data flows from class attributes to external set_* functions. Signal data flows from data arrays into blockwrite and write functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of warnings for data truncation and sampling frequency imprecision is standard. No obfuscated code or code executing external commands or network activity. Functions for setting header fields perform standard validation. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured implementation of a biosignal file writer, with proper validation, header management, and data writing methods. It relies on external, presumably safe, library functions for actual file I/O. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system damage mechanisms is present. The code is primarily for file handling and data validation, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for writing EDF/BDF biosignal files. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It properly validates input, manages headers, and interfaces with external library functions. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
