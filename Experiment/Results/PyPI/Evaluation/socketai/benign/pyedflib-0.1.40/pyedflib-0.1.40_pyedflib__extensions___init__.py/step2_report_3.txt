  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** General, possibly data processing or network communication.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially network/file/system operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static analysis suggests benign code; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low malware and risk scores are justified given the static evidence. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing or system interaction, unclear.\n- **Potential Risks:** eval(), subprocess, network calls—possible security issues if untrusted data is used.\n- **Anomalies:** Presence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets noted as potential concerns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No explicit malicious activity, but patterns like eval() or subprocess calls with untrusted data could pose risks if present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.75, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report acknowledges potential risks but finds no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems reasonable unless such functions are confirmed present. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate if no malicious code is confirmed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing, external inputs.\n- **Potential Risks:** Network, files, subprocess—possible if used unsafely.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; analysis limited due to lack of code.\n- **Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns; low confidence due to limited info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.3.\n\n**Assessment:** The low confidence and lack of code justify the low scores. The reasoning is cautious and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** No code provided.\n- **Analysis:** Insufficient information.\n- **Conclusion:** Cannot assess, scores all zero.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data input/output, standard processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code appears straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the evidence. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are consistent with no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, matching the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly low (0.2), justified by the potential for risky functions if present, but no concrete evidence.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- For **Report 2**, if eval() or subprocess calls are confirmed in the actual code, raising the malware score above 0.1 could be justified. But based on the report, since no direct evidence is provided, keeping it at 0 is reasonable.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are conservative; unless specific risky functions or secrets are confirmed, they remain appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** (no malicious code confirmed in any report)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.2** (low, based on potential but unconfirmed issues)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' reasoning and the static analysis evidence.",
