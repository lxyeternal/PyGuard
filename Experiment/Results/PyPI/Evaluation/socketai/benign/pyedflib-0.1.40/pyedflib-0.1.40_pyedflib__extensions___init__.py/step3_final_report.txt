  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network calls, file operations, subprocesses, eval() or similar dynamic code execution functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, subprocess calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env/network) to sinks via function calls, data processing, or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval(), subprocess with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, obfuscation patterns, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. No evidence of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The absence of eval() or subprocess calls with untrusted data, along with no obfuscated code, supports a benign assessment. Limited or no code provided in some reports results in low confidence, but no anomalies are detected. The static analysis aligns with low malware and security risk scores. Potential concerns about dynamic code execution are acknowledged but not confirmed. Overall, the code is consistent with benign behavior, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified, and malware likelihood is negligible. The assessments across reports are consistent and appropriate given the available information.",
