{
  "purpose": "The code provides a test generator function to read a sample EDF file using the pyedflib library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local file 'test_generator.edf' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code that process untrusted data or perform any insecure actions.",
  "flows": "The function get_generator_filename() supplies the filename path to pyedflib.EdfReader(), which then reads the file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard file handling and library usage without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and pyedflib libraries. It defines a function test_generator() that retrieves the filename via get_generator_filename(), which constructs the path to 'test_generator.edf' in the same directory. Then, it creates an EdfReader object from that filename. The code is straightforward, with no user input, environment variables, or network activity. It simply accesses a local file and returns an object. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for reading a sample EDF file. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware traits.",
