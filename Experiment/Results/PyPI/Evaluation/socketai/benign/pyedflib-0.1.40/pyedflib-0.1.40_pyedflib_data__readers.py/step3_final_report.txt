{
  "purpose": "Load a local EDF file for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The function get_generator_filename() constructs a filename based on the script's directory; the filename is fixed as 'test_generator.edf'.",
  "sinks": "The code opens the EDF file using pyedflib.EdfReader; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The filename is generated from the script's directory, then passed directly to pyedflib.EdfReader to open the file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with static filename and no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, constructs a fixed filename based on the script's location, and opens the EDF file with pyedflib. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or execute external commands. The filename is static and local, and the code serves as a simple utility for testing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for loading a local EDF file. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The current scores accurately reflect its safety.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
