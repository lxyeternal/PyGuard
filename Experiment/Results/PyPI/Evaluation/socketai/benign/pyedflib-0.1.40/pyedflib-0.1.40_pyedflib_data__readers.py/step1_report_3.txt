{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility to load and return an EDF (European Data Format) file using the pyedflib library for further processing or testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filename from the local filesystem based on the script's directory using os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leaks are present; the code only loads a file and returns an object.",
  "flows": "The filename is generated from the local filesystem path, then passed directly to pyedflib.EdfReader, which loads the EDF file.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors present. The use of __file__ is standard for locating local resources.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a third-party library (pyedflib). The get_generator_filename function constructs a path to a specific EDF file in the script directory. test_generator calls this function, then uses pyedflib to open the file and returns the file handle object. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data being transmitted externally, and no malicious code present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for testing or loading EDF files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for reading a specific EDF file from the local filesystem. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.",
