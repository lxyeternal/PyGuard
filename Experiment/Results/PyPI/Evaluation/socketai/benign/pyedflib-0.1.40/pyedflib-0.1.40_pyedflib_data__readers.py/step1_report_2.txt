{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load a sample EDF (European Data Format) file using the pyedflib library for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The filename is obtained via get_generator_filename(), which constructs a path based on the current script's directory; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leaks are present; no data is sent over network or written to insecure locations.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a filename from a fixed location and loads the EDF file using pyedflib.EdfReader; no user input flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code relies on standard library functions and a third-party library without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function to retrieve a fixed EDF filename relative to the script's directory, and another function to load that file using pyedflib. The code appears to serve a testing purpose. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network communications, no code execution based on external input, and no signs of malicious behavior. It performs straightforward file handling and object instantiation without any anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign testing utility that loads a local EDF file. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply loads a file for testing or demonstration, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
