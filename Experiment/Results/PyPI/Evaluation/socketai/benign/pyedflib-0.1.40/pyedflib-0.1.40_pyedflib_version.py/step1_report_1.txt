  "purpose": "Defines version information and revision details for the package build process.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables and a conditional check on 'release'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static version and revision strings and performs a simple conditional check to possibly override the version if not a release. No input/output, no external calls, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations are present. It is part of setup configuration and contains no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
