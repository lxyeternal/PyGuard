{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for the pyedflib package, including version strings, git revision, and release status.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables initialized with version details, and a conditional statement setting the version based on release status.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could leak data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; version information is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (beyond version info), or obfuscation present. The conditional setting of 'version' based on 'release' is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes version-related variables with static values, including the git revision hash. The conditional block updates the 'version' variable if not in a release state, which is a typical version management approach. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration for a Python package setup, with no malicious behavior or security risks present.",
