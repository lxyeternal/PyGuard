  "purpose": "Defines version information and git revision for the package, likely used for version tracking and release management.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and git revision, based on configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent, stored insecurely, or used in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment of static data; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version strings and a git revision identifier as static strings. It includes a conditional statement to adjust the version based on the 'release' flag. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The code appears to be auto-generated documentation or configuration data, typical in package setup files. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup-related code snippet used for versioning information, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
