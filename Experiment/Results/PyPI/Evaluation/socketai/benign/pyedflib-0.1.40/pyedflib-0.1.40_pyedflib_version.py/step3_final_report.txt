  "purpose": "Defines version information and revision control for the package, used during setup.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for version strings and revision hash.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; simple assignment and conditional logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static configuration snippet with version info and a conditional check on the 'release' flag. It contains no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and purpose of the code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The code's structure and content are typical for package setup scripts, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration snippet used for versioning. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
