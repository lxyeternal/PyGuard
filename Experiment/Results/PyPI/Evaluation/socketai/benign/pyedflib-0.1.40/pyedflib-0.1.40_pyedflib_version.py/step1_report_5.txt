  "purpose": "This code defines version information and configuration for the pyedflib package, specifically related to its build or release metadata.",
  "sources": "Variables set with static string values: short_version, version, full_version, git_revision, and release.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or output that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of variable assignments and a simple conditional.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static metadata strings to variables and performs a basic conditional check on the 'release' boolean. There are no input reading, data processing, or output operations that could be exploited. No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup/configuration snippet that contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package version information. The code appears benign.",
