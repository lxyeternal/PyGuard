  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a set of static variable assignments defining version info and a conditional to set the version based on a 'release' flag.\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The code appears to be part of a standard setup or configuration file, typical in Python packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly states the code is just static assignments and a conditional check.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the analysis is accurate.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing standard version declaration.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Again, straightforward static data with a conditional.\n- **Assessment:** No external inputs or dynamic behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard versioning info, no external data or suspicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward variable assignments.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or security concerns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a benign, static configuration snippet with no dynamic or external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are correct.\n- No changes needed.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Confirm the scores as they are, and note that the code poses no security risks.",
