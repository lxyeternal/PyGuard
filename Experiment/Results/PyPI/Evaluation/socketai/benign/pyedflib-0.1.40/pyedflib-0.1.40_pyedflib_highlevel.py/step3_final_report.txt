{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling EDF files, including reading, writing, anonymization, cropping, renaming channels, and changing polarity. It operates locally on files and data structures, with no network activity or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reading EDF signals via pyedflib functions such as getSignalLabels(), readSignal(), getHeader(), and getSignalHeaders().",
  "sinks": "Writing EDF files using pyedflib.EdfWriter with provided headers and signals.",
  "flows": "Local data flow from reading EDF files, processing headers/signals, and writing modified EDF files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and optional tqdm import is safely handled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of standard EDF file management functions, operating solely on local files with clear, well-documented logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The functions include safe parameter handling, header management, and data processing typical for biomedical data workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific utility suite for EDF file handling with no indications of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. It operates entirely locally, with no network activity or hidden functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk in data handling but no malicious intent.",
