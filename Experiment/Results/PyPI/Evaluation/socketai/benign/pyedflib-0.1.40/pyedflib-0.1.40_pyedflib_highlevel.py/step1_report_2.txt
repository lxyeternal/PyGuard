{
  "purpose": "The code provides high-level functions to read, write, manipulate, anonymize, crop, and compare EDF files, mainly for EEG or biosignal data management using pyedflib.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from EDF files through pyedflib's readSignal, getHeader, getSignalLabels, getSignalHeaders, readAnnotations, and getStartdatetime methods.",
  "sinks": "Writes data and metadata back to EDF files via pyedflib's EdfWriter, including signals, headers, annotations, and metadata. Also reads annotations and signal labels for internal processing.",
  "flows": "Input data sources include reading signals, headers, annotations, and labels. Manipulated data (e.g., renaming, cropping, polarity inversion, anonymization) flows from in-memory variables to the write functions, which save back to files. Modifications are generally limited to header fields, signal data, and annotations, with no network transmission or external process invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The tqdm wrapper function safely handles optional dependency loading. No hard-coded credentials or backdoors are present. The functions for file handling perform standard read/write operations with safety checks. No obfuscated or misleading code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O operations on EDF files using pyedflib, with functions for creating headers, reading signals, writing signals, and manipulating headers and data. It includes utility functions such as anonymization and cropping, all of which operate locally on files without network activity or external command execution. The optional tqdm import is safely handled, and warnings are used appropriately. No signs of code injection, hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears well-structured for its intended purpose with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of safe, purpose-specific functions for EDF file manipulation, including reading, writing, cropping, renaming, polarity change, and anonymization. It operates solely on local files and data structures without external communications or suspicious behaviors. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected.",
