{
  "purpose": "The code provides high-level functions to work with EDF files, including reading, writing, anonymizing, cropping, renaming channels, and changing polarity. Its primary goal is to facilitate EEG/physiological data manipulation and management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from EDF files using pyedflib's EdfReader (functions like read_edf, compare_edf, drop_channels, anonymize_edf, crop_edf, rename_channels, change_polarity). It also reads channel labels, header info, and annotations from EDF files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing modified EDF files via pyedflib's EdfWriter (functions like write_edf, write_edf_quick), and the read and process of signals for operations like cropping, renaming, and polarity changes. There are no clear network connections, file uploads, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading EDF files (sources: read_edf, read_edf_header), through modifications such as channel renaming, anonymization, cropping, polarity change, and finally written back to disk (sinks: write_edf, write_edf_quick). These flows are managed locally and do not involve external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code anomalies, backdoors, or hidden functions detected. The tqdm function attempts dynamic import but defaults to pass-through, which is benign. All functions seem to operate strictly on local files. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The use of warnings and assertions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-documented functions for handling EDF files. It uses pyedflib to read/write data, modify headers, and perform data operations like cropping, channel renaming, and polarity inversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does include potentially sensitive operations like anonymization and data cropping, but these are aligned with legitimate data management tasks. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The functions handle data locally with appropriate safeguards, warnings, and assertions. Overall, the logic and implementation are consistent with a cybersecurity analyst’s review, showing no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data manipulation utilities for EDF files, intended for secure, local data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It functions within expected parameters for medical data handling, with standard practices for safety and integrity.",
