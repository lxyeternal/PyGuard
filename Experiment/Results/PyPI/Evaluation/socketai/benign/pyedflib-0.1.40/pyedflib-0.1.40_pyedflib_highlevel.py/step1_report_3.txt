{
  "purpose": "The code provides high-level functions for reading, writing, manipulating, and anonymizing EDF (electroencephalogram) files, mainly for data processing and management in biomedical contexts.",
  "sources": "Reads input files (EDF files) and user-supplied parameters, such as file paths, channel selections, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Writes EDF files, potentially overwriting existing files; loads signals into memory for processing; and in the tqdm function, attempts to import and use tqdm for progress indication.",
  "flows": "Loads EDF files into memory, modifies headers or signals (e.g., anonymization, renaming, cropping, polarity change), and then writes back to disk. User-supplied data flows into functions as parameters; signal data flows from reading functions to processing and writing functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code or unexpected dynamic code execution. The tqdm wrapper for optional progress bar usage is benign. The use of warnings and assertions is standard for validation. No network communication, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions perform standard file I/O and data processing tasks, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script offers comprehensive utilities for EDF file management, including reading, writing, anonymizing, cropping, renaming, and polarity alteration. It uses pyedflib for file operations and numpy for data manipulation. The code validates inputs, manages file safety (preventing overwrites unless specified), and provides warnings for potential issues such as mismatched signal ranges. The optional tqdm dependency is safely handled with a try-except block, and no parts of the code dynamically execute untrusted code or handle sensitive data in a malicious manner. All functions serve data processing purposes without performing any network operations, system modifications, or covert behaviors. There are no signs of embedded backdoors, data exfiltration, or malware. The code adheres to standard practices for data processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard data processing utility for EDF files with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected operations for biomedical data management, with safety checks and validations in place. The overall security risk is minimal.",
