  "purpose": "Locate documentation source files (.rst) relative to the script and run embedded doctests on them.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), glob.glob for .rst files in documentation directories",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external communication",
  "flows": "Filesystem path construction -> glob.glob to gather files -> doctest.DocFileSuite to run tests",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard library usage, no obfuscation, no malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to documentation files, gathers all .rst files in specified directories, creates a doctest suite from these files, and runs the suite using unittest. It uses standard modules and patterns, with no network activity, no user input, no secrets, and no suspicious constructs. The purpose is to verify documentation correctness. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The only minor concern is filesystem access, which is typical for such scripts and does not pose a real security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard documentation testing utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is an overestimation; the overall risk is effectively zero.",
