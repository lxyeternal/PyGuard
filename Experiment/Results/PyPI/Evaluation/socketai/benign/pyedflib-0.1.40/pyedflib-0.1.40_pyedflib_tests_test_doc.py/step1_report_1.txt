  "purpose": "This script runs doctest-based tests on reStructuredText documentation files in a specific directory.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.join, glob.glob, __file__, and the files matched by glob in the docs directory",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks are present; the code primarily reads files and runs tests",
  "flows": "Files are located via glob and passed to doctest.DocFileSuite for testing; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed; code structure is standard for test setup",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to documentation source files and runs doctests on them. It uses standard modules (os, glob, unittest, doctest). There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The script is solely for testing documentation files, with no network activity, code injection, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard testing utility for documentation files and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
