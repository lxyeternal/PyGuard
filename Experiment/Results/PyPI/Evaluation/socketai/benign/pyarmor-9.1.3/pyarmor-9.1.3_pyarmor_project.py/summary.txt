  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured configuration management module for pyarmor projects. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to filesystem operations, which are standard in such contexts. All signals and reports are consistent with this assessment."
