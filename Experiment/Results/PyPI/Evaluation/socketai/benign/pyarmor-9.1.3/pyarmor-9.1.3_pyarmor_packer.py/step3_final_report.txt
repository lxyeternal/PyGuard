{
  "purpose": "This script automates the obfuscation and packaging of Python scripts using external tools like PyArmor and PyInstaller, facilitating distribution without exposing source code.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, configuration files, filesystem operations, user inputs for command execution.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing external commands, file operations such as move, copy, delete, and patching spec files.",
  "flows": "User inputs influence command construction and file manipulations; external commands are run based on these inputs, affecting build artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated malicious code segments detected; operations are typical for build automation.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a build utility for obfuscating and packaging Python scripts, executing external tools with user-supplied parameters. It performs file operations and patches spec files in a standard manner. No signs of malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or covert backdoors, are present. The subprocess executions are based on user inputs but are typical for such tools. No obfuscation or malicious code is embedded within the script itself. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build automation utility for Python scripts, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. Its operations are standard for packaging and obfuscation workflows, and the potential risks are typical for such tools when misused. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
