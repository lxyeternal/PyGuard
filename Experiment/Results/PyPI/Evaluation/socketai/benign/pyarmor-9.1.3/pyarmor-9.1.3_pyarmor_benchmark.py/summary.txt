  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate benchmarking and obfuscation automation tool for pyarmor. It does not exhibit malicious activity. The potential security concern lies in its use of subprocess and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if inputs are compromised, but no such activity is evident here. The assigned scores are appropriate."
