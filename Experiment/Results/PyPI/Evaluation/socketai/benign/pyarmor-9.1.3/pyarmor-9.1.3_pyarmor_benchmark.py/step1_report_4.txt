{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to generate, obfuscate, and benchmark Python scripts using the pyarmor tool, including performance measurements and module import testing.",
  "sources": "Reads include file operations (reading/writing scripts), command-line arguments, environment variables (like __file__), and subprocess calls to external tools.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to external processes, file writes, module imports, and dynamic execution via subprocess and import functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (command-line args, environment variables, files) flow into subprocess commands and import functions; obfuscation settings influence script generation and execution; performance functions measure code execution time.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes dynamic module importing, obfuscation automation via pyarmor, and flexible command-line parameters. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily automates testing and obfuscation of Python scripts using the pyarmor tool. It dynamically generates test scripts, obfuscates them, copies files, and runs performance measurements. Subprocess calls invoke pyarmor commands with user-provided parameters, but these are intended for legitimate obfuscation tasks. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or unauthorized system access are detected. All external interactions appear related to legitimate benchmarking and obfuscation processes. The code does include dynamic import and subprocess usage, but these are part of the testing workflow. No signs of hidden backdoors, malicious payloads, or privacy leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate benchmarking and obfuscation automation tool utilizing pyarmor. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors, but it performs dynamic code generation, obfuscation, and execution, which should be used with trusted inputs and environments. Overall, the code appears safe and aligned with its intended purpose.",
