  "conclusion": "The code is a protected encrypted module loader, not inherently malicious. Its main security concern is potential misuse to load malicious encrypted modules, especially given environment variable dependence and dynamic loading. The malware score is low (~0.2), obfuscation is moderate (~0.5), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.4). Proper validation and environment control are recommended to mitigate risks."
