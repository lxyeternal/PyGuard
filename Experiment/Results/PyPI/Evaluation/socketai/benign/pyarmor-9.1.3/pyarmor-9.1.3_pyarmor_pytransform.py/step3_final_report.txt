{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a wrapper around native libraries (_pytransform) to facilitate licensing, code encryption, hardware info retrieval, and platform-specific operations for protection and licensing schemes.",
  "sources": "Reads system info, platform details, and user inputs; interacts with native DLL functions for version info, encryption, license generation, and hardware data.",
  "sinks": "Calls to native functions that process licensing data, hardware info, and cryptographic operations; potential data leakage if libraries are compromised.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info, license data) flows into native DLL functions via function calls; results are returned and processed in Python.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and primarily acts as a wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protection wrapper that loads platform-specific native libraries and exposes functions for versioning, encryption, licensing, and hardware info. It relies heavily on external native libraries (_pytransform), which could be malicious if compromised, but the Python code itself is benign. No suspicious or malicious logic, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The risk stems from external dependencies, not the code itself. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.4) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate component of a licensing and protection system, with no inherent malicious behavior. The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity of the external native libraries it loads. The code itself is clear, non-obfuscated, and free of malicious logic.",
