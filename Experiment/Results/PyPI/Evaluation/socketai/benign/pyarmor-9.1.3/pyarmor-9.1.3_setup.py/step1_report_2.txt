{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pyarmor' Python project, including specifying dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the project version from 'pyarmor.config', reads the README.rst file for long description, processes command line arguments, and loads data files and platform-specific libraries.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted data; no network operations, command execution, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and long description from files; modifies 'platform_data_files' list based on command-line arguments; prepares package data and dependencies for setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code manipulates 'platform_data_files' list dynamically based on command-line options, which is standard for packaging scripts. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious commands detected. The import from 'pyarmor.config' assumes local module structure but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup for distribution, reading configuration and resource files, adjusting platform-specific filenames when building wheels. No untrusted input is used to execute commands, no data leaks or network activity are present. The dynamic adjustment of 'platform_data_files' based on command-line arguments is typical in build scripts, not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'pyarmor' tool. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only manages package metadata, data files, and dependencies, with no indication of sabotage or security issues.",
