  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It's a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project (`pyarmor`).\n- Reads version info from `pyarmor.config`.\n- Reads long description from `README.rst`.\n- Adjusts platform-specific data files based on command-line arguments.\n- Defines package data, dependencies, and entry points.\n- Uses common modules (`setuptools`, `distutils`, `codecs`, `os`, `sys`).\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup configuration.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The high confidence (0.95) is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard packaging.\n- **Analysis:** No untrusted data or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The dynamic platform data file adjustment is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The confidence (1.0) is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no network or code injection.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct. Confidence 1.0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup script.\n- **Analysis:** Notes that manipulating `platform_data_files` based on command-line args could be exploited, but is normal in build scripts.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score due to the potential for misuse if command-line args are manipulated maliciously. However, in a controlled build environment, this is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected; the risk score of 0.2 is reasonable but should not be considered high.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected in any report. The code is a typical setup script.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** The highest is 0.2, which is reasonable given the dynamic modification of data files based on command-line arguments, but this is standard practice in build scripts.\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low; the only potential concern is manipulation of build parameters, which is common and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The code does **not** execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or contain hidden behaviors.\n- The dynamic adjustment of data files based on command-line args is typical for multi-platform packaging and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a benign setup script with negligible security concerns.",
