{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyarmor package, managing installation, metadata, and data files.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from 'pyarmor.config', reads README.rst for long description, reads command-line arguments (argv) for build customization.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no direct data leakage, system commands, or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README for metadata; processes command-line arguments to adjust platform data files; passes data to setuptools setup() for installation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'argv' to modify data files dynamically based on build options, which is standard for build scripts; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution; no external network calls or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations: importing modules, reading files for descriptions, configuring data files, and invoking setuptools. It includes platform-specific data file adjustments based on command-line arguments, which is common for multi-platform package builds. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file for the pyarmor package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It handles standard setup tasks with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
