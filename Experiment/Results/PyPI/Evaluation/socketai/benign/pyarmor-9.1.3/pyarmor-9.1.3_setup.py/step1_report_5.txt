{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the pyarmor project, including configuration of files, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from pyarmor.config, reads README.rst for long description, reads command-line arguments (argv), and accesses filesystem for files listed in data files.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no execution of untrusted code or network activities are found.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments influence data file handling for platform-specific files, but no untrusted data flows to execution or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The script dynamically modifies data file lists based on command-line options; however, this is typical in packaging scripts. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are identified. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools for package configuration. It reads version info and long description from files, configures package data, dependencies, and entry points. The conditional handling for 'bdist_wheel' adjusts data files based on platform, which is a common pattern. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors are detected. The use of external configuration and data files appears legitimate and aligned with typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a legitimate setup script for the pyarmor project with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows standard Python packaging conventions without evidence of sabotage or malware.",
