  "purpose": "Standard Python setup configuration script for packaging the 'pyarmor' project, including reading version info, long description, and platform-specific data files, with dynamic adjustments based on build arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'pyarmor.config', long description from 'README.rst', command-line arguments ('argv'), and package data files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, code execution, or external communication detected.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments influence 'platform_data_files' modifications; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional modification of 'platform_data_files' based on command-line arguments, which is typical in build scripts but could be exploited if manipulated maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging, with no obfuscated or malicious code. The dynamic adjustment of data files based on command-line arguments is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or network activity are present. The slight risk score (0.2) reflects potential misuse if build parameters are manipulated, but this is inherent to build scripts and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The minor risk associated with command-line argument handling is typical for build processes and does not constitute a security threat.",
