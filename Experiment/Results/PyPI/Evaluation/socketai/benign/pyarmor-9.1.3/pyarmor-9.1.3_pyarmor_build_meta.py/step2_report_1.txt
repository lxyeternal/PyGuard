  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code automates wheel building with obfuscation, unpacks, modifies, and repacks. It dynamically invokes obfuscation on `__init__.py`, manipulates RECORD files, and uses internal pip configuration.\n\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity. It mainly automates legitimate obfuscation for package protection. Potential misuse exists if malicious obfuscation options are supplied or if the process is compromised.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.4 (moderate due to dynamic manipulation and potential for misuse)\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe scores seem reasonable. The risk score is slightly elevated but justified given the dynamic and manipulative nature of the process.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on package build and obfuscation. No network activity or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation could be misused but appears legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.2 (some obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious)  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (low, standard build process)\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent. The malware score remains at zero, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script wraps setuptools and pyarmor, unpacks, obfuscates, and repacks. Uses external tools legitimately, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.2  \n  - Malware: 0.0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:**  \nAppropriate. No signs of malware, and the obfuscation is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar process—building, obfuscating, repacking. Uses legitimate tools, no network activity or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code builds and obfuscates wheels with pyarmor, no malicious activity, no network, no backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's purpose as a build and obfuscation tool. No signs of malware, exfiltration, or malicious code execution.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.2), reflecting the use of obfuscation but not necessarily malicious obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, justified by the potential misuse of obfuscation to hide malicious code, especially given the dynamic and manipulative aspects of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated:** **0.2** — Obfuscation is present but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Security Risk:** **0.3** — Moderate risk due to the potential for misuse, dynamic file manipulation, and obfuscation, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate build tool for Python packages with obfuscation capabilities. While obfuscation can be exploited maliciously, the current evidence and analysis suggest it is used for legitimate purposes, with a moderate security concern if misused.",
