  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and obfuscation utility designed to protect Python packages. While obfuscation can be exploited to conceal malicious payloads, there is no evidence within this code of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The dynamic manipulation and external tool invocation are typical for such build processes. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential misuse, but the script itself is benign."
