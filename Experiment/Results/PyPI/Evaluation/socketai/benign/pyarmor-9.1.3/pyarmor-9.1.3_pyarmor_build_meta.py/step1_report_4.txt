{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom build process for Python wheels incorporating obfuscation via pyarmor, including unpacking, obfuscating, and repacking wheel files.",
  "sources": "Reads wheel files (.whl), package directories, environment variables (sys.version_info), and configuration data via pip internal configuration.",
  "sinks": "Executes pyarmor_main (which runs obfuscation), writes to wheel RECORD files, and creates/overwrites files during wheel build and obfuscation process.",
  "flows": "Wheel file is unpacked -> Files are obfuscated using pyarmor -> Runtime files appended to wheel record -> Wheel is repacked and replaced.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal pip configuration and dynamic manipulation of build options; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. pyarmor is a legitimate obfuscation tool but can be used maliciously if misused. No obfuscated or suspicious code is directly present; reliance on external obfuscation tool (pyarmor).",
  "analysis": "The script performs a custom wheel build process: it unpacks an existing wheel, applies obfuscation via pyarmor to specific files, appends runtime files to the wheel, and repacks it. It interacts with package build systems and modifies the wheel contents. The use of pyarmor for obfuscation is typical, but if misused, could hide malicious intent. No direct network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modification is present. The code appears to be a build pipeline, not malware. It does utilize configuration and external tools in a way that could be exploited to hide malicious payloads if combined with malicious obfuscated code, but nothing suspicious is detected within this code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a custom wheel builder with obfuscation capabilities, using legitimate tools and methods. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior itself, though obfuscation can be used maliciously. Overall, it appears to be a standard build script with no active malicious actions.",
