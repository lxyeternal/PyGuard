{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the Python module search path by inserting the absolute path of the current script's directory at the beginning of sys.path.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script's directory via __file__ and using abspath and dirname to determine its absolute path.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.path, which influences module import behavior.",
  "flows": "Retrieving __file__ → calculating absolute path → inserting into sys.path; no further data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code simply alters sys.path with the current script's directory, which is a common practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and os.path functions, then prepends the current script's directory to sys.path, likely to influence module import resolution. This is a typical pattern used in Python packaging or script setup. No external data inputs, no network operations, and no suspicious code logic are present. The code appears to be benign and intended for standard module import management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script to modify module search paths and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical in Python package or script initialization.",
