{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the Python module search path to include the directory of the current script, likely to enable importing local modules or packages.",
  "sources": "The script reads the current script's file path via '__file__', then computes its absolute path and directory, which are used to modify 'sys.path'.",
  "sinks": "Modifying 'sys.path' can influence module resolution but does not directly lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source '__file__' is used to determine the directory path, which then flows into 'sys.path.insert' to modify module search paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs a common setup task.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules ('sys' and 'os.path'), then inserts the directory of the current script into 'sys.path' at position 0. This allows for local module imports to take precedence. No data input from external sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The comment '# Package pyarmor' suggests it is part of a packaging or obfuscation process, but the code itself remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup snippet to include the script's directory in the module search path. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
