  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to include the script's directory for module import resolution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ variable to determine the current script's location.",
  "sinks": "sys.path insertion affects module import behavior but does not directly lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Source (__file__) -> abspath(dirname(__file__)) -> sys.path.insert(0, ...)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, uses __file__ to determine the script's directory, converts it to an absolute path, and inserts it at the start of sys.path. This is a common pattern in Python packaging. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or code injection. All signals indicate benign, standard setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security or malicious threat. The reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
