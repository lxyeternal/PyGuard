  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for augmenting, suppressing, and managing pylint checkers and messages, enabling customization of pylint's behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads from linter object, message store, and function parameters; accesses checker classes and message definitions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to linter.add_message(), suppression methods that modify message flow, and message suppression logic within context managers.",
  "flows": "Dynamic import and attribute access lead to method wrapping; suppression functions modify linter message handling during context execution.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected; uses standard reflection and dynamic attribute access typical for plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The code provides legitimate utility functions for extending pylint, including message suppression and augmentation. It employs dynamic method replacement, reflection, and version compatibility handling. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. Suppression features could be misused to hide warnings, but this is a known feature, not an attack. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common plugin patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate utility for pylint customization with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Its suppression capabilities could be misused but are standard for such tools. Overall, it poses a low security risk and is suitable for use.",
