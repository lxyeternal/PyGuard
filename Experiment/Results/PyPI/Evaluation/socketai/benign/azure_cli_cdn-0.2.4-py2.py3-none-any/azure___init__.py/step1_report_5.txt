  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package, enabling it to be part of a namespace package structure.",
  "sources": "The module reads its own name (__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pkg_resources.declare_namespace' is a standard pattern for namespace packages; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package using 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. This is a standard technique in Python packaging to support namespace packages across multiple distributions. There are no inputs, no external data handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal, clean, and straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern used in namespace package setup, with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
