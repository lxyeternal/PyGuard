  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, likely as part of a larger package structure.",
  "sources": "The import of pkg_resources and the call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares a namespace without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace for the package, which is a standard practice in Python package development to allow multiple packages to share a namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no dynamic execution or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare a namespace for package organization. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
