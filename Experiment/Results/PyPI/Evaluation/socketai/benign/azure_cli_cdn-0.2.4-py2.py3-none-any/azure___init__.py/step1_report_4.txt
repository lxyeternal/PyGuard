{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, likely as part of a larger modular package structure.",
  "sources": "The call to pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__) which reads the module name.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of namespace declaration, which is common in namespace packages but can be suspicious if combined with other malicious code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__). This is standard practice for namespace packages to split a package across multiple distributions. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident. The code is minimal, limited to namespace declaration, and does not perform any data handling, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration without any signs of malicious intent. It is typical in Python namespace packages and poses no security risk.",
