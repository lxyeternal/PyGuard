  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package to facilitate namespace packaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) during the namespace declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "The namespace declaration uses __name__ as input but does not process external untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no unusual constructs or hidden behavior. It does not perform any network, file, or sensitive data operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares the current module as a namespace package using declare_namespace. This is a standard practice in Python packaging to support modular distribution. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The minimal nature of the code limits the potential for malicious behavior. The only data read is __name__, a built-in variable, which is safe. No external inputs or outputs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
