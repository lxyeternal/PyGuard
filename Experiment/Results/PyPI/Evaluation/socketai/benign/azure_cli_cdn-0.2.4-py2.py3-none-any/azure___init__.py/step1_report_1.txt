  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package, enabling modular organization of the code.",
  "sources": "The import of 'pkg_resources' to handle namespace declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only namespace declaration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace with '__name__'. This is a standard practice for Python packages that use namespace packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. No input/output operations, no data handling, and no dynamic code execution are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern in Python packaging, and the code appears benign.",
