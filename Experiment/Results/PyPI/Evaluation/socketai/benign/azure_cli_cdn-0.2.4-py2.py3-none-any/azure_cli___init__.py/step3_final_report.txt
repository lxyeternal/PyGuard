  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__). It is a common pattern for namespace packages, with no data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
