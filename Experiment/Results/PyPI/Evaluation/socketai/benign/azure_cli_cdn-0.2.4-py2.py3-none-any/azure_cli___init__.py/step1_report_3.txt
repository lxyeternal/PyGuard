  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package to support modular or plugin-based architecture.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and declaration of namespace with __name__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace is a typical pattern for namespace packages, not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace, which is a common practice in Python packaging for creating namespace packages. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns are evident. There are no input/output operations, no external network connections, and no code obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
