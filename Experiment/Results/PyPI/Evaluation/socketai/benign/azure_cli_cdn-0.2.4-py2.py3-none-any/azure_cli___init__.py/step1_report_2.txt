  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources and calling declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; namespace declaration is static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of declare_namespace is an uncommon pattern in modern code but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a standard pattern for creating namespace packages in Python, enabling multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not handle data, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. It is minimal and adheres to standard practices for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or potentially harmful operations.",
