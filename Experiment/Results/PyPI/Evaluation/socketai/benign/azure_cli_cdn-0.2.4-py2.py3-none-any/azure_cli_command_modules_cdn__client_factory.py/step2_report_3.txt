  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided code consists of several simple factory functions that import Azure SDK modules and create management clients for Azure CDN resources, based on a provided CLI context (`cli_ctx`). The functions are straightforward, returning SDK client objects without processing untrusted data or executing any logic beyond client instantiation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and aligns with standard Azure SDK patterns.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or hidden code.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Data flow/security risks:** No untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause security issues.\n- **Credentials/secrets:** No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** The code is boilerplate for SDK client creation, with no anomalies.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical Azure CLI extension pattern for creating management clients, with no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:  \n- The code does not process untrusted data, does not execute network operations, and does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious logic.  \n- The functions are simple SDK client factories, which are common in SDK or CLI extension code.\n\n**Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is standard SDK boilerplate.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The overall security posture of this code is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.**  \nThe code is safe, and no further action is needed.",
