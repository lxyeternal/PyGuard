{
  "purpose": "Provide factory functions to access various Azure CDN management services via the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function parameters, particularly 'cli_ctx' for context.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted 'cli_ctx' input passed to 'get_mgmt_service_client' and subsequent API calls.",
  "flows": "Input 'cli_ctx' flows through 'get_mgmt_service_client' to various CDN service calls like 'custom_domains', 'endpoints', etc.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Usage of standard Azure SDK client factory pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions that act as wrappers to retrieve specific CDN management client interfaces from the Azure SDK using the provided CLI context. These functions are simple, straightforward, and utilize standard SDK methods. There are no suspicious data flows, no dynamic code execution, nor any signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The input 'cli_ctx' is a typical parameter for Azure CLI extensions, used to create service clients. No anomalies or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Azure CLI extension code for managing CDN resources. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides accessors for Azure CDN management clients using the provided context.",
