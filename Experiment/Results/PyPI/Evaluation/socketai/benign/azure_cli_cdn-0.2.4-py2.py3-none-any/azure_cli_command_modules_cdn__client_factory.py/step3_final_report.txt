{
  "purpose": "The code provides factory functions to instantiate Azure CDN management clients using the Azure SDK, facilitating resource management operations within CLI extensions.",
  "sources": "The functions read the 'cli_ctx' parameter, which supplies the Azure CLI context necessary for SDK client creation.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only creates and returns SDK client objects without processing external input or executing data flows.",
  "flows": "The source ('cli_ctx') is passed into SDK client factory functions, which instantiate and return specific management clients; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward SDK client factory boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, standard factory functions importing SDK modules and returning management client instances based on the provided CLI context. There is no data validation, user input processing, or network activity. The functions are typical for Azure CLI extensions and do not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is solely resource client instantiation, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK client factory functions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as assigned.",
