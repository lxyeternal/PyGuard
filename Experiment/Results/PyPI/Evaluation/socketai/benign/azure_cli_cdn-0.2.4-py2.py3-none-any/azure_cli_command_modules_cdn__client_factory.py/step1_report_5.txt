  "purpose": "Provides factory functions to create and access various Azure CDN management client components.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.commands and azure.mgmt.cdn modules; function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions merely instantiate and return client objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard SDK client factory pattern without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Azure SDK modules, defines simple factory functions to instantiate CDN management client components, and returns specific service clients. No untrusted data inputs, no data processing, and no network communication or data leakage are present. The functions serve as wrappers for SDK client creation, with no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration points. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK client factory setup used for interacting with Azure CDN services. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It is a typical, safe code snippet for Azure SDK usage.",
