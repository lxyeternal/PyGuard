  "purpose": "Provides factory functions to create clients for managing Azure CDN resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.commands.client_factory and azure.mgmt.cdn modules; function parameters.",
  "targets": "Returns client objects for CDN management without processing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> create client objects -> return clients; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple factory functions to instantiate Azure CDN management clients. It imports modules directly, uses provided CLI context to create clients, and returns these clients. There is no input validation, no data processing, and no handling of untrusted data. The functions are straightforward and serve as wrappers around existing SDK calls. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously intended code observed. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Azure CLI extension development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical factory setup for Azure CDN clients with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely facilitates access to Azure CDN management resources.",
