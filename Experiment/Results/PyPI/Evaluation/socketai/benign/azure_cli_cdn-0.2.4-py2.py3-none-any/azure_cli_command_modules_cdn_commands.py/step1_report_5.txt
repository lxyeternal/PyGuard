{
  "purpose": "This code defines command groups and commands for Azure CDN management using the Azure CLI, enabling operations like create, update, delete, show, and list for CDN profiles, endpoints, custom domains, origins, and edge nodes.",
  "sources": "The code sources are mostly from imported modules, particularly from azure.mgmt.cdn and azure.cli.core.commands, and from internal functions such as cf_cdn, cf_endpoints, etc., which are factory functions for creating clients.",
  "sinks": "The sinks include the execution of client methods for Azure CDN management, such as 'get', 'list', 'create', 'update', 'delete', 'load_content', 'purge_content', 'validate_custom_domain', 'enable_custom_https', and 'disable_custom_https'. These execute cloud management commands, but do not handle untrusted user input directly within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data. The command definitions are static, and any user input is handled within Azure CLI's command execution context, not within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be standard command registration code for Azure CLI extensions, with proper exception handling for resource not found scenarios.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines exception handling for 404 errors, and registers multiple command groups related to Azure CDN management. Each command is linked to a client method, with no apparent manipulation of input data. The commands include create, update, delete, show, list, and specific actions like 'load', 'purge', 'enable-https', etc. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input within this code, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The structure and content match typical Azure CLI extension patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for Azure CDN management commands within the Azure CLI, with proper exception handling and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It does not process untrusted input directly and appears safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
