  "purpose": "The code defines CLI command groups and commands for managing Azure CDN resources, including profiles, endpoints, custom domains, origins, edge nodes, and usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.commands, local module '_client_factory', and exception handling within nested functions.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of Azure SDK methods for resource management, error handling with raising exceptions, and CLI command execution.",
  "flows": "User or system input triggers command functions; commands invoke SDK client methods; exceptions handled or propagated; commands potentially modify or retrieve data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Exception handling logic is standard, with no obfuscated code or unusual constructs. No network or data exfiltration code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up command groups and commands for Azure CDN resource management using standard Azure SDK practices. Exception handling functions check for 404 errors and raise CLI errors accordingly. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident, and no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward, adhering to common patterns for Azure CLI extension modules.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation of CLI commands for Azure CDN resource management. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malware.",
