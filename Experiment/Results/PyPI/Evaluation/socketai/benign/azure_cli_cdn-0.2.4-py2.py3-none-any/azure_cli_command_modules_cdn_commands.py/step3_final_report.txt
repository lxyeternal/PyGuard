  "purpose": "This code registers CLI commands for managing Azure CDN resources, utilizing SDK modules and factory functions to define command groups and operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SDK modules and local factory functions, as well as command definitions that invoke SDK methods.",
  "sinks": "SDK method calls for resource operations; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Command invocations flow from CLI commands to SDK methods; exception handlers manage errors, particularly 404 not found responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI extension setup for Azure CDN management, with standard command registration, exception handling, and SDK usage. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Security scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The exception handlers are typical for resource not found errors, and no untrusted input processing or network activity outside SDK calls is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI command registration module for Azure CDN resources. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent and appropriate.",
