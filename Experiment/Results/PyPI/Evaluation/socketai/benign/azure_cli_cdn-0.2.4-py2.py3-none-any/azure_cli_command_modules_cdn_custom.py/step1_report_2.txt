{
  "purpose": "This code provides management functions for Azure CDN profiles, endpoints, and custom domains, facilitating resource creation, updating, and listing through Azure SDKs.",
  "sources": "User inputs via function parameters (e.g., resource group names, profile names, endpoint configurations, custom domain info). The SDK methods may internally read from Azure services.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include SDK calls that modify or create resources on Azure. No explicit data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system commands are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., resource parameters) flow into SDK call functions for creating or updating Azure resources. No untrusted external data flows into dangerous system functions or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard SDK functions and data structures, with no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard management layer for Azure CDN resources, utilizing SDK classes and functions. It includes functions to list, create, and update CDN profiles, endpoints, and custom domains. No input validation issues are apparent; parameters are passed directly to SDK methods. There are no obfuscated code patterns, code injections, or malicious control flows. No external or network communications are performed directly by this code, aside from the SDK calls to Azure services. The code is straightforward, structured, and adheres to typical SDK usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical, benign Azure management utility for CDN resources with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely interacts with Azure SDKs to manage CDN resources, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
