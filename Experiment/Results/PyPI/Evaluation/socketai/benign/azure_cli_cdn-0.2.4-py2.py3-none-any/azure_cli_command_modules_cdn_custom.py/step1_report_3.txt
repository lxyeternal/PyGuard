{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for managing Azure CDN profiles and endpoints, including creation, updating, and listing resources, primarily through Azure SDK calls.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as resource_group_name, profile_name, endpoint_name, and data passed to SDK methods like create and update operations.",
  "sinks": "The code calls Azure SDK methods which interact with Azure services; potential data leaks could occur if sensitive data (like credentials or secrets) were embedded or passed insecurely, but none are present here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs to SDK calls for resource creation and updates. No external or untrusted data sources (like user input or network data) are directly processed in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed. Usage of SDK methods is standard. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious actions identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for managing Azure CDN resources, such as listing profiles, updating endpoints, creating endpoints, custom domains, and profiles. It uses standard Azure SDK patterns with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, or unusual code constructs. The code appears to be a typical management script for Azure CDN resources, with proper separation of concerns and no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Azure management utility module for CDN resources, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted input in a manner that could lead to injection or data leaks, and there are no backdoors or malicious code patterns.",
