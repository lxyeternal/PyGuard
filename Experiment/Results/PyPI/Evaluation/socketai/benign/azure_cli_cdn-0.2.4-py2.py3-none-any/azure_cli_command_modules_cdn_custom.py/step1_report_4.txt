  "purpose": "This code provides functions to manage Azure CDN profiles and endpoints, including creation, updating, and listing.",
  "sources": "User inputs for resource group name, profile name, endpoint details, and custom domain details.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Azure SDK methods that create or update resources. No direct data leaks or unsafe operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK method calls such as 'client.profiles.create' and 'client.endpoints.create'. No dangerous data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code is primarily calling Azure SDK functions with user-supplied data. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Azure CDN management operations. It defines functions to list profiles, update endpoints, create endpoints, and create custom domains using Azure SDK. There are default values for some parameters and a helper function for property updates. No malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or malware patterns are evident. All data flows involve legitimate SDK calls with user-provided input. No signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Azure management utility for CDN resources, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration. Overall, it is a benign and typical SDK wrapper implementation.",
