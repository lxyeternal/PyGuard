{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing Azure CDN profiles and endpoints, including creation, updating, and listing, primarily for use within Azure CLI extensions.",
  "sources": "User inputs or parameters for functions such as resource group names, profile names, endpoint configurations, and tags.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network requests, file writes, or execution of untrusted code; it mainly constructs and returns API request objects.",
  "flows": "Inputs (resource names, configuration parameters) are used to create or update Azure SDK model objects, which are then passed to SDK functions for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unusual variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions that create and update Azure CDN profile and endpoint models, and call SDK methods. It uses parameter defaults and simple attribute assignments. There are no network calls or file operations that could be malicious. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling found. The use of SDK functions and model creation is typical for Azure management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign set of utility functions for managing Azure CDN resources. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. No security risks are apparent beyond standard API usage, which is expected for this type of management script.",
