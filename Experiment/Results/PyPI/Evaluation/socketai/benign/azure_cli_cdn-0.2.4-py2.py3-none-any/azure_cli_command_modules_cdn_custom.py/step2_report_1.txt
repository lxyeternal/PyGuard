  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for managing Azure CDN resources via SDK calls.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious control flows are evident.\n- All interactions are with Azure SDK models and methods, which are standard for resource management scripts.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0 and very low security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for managing CDN profiles/endpoints.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both at 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar management functions.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; standard SDK usage, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.2 (still low).\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Management functions, similar pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same resource management.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code or data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for CDN management.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. The code is straightforward SDK wrapper functions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code appears safe, and the scoring aligns well with the analysis.",
