  "flows": "Input parameters -> SDK object construction -> SDK API invocation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of utility functions that interact with Azure SDKs to create, update, and list CDN resources. It does not perform network operations outside SDK calls, nor does it contain any obfuscated or malicious code. No secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The logic is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical resource management functions without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK wrapper functions for Azure CDN resource management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2 are accurate and justified.",
