  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as utility functions for managing Azure CDN profiles, endpoints, and custom domains via Azure SDKs.\n- They emphasize that the code constructs SDK model objects, calls SDK methods, and does not perform network requests, file operations, or execute untrusted code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, standard SDK wrapper functions with proper parameter handling.\n- All reports assign very high confidence (0.9) that the code is benign, with malware scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is consistent with typical Azure SDK usage. No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network, file, or code injection activities.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden malicious patterns:** None observed.\n- **Sensitive data handling:** No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code is a straightforward management utility.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the reports.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk due to standard SDK interactions.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Any higher score would be unjustified unless malicious activity or vulnerabilities were present.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (average ~0.15)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a typical SDK wrapper for Azure CDN resource management.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The low risk score appropriately reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe overall evaluation indicates that this code is safe, benign, and intended for legitimate resource management within Azure. No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (average ~0.15)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the detailed analysis.",
