{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing Azure CDN profiles and endpoints, including creation, update, and listing functions, as well as custom domain management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as resource_group_name, profile_name, endpoint_name, custom_domain_name, hostname, tags, and various configuration options; data fetched from Azure SDK clients.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK client methods that perform create, update, and list operations; data passed into these methods; no unsafe sinks such as network transmission of untrusted data or system commands are evident.",
  "flows": "User input parameters flow into Azure SDK client methods through constructed model objects (e.g., Endpoint, Profile); no evidence of untrusted data flow leading to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code primarily uses established SDK functions with standard parameter handling.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly utilizes Azure SDK models and utility functions to manage CDN profiles, endpoints, and custom domains. It employs safe practices such as default parameter values and controlled data assignments. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is structured and straightforward, focusing on cloud resource management without executing any system commands or network operations outside the SDK's scope. Overall, it appears benign and intended for legitimate cloud resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure CDN management utility module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected SDK operations without suspicious behaviors. The likelihood of malware or malicious behavior is very low.",
