  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard CLI argument parser for Azure CDN, with no malicious patterns or suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — negligible, given the purely configuration-focused code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as standard CLI argument handling with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The analysis is thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles CLI arguments for Azure CDN resources, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the lack of malicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, considering it's configuration code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard argument parsing with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, with focus on argument parsing and validation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, given the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Assessment:** No problems here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is purely argument parsing and validation, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the configuration nature; no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The `OriginType` class safely processes user input into SDK models without executing untrusted code or performing network operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is standard for CLI argument handling in Azure SDK extensions.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and maintainable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily because this code handles user input for resource configuration and does not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or concern is necessary.",
