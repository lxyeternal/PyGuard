  "purpose": "This code defines command-line argument parsing and validation for managing Azure CDN resources via a CLI.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments; values passed to argparse and custom validators.",
  "sinks": "Arguments processed by Azure SDK models and functions, potentially affecting resource creation or modification.",
  "flows": "User input -> validation and parsing -> passing to Azure SDK models for resource configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of standard Azure SDK models and argument handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and Azure SDK modules to define CLI argument parsers. The custom class 'OriginType' processes origin parameters, converting user input into Azure SDK model objects. The 'load_arguments' function defines argument contexts for various CDN components, specifying argument types, validators, and help texts. No code execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code focuses solely on CLI argument handling for Azure CDN resources, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI argument definition module for Azure CDN management, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It securely handles user inputs for resource configuration. The overall security risk is negligible.",
