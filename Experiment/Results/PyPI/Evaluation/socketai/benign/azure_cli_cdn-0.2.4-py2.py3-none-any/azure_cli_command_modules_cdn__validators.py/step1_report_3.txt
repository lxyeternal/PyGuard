{
  "purpose": "Validate the port ranges of origin objects within a namespace to ensure they fall within the valid TCP port range (1-65535).",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'namespace.origins' and the properties 'origin.http_port' and 'origin.https_port'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a CLIError with a formatted message if ports are outside the valid range, which may be used to communicate errors to the user.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'namespace.origins' -> Validation checks on 'origin.http_port' and 'origin.https_port' -> Possible CLIError thrown if invalid port values are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and aligns with standard validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for raising command-line errors and defines a function to check port ranges. It iterates over 'namespace.origins', modifying each origin's name by appending an index. It then validates 'http_port' and 'https_port' properties, raising an error if they fall outside the valid port range. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior. The logic is typical for input validation in CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard validation of port numbers for origin objects, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It safely raises errors for invalid input without performing any suspicious actions.",
