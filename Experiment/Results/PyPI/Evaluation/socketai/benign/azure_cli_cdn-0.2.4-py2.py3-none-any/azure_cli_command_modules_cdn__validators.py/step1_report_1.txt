{
  "purpose": "The code validates port ranges for origins in a namespace object, ensuring they are within valid TCP port numbers.",
  "sources": "Reads data from namespace.origins and origin attributes such as origin.name, origin.http_port, and origin.https_port.",
  "sinks": "Raises CLIError if port values are outside the valid range; no other output or data leakage occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data from namespace.origins and origin attributes flow into the check_port_range function, which raises errors if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; the code appears straightforward and standard for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of port ranges for origin objects within a namespace. It iterates over each origin, assigns an index-based name, and checks whether the specified ports are within the valid range (1-65535). It raises a CLIError if invalid ports are detected. No malicious or suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling mechanisms are present. The code is simple validation logic without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation routine for port ranges, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose within a CLI tool for validating user input.",
