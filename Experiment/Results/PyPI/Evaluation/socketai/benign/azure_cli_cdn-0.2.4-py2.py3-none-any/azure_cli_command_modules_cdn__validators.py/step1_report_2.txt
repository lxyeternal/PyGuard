  "purpose": "Validate the port ranges for origin configurations in a namespace object.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'namespace.origins' and its attributes 'name', 'http_port', 'https_port'.",
  "sinks": "Raises CLIError if port values are out of the specified range.",
  "flows": "Checks each origin's 'http_port' and 'https_port'; if invalid, raises an error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for error handling and defines a function to validate port ranges for origins. It iterates over 'namespace.origins', modifies each origin's name by appending its index, and checks if the ports are within 1-65535. If ports are outside this range, it raises a CLIError with an informative message. The logic is straightforward and appears to be input validation with no hidden or malicious behavior. There are no external data transmissions, credential handling, or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard input validation for port ranges within a CLI command context. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility function for configuration validation.",
