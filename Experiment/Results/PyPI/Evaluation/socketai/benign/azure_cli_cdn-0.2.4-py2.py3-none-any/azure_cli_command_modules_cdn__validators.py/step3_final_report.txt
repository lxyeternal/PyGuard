  "purpose": "Port range validation for origin objects within a namespace, ensuring ports are within 1-65535.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'namespace.origins', accesses 'origin.name', 'origin.http_port', and 'origin.https_port'.",
  "sinks": "Raises CLIError on invalid ports; modifies 'origin.name' during iteration.",
  "flows": "Iterates over 'namespace.origins' -> modifies 'origin.name' -> checks 'http_port' and 'https_port' -> raises error if out of range.",
  "anomalies": "Modifies 'origin.name' by appending index during iteration, which is unconventional but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward port validation, raising errors for invalid ports. It modifies 'origin.name' during iteration, which is unusual but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external data leaks are present. The validation logic is standard and safe. The modification of 'origin.name' does not impact security but could be flagged as a minor code smell. The malware score is 0, security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), and confidence is high (near 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard port validation routine with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the unconventional modification of 'origin.name', which does not constitute a security issue. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
