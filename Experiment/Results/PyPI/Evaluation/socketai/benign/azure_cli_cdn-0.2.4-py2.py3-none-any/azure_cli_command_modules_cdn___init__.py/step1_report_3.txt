{
  "purpose": "Define a command loader class for Azure CDN CLI commands within the Azure CLI framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor, method calls to load command tables and arguments",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands based on untrusted input",
  "flows": "Imports and class methods call other modules to register commands and parameters, but no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns. The code simply sets up command modules and imports other modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a CLI command loader class for Azure CDN commands. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with methods to load command tables and arguments, and registers this loader class. There is no evidence of data manipulation, untrusted input handling, or malicious behavior. All operations seem consistent with normal extension setup. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a command loader for Azure CDN CLI commands with no malicious intent. It functions to organize and register CLI commands without processing or transmitting sensitive data.",
