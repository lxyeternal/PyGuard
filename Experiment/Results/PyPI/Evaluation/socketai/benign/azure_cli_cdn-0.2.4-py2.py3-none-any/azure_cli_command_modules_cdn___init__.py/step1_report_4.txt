  "purpose": "This code defines a command loader class for Azure CDN CLI commands, setting up command types and loading command tables and parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as azure.cli.command_modules.cdn._help, azure.cli.core.commands, and azure.cli.core.profiles; class initialization and method calls load command data.",
  "sinks": "Method calls load command tables and arguments, but do not process untrusted data or execute external commands directly.",
  "flows": "Initialization imports modules -> class constructor sets up command type -> load_command_table and load_arguments methods call external functions to load commands and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns observed. The code primarily performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Azure CLI modules and defines a class for loading CDN command modules. The class constructor initializes command types with templates, and methods load command tables and arguments by calling external functions. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of untrusted data, or other suspicious patterns. The structure appears consistent with typical CLI extension loading code. No anomalies, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Azure CLI command loader for CDN commands with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
