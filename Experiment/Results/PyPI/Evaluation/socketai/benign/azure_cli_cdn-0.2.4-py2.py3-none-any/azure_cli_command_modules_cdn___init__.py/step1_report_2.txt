  "purpose": "This code initializes and defines a command loader class for Azure CDN CLI commands within the Azure CLI framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.command_modules.cdn and azure.cli.core, including potential dynamic loading of commands and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present; the code mainly sets up command registration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code loads modules and registers commands without handling external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard SDK setup code with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI command loader class for Azure CDN. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with initialization and loader methods, and registers command and parameter loading functions. No external inputs are processed, and no network or data exfiltration code is present. The structure is typical for SDK extensions, with no suspicious or malicious features observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK setup code for Azure CLI extension; it contains no malicious behavior, no malicious code, and poses no security risks. It simply facilitates command registration for CDN management.",
