{
  "purpose": "This code is a part of an Azure CLI extension module for managing CDN (Content Delivery Network) resources, primarily for loading command tables and arguments.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core and azure.cli.command_modules.cdn modules, which load external modules and commands.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to load_command_table and load_arguments, which execute external code from other modules.",
  "flows": "Imports from external modules → calling load_command_table and load_arguments functions with 'self' and 'args' or 'command' as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward, primarily class inheritance and function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a command loader class for Azure CDN commands, importing modules, defining class methods for loading command tables and arguments, and assigning the loader class to a variable. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; all imported modules are standard and related to Azure CLI extensions. No external data sources or sinks suggest malicious intent. The code functions as a typical CLI extension setup with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for Azure CLI extensions, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It performs routine module loading and command registration tasks without any suspicious patterns.",
