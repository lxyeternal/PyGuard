{
  "purpose": "This code defines a command loader class for Azure CDN CLI commands, enabling the registration and loading of CDN-related commands and parameters within the Azure CLI framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes such as 'azure.cli.command_modules.cdn._help', 'azure.cli.core', and submodules like 'commands' and '_params'. It also reads no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data processing points where untrusted data flows into vulnerable or sensitive operations. The code only sets up command types and loads modules.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive functions or commands; the code primarily loads modules and registers command types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears standard for CLI command registration and extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for Azure CLI command extension, defines a command loader class, and overrides methods to load command tables and arguments. It references a custom command type for CDN operations and cleanly loads command and parameter definitions. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The structure and content suggest standard CLI extension code with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Azure CLI extension component for CDN management, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply registers command modules and parameters as part of CLI extension setup.",
