{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command loader for Azure CLI CDN extension, registering command types and loading command tables and arguments.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from azure.cli.core and azure.cli.command_modules.cdn, and calls external functions load_command_table and load_arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> defines CdnCommandsLoader class -> initializes command type -> loads command table and arguments via external functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Azure CLI extension setup for CDN commands, involving module imports, class definition, and registration functions. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with its benign, routine nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code aligns with typical SDK extension patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Azure CLI extension component for CDN command registration, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
