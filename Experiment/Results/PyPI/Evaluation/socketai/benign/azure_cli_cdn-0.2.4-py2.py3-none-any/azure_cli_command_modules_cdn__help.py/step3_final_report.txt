{
  "purpose": "The code defines static help documentation strings for Azure CDN CLI commands, including command groups, commands, parameters, and examples. It serves as configuration for CLI help output, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments within the 'helps' dictionary, providing command descriptions and examples.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input handling, or external data flow occurs.",
  "flows": "None; static help text without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward documentation with no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static help documentation for Azure CDN commands. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All five reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the static, documentation-only nature of the code. Minor variations in risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable but unnecessary. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign static documentation for Azure CDN CLI commands, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and consistent with its nature.",
