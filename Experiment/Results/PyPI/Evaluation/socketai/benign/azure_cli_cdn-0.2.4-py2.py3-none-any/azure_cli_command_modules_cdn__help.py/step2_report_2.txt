  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:  \n   The provided code is a set of static string definitions that configure help documentation for Azure CDN management commands in the Azure CLI. It defines command groups, commands, parameters, and usage examples. The code is purely declarative, with no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**:  \n   - The code contains no user input handling, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated segments.\n   - It does not process or output untrusted data.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n   - The content is standard documentation strings for CLI commands, typical of SDK or CLI help files.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   All five reports concur that:\n   - The code is static, containing only help documentation.\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.\n   - The code does not process external or untrusted data.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The purpose is solely to provide help and usage guidance for Azure CDN CLI commands.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: Consistently 0 across all reports. This is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 or very close to it. Since the code is purely documentation, it poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:  \n   - The only minor note is in report 4, which assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1. Given the static nature, even this small value seems unnecessary; the risk is negligible.\n   - All other reports assign a risk score of 0, which is more accurate.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:  \n   - The code is benign, purely static help documentation.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the exception of the minor 0.1 in report 4, which could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Final Assessment and Recommendations**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should be **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Should be **0**. Clear, static strings.\n- **Risk Score**: Should be **0**. No security risk involved.\n\n**Overall**: The code is safe, standard documentation, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is purely static help documentation for Azure CLI commands related to CDN management. It contains no executable logic, no data processing, no network operations, and no malicious payloads. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the risk score at 0.",
