  "purpose": "The code provides help documentation and command definitions for managing Azure Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) via CLI commands.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code defines command metadata and help text for CLI usage.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or malicious actions; primarily static documentation and command structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process or execute untrusted input data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code contains only documentation strings and command help definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of structured help documentation for Azure CDN management CLI commands. It does not include runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors. The content appears to be standard SDK or CLI help documentation intended for user guidance, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of CLI help definitions and command specifications for managing Azure CDN resources. There are no malicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious code patterns. The overall security risk is negligible.",
