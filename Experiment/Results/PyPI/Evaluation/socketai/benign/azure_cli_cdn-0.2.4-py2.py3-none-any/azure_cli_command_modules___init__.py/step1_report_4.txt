  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, likely to organize or group related modules or packages.",
  "sources": "import statement for pkg_resources; declaration of namespace with pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs, no data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace, which is a standard practice in Python packaging for modular packages. There are no signs of malicious activity, no obfuscated code, and no data flows or untrusted inputs. The code is minimal, standard, and intended for namespace declaration only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign namespace declaration for Python package organization with no malicious intent or security risks.",
