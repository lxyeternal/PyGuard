  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling distribution of multiple packages under a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks detected",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; namespace declaration is static and does not involve untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Usage of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module from setuptools and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a common pattern for defining namespace packages. There are no input or output data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code behavior. The license comment and copyright statement are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is typical for namespace packages and contains no signs of sabotage or malware.",
