  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, typically used for modular package organization.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pkg_resources; declaration of namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace, which is a common pattern in Python packaging. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or potentially malicious activity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The code appears to be boilerplate for namespace package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard namespace package declaration with no malicious behavior detected. It poses no security risk.",
