{
  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, allowing for the distribution of multiple packages under a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and calling 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which reads module metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library ('pkg_resources') and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern used by namespace packages in Python, especially in larger projects with multiple distribution parts. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
