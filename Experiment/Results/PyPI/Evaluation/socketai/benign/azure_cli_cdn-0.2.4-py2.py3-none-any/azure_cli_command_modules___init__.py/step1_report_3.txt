  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The import of pkg_resources and the call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only declares namespace",
  "anomalies": "Use of declare_namespace is a known pattern for namespace packages; no anomalies present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace for the current package. This is a standard practice in Python packaging to support namespace packages. The code does not contain any input handling, data transmission, or other behaviors that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The file is minimal and appears to be part of a larger package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical, benign package setup fragment.",
