  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows present",
  "flows": "Importing pkg_resources -> declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and calls declare_namespace(__name__), a standard pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. It is static, straightforward, and does not perform any dynamic actions, data processing, or external communication. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-understood and widely used in Python packaging. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and no modifications to the scores or analysis are necessary.",
