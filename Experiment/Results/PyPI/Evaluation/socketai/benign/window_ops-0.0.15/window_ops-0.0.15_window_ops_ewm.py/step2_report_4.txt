  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Implements an EWMA calculation with `ewm_mean`.\n- Uses `@njit` from Numba for performance.\n- Imports `random` but does not use it.\n- Finds the first non-NaN value via `first_not_na`.\n- No external I/O, network calls, or suspicious code.\n- No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.\n- No malware or malicious behavior evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  All reports agree that the code performs a standard EWMA calculation. No anomalies or malicious code are detected.  \n  The only minor point is the unused `random` import, which is benign.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the report logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no malicious intent.  \n  No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, security risk around 0.1, and confidence levels at or near 0.9. These seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Slightly above zero (~0.1), mainly due to the unused import, which is minor. This is appropriate.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  High confidence (0.9-1) aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional observations:\n- The use of `@njit` from Numba is common for performance, not malicious.\n- The import of `random` is unused, possibly leftover code; this does not impact security.\n- No external data leaks, network calls, or backdoors are present.\n- The code handles NaNs via `first_not_na`, which is a standard approach.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, minor concern due to unused import)  \n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and free of malicious behavior.**  \nThe minor unused import does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk for this code is minimal. It is a benign, standard implementation of an EWMA calculation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. The minor unused import is a non-issue.",
