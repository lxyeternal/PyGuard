{
  "purpose": "Compute exponentially weighted mean (EWM) of a numerical array using a specified smoothing factor (alpha).",
  "sources": "Reads from the input_array parameter, specifically its size and data, and the first_not_na function which reads input data to find the first non-NaN index.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the function. No system calls, network operations, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input array is read to determine start index; data flows from input_array into output array during computation. No external or untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of the @njit decorator indicates code is compiled with Numba for performance, but no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution is evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to calculate exponentially weighted moving averages on a numpy array, handling NaN values with first_not_na. The function performs standard numerical computation without external data transmission or system interaction. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The import of 'random' appears unused, which is benign but may suggest leftover or preparatory code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an EWM calculation using Numba for speed. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. No security risks are identified based on the provided code fragment.",
