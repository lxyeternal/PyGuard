{
  "purpose": "Compute an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) on a numpy array, handling NaN values appropriately.",
  "sources": "Input array 'input_array' read during the EWMA calculation; 'first_not_na' function used to find starting index.",
  "sinks": "Output array 'output_array' where the EWMA results are stored; no external data sinks or transmissions are involved.",
  "flows": "Input array is read; 'first_not_na' determines start; then each element is processed sequentially to compute EWMA, storing results in 'output_array'.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'random' module; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard EWMA calculation with NaN handling via 'first_not_na'. It uses 'njit' for performance. No network, file I/O, or obfuscation is present. The only minor issue is the unused 'random' import, which does not impact security. The logic is straightforward, correct, and free of malicious behavior. Scores from reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of EWMA with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the unused 'random' import, which does not affect security. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
