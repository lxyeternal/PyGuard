  "purpose": "Calculate an exponentially weighted mean (EWM) of a numpy array with a given alpha, ignoring NaNs at the start.",
  "sources": "input_array parameter to ewm_mean function; first_not_na function imported from utils module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is written to external systems, nor is untrusted data used in a harmful way",
  "flows": "Input data is read from input_array; internal calculations and array updates do not involve untrusted sources or external outputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of @njit from numba for JIT compilation is standard for performance; no suspicious code behavior detected. Random module is imported but not used, which is benign but unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function ewm_mean that computes an exponentially weighted mean on a numpy array, starting after the first non-NaN value. It uses numba for JIT compilation for performance. The function imports random but does not use it, which is benign but slightly unusual. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The logic is straightforward and focused on numerical computation without external data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform a standard numerical operation with no signs of malicious intent. It is safe in the context of supply chain security. The presence of an unused import (random) is likely unintentional but does not impact security.",
