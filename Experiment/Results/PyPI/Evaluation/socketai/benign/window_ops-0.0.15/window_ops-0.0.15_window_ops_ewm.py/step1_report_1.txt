{
  "purpose": "Compute exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) for a numeric array.",
  "sources": "Input array 'input_array' and parameter 'alpha'.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a NumPy array with EWMA values; no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input array is read, and the EWMA is computed iteratively; output is generated as the result.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '@njit' from Numba for just-in-time compilation, which is common for performance but not malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ewm_mean' that calculates the exponentially weighted moving average of an input array. It imports necessary modules including 'random' (unused), 'numpy', and 'njit' from 'numba'. The function finds the first non-NA value in the array and initializes the output array with NaNs. It then sets the first non-NA value and iteratively computes the EWMA for subsequent elements. No external data, network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. The 'random' import is unused, which is benign but indicates possible leftover code. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of EWMA with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of EWMA calculation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only minor concern is the unused 'random' import, which is harmless but slightly unclean. No security risks or malware detected.",
