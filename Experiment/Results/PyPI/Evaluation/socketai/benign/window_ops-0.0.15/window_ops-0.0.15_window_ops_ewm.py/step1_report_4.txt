{
  "purpose": "This code computes an exponentially weighted mean (EWM) of a numerical input array, with the ability to handle missing values (NaNs).",
  "sources": "Input array `input_array`, `alpha` parameter",
  "sinks": "The output array `output_array`, which stores the computed EWM results",
  "flows": "Input array `input_array` -> `first_not_na` function -> loop updating `output_array` based on previous values and current input",
  "anomalies": "Use of `first_not_na` function, which may handle NaNs; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no network or file I/O; no unusual dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function `ewm_mean` that calculates an exponentially weighted moving average of the input array. It imports necessary modules, including `random` (unused), `numpy`, and `numba`. The function initializes an output array filled with NaNs, finds the first non-NaN index with `first_not_na`, then iterates through the array updating the output with the EWM formula. No external data sources or sinks are present. The code appears straightforward and mathematically correct for its purpose. The import of `random` is unused, but this does not pose security risk. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of an exponentially weighted mean calculation, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs its intended mathematical operation without any suspicious behavior.",
