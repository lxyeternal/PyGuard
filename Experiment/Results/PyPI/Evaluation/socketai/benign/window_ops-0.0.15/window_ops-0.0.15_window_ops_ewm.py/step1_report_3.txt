{
  "purpose": "The code implements an exponentially weighted mean (EWM) calculation using a recursive formula, likely for time series analysis or data smoothing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'input_array' and the constant 'alpha' passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'np.full_like' to generate an output array; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads data from 'input_array', uses 'first_not_na' to find start index, then iteratively computes weighted mean updating 'output_array'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'np.full_like' with 'np.nan'; the 'first_not_na' function suggests handling of NaN values, but no suspicious behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed. The 'random' import appears unused, which is benign but unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries and defines a function 'ewm_mean' decorated with 'njit' for performance. It initializes an output array filled with NaN, finds the first non-NaN index using 'first_not_na', and then iteratively calculates exponentially weighted mean values. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The 'random' module is imported but not used, which is harmless but indicates potential leftover code. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation of an EWM calculation, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data processing function for exponential weighted mean calculation with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The only minor anomaly is the unused 'random' import, which is benign.",
