{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated documentation or symbol index for a Python package related to window operations, including expanding, online, rolling, shifting, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from a dictionary structure that maps symbol names to their documentation URLs and source files.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak, such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the structure is purely declarative, listing symbols and their documentation references.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a static data structure; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. It is purely metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a dictionary containing documentation mappings for various modules and functions within a package. It includes symbol names, documentation URLs, and source file paths. There are no functions, input handling, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited. The content is consistent with autogenerated documentation or symbol index files. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are present. Since it is static metadata, the risk of malicious behavior is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, autogenerated symbol index for documentation purposes. It does not contain executable malicious code or behavior. There are no signs of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious activities. It appears to be benign metadata for a Python package.",
