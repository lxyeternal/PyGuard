  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's static nature, the absence of executable logic, and the context provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static dictionary mapping symbols to documentation URLs and source files.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing.\n- The code contains no obfuscated logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The URLs point to trusted sources (GitHub, documentation pages), not external or suspicious domains.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; the code is a symbol index for documentation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — static metadata with no security implications.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward structure.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correct; static symbol index.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign metadata.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Same reasoning applies; static documentation mapping.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Similar to above; static symbol index.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Again, a static index with no executable code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n**Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, static data structure.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the static, read-only nature and lack of any executable or dynamic behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate across all reports.\n\n**Additional justification:**  \nSince the code is purely a static mapping used for documentation or symbol indexing, it does not introduce any security vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The data is not derived from or processed with untrusted input, and no code execution is possible from this structure alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**Overall, this code is benign, safe, and does not pose any security risks.**",
