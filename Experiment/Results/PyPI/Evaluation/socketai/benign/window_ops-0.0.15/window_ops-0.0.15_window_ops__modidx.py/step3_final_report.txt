{
  "purpose": "Static mapping of symbol names to documentation URLs and source files, serving as an autogenerated symbol index or documentation reference.",
  "sources": "Predefined static dictionary containing symbol keys mapped to URL and file path tuples.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static data structure.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static symbol-to-URL mappings with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns; straightforward static data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, nested dictionary representing symbol references for documentation purposes. It contains no executable logic, no user input handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. All symbols are mapped to trusted URLs and source files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The structure is simple and human-readable, indicating autogenerated documentation or symbol index data. The absence of any external data flow, code injection, or malicious patterns confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, autogenerated documentation index with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
