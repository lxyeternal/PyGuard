{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be autogenerated documentation or symbol index for a Python package related to window operations, such as expanding, rolling, and online statistical calculations. It is intended for documentation or code navigation purposes, not for executing core logic directly.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the symbol dictionary definitions, primarily string identifiers, and URLs pointing to documentation or source files.",
  "sinks": "There are no typical sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command execution. The code does not contain functions that execute external commands or access environment variables directly.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the symbol definitions to documentation links; no untrusted input or data flow is evident that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of static data structures defining symbol mappings. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a static data structure, likely part of a generated documentation index. It contains no functions, input handling, or executable logic. There are no sources of untrusted input, nor any sinks that could process such input maliciously. The structure and content are consistent with standard symbol indexing for documentation purposes. The URLs point to documentation files, not network or system commands. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static symbol mapping for documentation purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain executable or exploitable code components.",
