  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies this as a static documentation index mapping symbols to URLs and files.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external data handling; purely static.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, no malicious activity, high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Also correctly identifies as static metadata for documentation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system interactions.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic execution.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Similar to previous, static symbol index for documentation.  \n- No data flow, external input, or malicious code.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: benign, no security risk.  \n- Scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: static metadata for documentation, no executable logic.  \n- No data flows, no external interactions, no obfuscation.  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: safe.  \n- Scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Again, static symbol references with URLs, no runtime code.  \n- No external data handling, no dynamic execution.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: safe.  \n- Scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**  \nAll reports consistently identify the code as static, autogenerated documentation or symbol index data, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0) are reasonable and appropriate given the content.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, static data.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments needed. The code is benign, purely metadata for documentation purposes, with no malicious or security concern.",
