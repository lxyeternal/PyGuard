{
  "purpose": "The function 'shift_array' shifts elements of a numpy array by a specified offset, filling the vacated positions with NaN.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'input_array', 'offset' parameter within the function",
  "sinks": "Return value 'output_array' which contains the shifted data; no external sinks or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "Input array is read, and shifted values are written into a new array which is returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling or external communication",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and numba, defines a function to shift array elements by a given offset, and fills vacated positions with NaN. It uses 'np.full_like' to create the output array and performs the shift with a simple loop. No external data sources or sinks, no code injection, no encryption, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The function appears standard for data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward array shift function with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified. It performs data manipulation only and does not include any suspicious behavior.",
