{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to shift the elements of a numpy array by a specified offset, filling the vacated positions with NaN.",
  "sources": "The input_array parameter, which is provided as an argument to the shift_array function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input array is taken as source; the function processes it and returns a shifted array. No data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. The code uses numpy and numba for performance optimization. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports numpy and numba, then defines a njit-compiled function that shifts array elements by a given offset, filling the remaining entries with NaN. No external inputs beyond the array argument, no external outputs or network activity, no suspicious code patterns. The purpose appears to be data manipulation within a numerical computing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for array manipulation with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external data leaks.",
