{
  "purpose": "The function shifts the elements of a NumPy array by a specified offset, filling vacated positions with NaN.",
  "sources": "The input_array parameter, which receives an array to be shifted.",
  "sinks": "The returned output_array which contains the shifted data with NaN fill-ins.",
  "flows": "Input array -> shift_array function -> shifted array with NaN fill-in.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. Usage of 'np.nan' and array shifting are standard numeric operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'shift_array' that uses numba's JIT compiler for performance. It takes an input array and an offset, creates a new array filled with NaN, and shifts the input array elements by the specified offset within the output array. The logic is straightforward, with no external data sources, network connections, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a utility for array manipulation, typical in data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard array-shifting utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It performs a common numeric operation safely and efficiently.",
