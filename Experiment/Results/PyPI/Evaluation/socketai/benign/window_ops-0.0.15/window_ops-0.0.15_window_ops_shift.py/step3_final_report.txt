{
  "purpose": "A utility function to shift elements of a NumPy array by a specified offset, filling vacated positions with NaN.",
  "sources": "Input array passed as 'input_array' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the function processes data internally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Input array -> shift operation within loop -> output array with shifted data and NaNs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation. Potential edge case if 'offset' is negative or exceeds array length, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, efficient array shifting function using numpy and numba. It creates an output array filled with NaN and shifts elements by the specified offset. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The function performs a common data manipulation task with no security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for array manipulation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
