  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of data input, output, control flow, or external dependencies.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly conclude that this is benign, standard version declaration code.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign assessment.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores since there's no indication of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is entirely benign, and the current scoring accurately reflects its nature.",
