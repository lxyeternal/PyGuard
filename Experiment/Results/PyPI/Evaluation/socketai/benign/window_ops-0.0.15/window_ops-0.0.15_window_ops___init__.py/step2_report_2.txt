  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, control flows, or external dependencies.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n   - Since the code is purely declarative with no malicious or risky behavior, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious assumptions are made in the reports.\n   - The analysis is consistent with the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, all scores are appropriate. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious activity or behavior detected.                |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.       |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No security issues or vulnerabilities present.             |\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The code is safe, and no further action is necessary.",
