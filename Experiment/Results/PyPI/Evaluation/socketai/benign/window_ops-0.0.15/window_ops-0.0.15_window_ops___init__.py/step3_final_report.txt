{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as metadata in a Python package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; simple assignment operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python packages, with no input/output, external dependencies, or control flow. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code poses no security threat and is typical in open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
