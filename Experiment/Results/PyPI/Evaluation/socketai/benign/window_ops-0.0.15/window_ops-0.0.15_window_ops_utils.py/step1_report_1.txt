  "purpose": "Utility functions for numerical computations and array processing, including validation and comparison functions.",
  "sources": "Reads from numpy arrays, specifically np.ndarray in first_not_na function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input array processed to find first non-NaN index; validation functions process integer inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward utility functions with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for validation, comparison, and array processing. The use of numba's njit suggests optimization for performance, not malicious intent. Functions operate on numerical data, with no external data transmission, credential handling, or system manipulation. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard numerical utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
