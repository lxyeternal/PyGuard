  "purpose": "Utility functions for numerical data validation and comparison, including window size validation, floating-point comparisons, and finding the first non-NaN index in an array.",
  "sources": "Input numpy array for 'first_not_na'; function parameters for '_validate_rolling_sizes'; floating-point values for '_gt' and '_lt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions operate solely on provided inputs without external communication or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions without external transmission; internal computations are straightforward and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; use of 'njit' is for performance, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises simple, well-understood utility functions with no external dependencies or side effects. All functions perform standard operations: validation, comparison, and array scanning. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of 'njit' from numba optimizes performance but does not introduce security concerns. The code is deterministic, with no external data handling or network activity. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. It functions as intended for utility purposes without security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
