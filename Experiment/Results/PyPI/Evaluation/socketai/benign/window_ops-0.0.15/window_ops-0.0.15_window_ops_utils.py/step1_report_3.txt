  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation and comparison, including a function to find the first non-NaN value in an array.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameter 'input_array' in the 'first_not_na' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading 'input_array' in 'first_not_na' to returning the index of the first non-NaN element.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses '@njit' for performance optimization; no suspicious or unusual code constructs or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions, with '_validate_rolling_sizes' ensuring valid window sizes, '_gt' and '_lt' for comparison operations, and 'first_not_na' to locate the first non-NaN index in an array. All functions are straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent. Usage of 'njit' appears to be for performance enhancement rather than obfuscation or malicious purpose. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions intended for data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs simple, transparent operations with no external effects.",
