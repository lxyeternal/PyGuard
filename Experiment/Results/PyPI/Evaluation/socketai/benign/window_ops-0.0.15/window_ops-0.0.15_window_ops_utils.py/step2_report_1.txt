  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code consists of utility functions:\n     - `_validate_rolling_sizes`: Validates window size and minimum samples.\n     - `_gt` and `_lt`: Floating-point comparison helpers.\n     - `first_not_na`: Finds the index of the first non-NaN value in a numpy array.\n   - All functions are straightforward, perform standard operations, and are optimized with `@njit` from numba for performance.\n\n2. **Sources and Sinks:**\n   - The functions operate solely on numpy arrays or integer inputs.\n   - No external data sources, no data transmission, no external communication, and no side effects are present.\n\n3. **Flows and Anomalies:**\n   - Data flows are internal and simple.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n   - The use of `njit` is for performance, not obfuscation or malicious purposes.\n\n4. **Analysis and Conclusions from Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard utility functions.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), and all scores reflect no malware or security risks.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk score:** 0, since there's no indication of security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The code is simple, well-understood, and free of suspicious patterns.\n   - The use of `njit` does not introduce obfuscation or malicious behavior; it's a performance optimization.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; the code does not process untrusted data in a risky way, nor does it perform any external operations.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's actual behavior.",
