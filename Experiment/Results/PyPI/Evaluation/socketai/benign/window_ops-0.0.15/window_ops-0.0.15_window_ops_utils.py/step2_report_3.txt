  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Functionality Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists of utility functions: `_validate_rolling_sizes`, `_gt`, `_lt`, and `first_not_na`.\n   - All functions operate on numerical data, mainly arrays, with straightforward logic.\n   - No external data handling, network communication, or credential management is present.\n   - The use of `@njit` from numba indicates performance optimization, not obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - The functions are standard in numerical and data processing contexts.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n   - They correctly identify that the functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - No issues are found with the logic or reasoning in the reports.\n   - The reports' assessments align well with the code's actual behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The `risk` scores are all 0 or very low, which is consistent.\n   - The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.\n   - The code performs utility functions with no external side effects.\n   - No obfuscation or hidden behavior is present.\n   - Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as safe.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions or speculative vulnerabilities are suggested.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and code review.\n   - No discrepancies or overestimations are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is straightforward, well-documented, and performs standard numerical utility functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of numba's `@njit` is a performance optimization, not an obfuscation or malicious tactic.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
