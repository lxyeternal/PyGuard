  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation and comparisons, including identifying the first non-NaN value in an array.",
  "sources": "The function 'first_not_na' reads the input array to find the first non-NaN element.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks; the code does not write or transmit data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Input array is read by 'first_not_na' to locate the first non-NaN value; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears standard for data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions with validation, comparison, and search capabilities, all within typical data processing scope. Uses numba for performance optimization, which is common. No hardcoded secrets, external system interaction, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on utility functions for array processing with no malicious intent or security risks.",
