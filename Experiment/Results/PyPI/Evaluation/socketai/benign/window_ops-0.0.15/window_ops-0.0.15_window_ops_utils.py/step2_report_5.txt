  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines utility functions:\n     - `_validate_rolling_sizes`: Validates window size parameters.\n     - `_gt` and `_lt`: Floating-point comparison helpers.\n     - `first_not_na`: Finds the index of the first non-NaN value in an array.\n   - All functions are straightforward, operating on numerical data.\n   - Usage of `@njit` from Numba indicates performance optimization, not obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - No external data transmission, no system modifications, no credential handling, or obfuscated code.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - The functions are purely computational, with no evident side effects.\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external communications.\n   - The purpose is clearly utility-based, common in numerical data processing.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0, security risk = 0, and obfuscated = 0.\n   - Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), which aligns with the straightforward, benign analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n   - The use of `njit` is standard for performance and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is safe, standard utility functions.\n   - No modifications needed in the scores or analysis.\n   - The overall risk is negligible, with no malware or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
