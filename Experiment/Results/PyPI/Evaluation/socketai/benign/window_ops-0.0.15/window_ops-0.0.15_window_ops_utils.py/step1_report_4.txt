  "purpose": "Utility functions for numerical and array operations, including validation and comparison functions.",
  "sources": "Reading input arrays (np.ndarray in first_not_na). No external data inputs or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data outputs or external communications. The functions are purely computational.",
  "flows": "Input array data flows through first_not_na to find the first non-NaN value; validation and comparison functions do not flow data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The functions are standard numerical utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for validating window sizes, comparing floating-point numbers, and identifying the first non-NaN element in an array. All functions are straightforward, using standard numpy and numba for performance. No data leaks, external communications, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears safe and typical for numerical data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performs standard utility operations, and poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
