  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code provides utility functions:\n     - `_validate_rolling_sizes`: Ensures window sizes and minimum samples are within valid ranges.\n     - `_gt` and `_lt`: Floating-point comparison helpers.\n     - `first_not_na`: Finds the index of the first non-NaN value in an array.\n   - It uses `numba`'s `@njit` for performance optimization.\n   - The functions are straightforward, with no complex logic, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No external communication, data leaks, or credential handling.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No obfuscation or code that manipulates system state maliciously.\n   - The use of `numba` is for performance, not obfuscation.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard utility functions, with no malicious intent.\n   - They assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0.\n   - Their confidence levels are high (1.0), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues found that would warrant higher scores.\n   - The code's purpose is clear, and no assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary.\n   - The use of `njit` does not introduce security concerns; it's a performance optimization.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, benign, and performs standard utility functions. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No further action needed; the code poses no security risks.",
