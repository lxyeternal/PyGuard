  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation and comparison, including finding the first non-NaN index in an array.",
  "sources": "Input array 'input_array' in the function 'first_not_na'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; functions perform internal calculations and array processing.",
  "flows": "Input array -> check for NaN -> return index of first non-NaN element.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures; functions are straightforward and well-defined.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions with some use of numba for performance. '_validate_rolling_sizes' ensures window and min_samples are consistent; '_gt' and '_lt' perform comparison operations. 'first_not_na' iterates through the input array to find the first non-NaN value, returning its index or the array size if none found. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious logic, or external data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for data processing without malicious behavior or security risks.",
