{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for expanding and seasonal expanding statistical calculations (mean, std, max, min) using Numba for JIT compilation, aimed at time series analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is received from input numpy arrays provided to each function, typically representing time series data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations (like network transmission, file writing, or environment variable usage) are present.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed by internal functions that apply rolling operations; no external data flows or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses Numba's njit for performance; no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or unusual constructs are present. All functions perform straightforward statistical computations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for expanding window calculations: mean, std, max, and min, both standard and seasonal variants. These functions utilize a common internal method (_expanding_op) with Numba for speed. The seasonal functions similarly wrap internal operations with seasonal parameters. There are no signs of malicious logic such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a performance-oriented implementation of statistical rolling operations for time series data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of performance-optimized statistical functions for time series analysis with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe.",
