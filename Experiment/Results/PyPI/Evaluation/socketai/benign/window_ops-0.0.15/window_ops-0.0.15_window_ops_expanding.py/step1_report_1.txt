{
  "purpose": "This code implements expanding window calculations (mean, std, max, min) and seasonal expanding window calculations for time series data, optimized with Numba JIT compilation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arrays passed to functions like expanding_mean, expanding_std, seasonal_expanding_mean, etc.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input to lead to data leaks or system effects; functions perform numerical computations within numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed through Numba-compiled functions which apply rolling window operations; data flows from input arrays to computed output arrays within these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code relies on standard mathematical operations and external rolling functions, assuming they are safe. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several expanding and seasonal expanding window functions, utilizing Numba for performance. It wraps existing rolling operations imported from a module. No malicious patterns, such as network calls, file operations, or credential handling, are present. The code performs standard numerical processing for time series analysis. No anomalies or signs of sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of expanding and seasonal expanding window functions for numerical time series analysis, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
