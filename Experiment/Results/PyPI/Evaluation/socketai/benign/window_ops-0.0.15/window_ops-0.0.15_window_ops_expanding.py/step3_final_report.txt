{
  "purpose": "Implementations of expanding window calculations (mean, std, max, min) and their seasonal variants for time series analysis, optimized with Numba.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays provided to functions; external 'rolling' functions imported from '.rolling'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions return processed numpy arrays without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input arrays flow through _expanding_op or _seasonal_expanding_op to respective rolling functions, producing output arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard numerical operations for time series analysis, relying on external 'rolling' functions assumed to be safe. It uses Numba for performance, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are straightforward, processing numpy arrays, and do not involve external system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, performance-optimized implementation of expanding window functions for time series data, with no malicious or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
