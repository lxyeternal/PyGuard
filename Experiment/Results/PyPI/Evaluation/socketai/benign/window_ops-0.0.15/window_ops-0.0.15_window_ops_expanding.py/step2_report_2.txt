  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Functionality**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code implements expanding window calculations (mean, std, max, min) and their seasonal variants, optimized with Numba. The functions rely on external \"rolling\" functions, which are imported but not included here. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for time series analysis.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - No network calls, file operations, environment variable manipulations, or other typical malicious patterns are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n   - The functions process numerical data and return computed arrays; no data exfiltration or external influence is observed.\n   - The reliance on external \"rolling\" functions is standard for modular code but warrants ensuring these are benign, which the reports assume.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious patterns.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports give very low or zero, indicating minimal security risk. Given the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior, this seems appropriate.\n\n4. **Analysis of Anomalies & Claims**:\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behavior are identified across all reports.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as legitimate, focusing on statistical calculations for time series.\n\n5. **Confidence Levels**:\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code and the lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Potential Concerns & Recommendations**:\n   - The main point of attention is the external \"rolling\" functions imported from `.rolling`. Their safety is assumed but should be verified to ensure they do not contain malicious code.\n   - Since the code is primarily mathematical and relies on well-known libraries (numpy, numba), the security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and intended for numerical time series analysis.**  \nNo modifications to the scores are necessary based on the provided reports.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- To strengthen security assurance, review the implementation of the imported \"rolling\" functions.\n- Ensure the environment where this code runs does not allow untrusted input to influence the functions unexpectedly, but based on current information, this is not a concern.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of expanding window functions with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
