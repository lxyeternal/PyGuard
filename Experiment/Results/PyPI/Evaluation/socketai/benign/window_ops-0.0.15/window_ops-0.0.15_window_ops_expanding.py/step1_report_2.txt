{
  "purpose": "The code implements expanding statistical functions (mean, std, min, max) and seasonal expanding variants, likely for time series analysis.",
  "sources": "The functions process input arrays provided as parameters, specifically 'input_array' and 'x' which are np.ndarray objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code performs computations on arrays and does not output or store data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the expanding and seasonal expanding functions, which then use lower-level rolling operations to produce output arrays.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses Numba's njit for performance; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are evident. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for expanding statistics, utilizing Numba for just-in-time compilation. It calls imported 'rolling' functions for calculations. There are no suspicious data handling or external communication patterns. The code appears straightforward, focusing on statistical transformations for data analysis. The use of 'np.ndarray' inputs and mathematical operations is standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of statistical expanding functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle external untrusted data in a way that would cause security concerns. No malware or obfuscation is detected.",
