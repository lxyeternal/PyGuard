{
  "purpose": "This code implements expanding window calculations (mean, std, min, max) and their seasonal variants using JIT compilation for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input arrays provided to functions like expanding_mean, expanding_std, seasonal_expanding_mean, etc.",
  "sinks": "Data flows through the _expanding_op and _seasonal_expanding_op functions, which call external rolling functions such as rolling_mean, rolling_std, etc.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into expanding functions, which then call underlying rolling operations (presumably defined elsewhere), and return the computed statistics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior present. The code primarily defines mathematical operations. No network, file, or environment variable manipulation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes numpy and numba for high-performance computations, specifically implementing expanding window statistical functions. It relies on external rolling functions (imported from .rolling) for core calculations, but these are not included in the snippet. The functions are straightforward wrappers applying the rolling functions over the entire array or seasonal segments. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a time-series analysis library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of expanding window calculations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe, well-structured, and intended for statistical computation on numerical data.",
