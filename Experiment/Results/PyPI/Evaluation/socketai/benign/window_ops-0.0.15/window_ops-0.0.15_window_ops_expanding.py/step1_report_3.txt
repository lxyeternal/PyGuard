{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for expanding and seasonal expanding statistical operations (mean, std, min, max) on numerical data arrays, likely for time series analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy.ndarray objects passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to potential data leaks, external network communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into statistical functions (_expanding_op, _seasonal_expanding_op) which process the data using imported rolling functions, then return the results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code relies on standard libraries and Numba for JIT compilation; no dynamic code execution or external network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions for expanding calculations on numpy arrays, utilizing Numba's njit for performance. It employs imported rolling functions (assumed to be standard or benign). There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. All functions serve statistical processing within a typical data analysis context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of expanding and seasonal expanding statistical functions for numerical data analysis. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
