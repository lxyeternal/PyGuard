  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements expanding window calculations (mean, std, max, min) and seasonal variants, optimized with Numba. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security concerns identified.\n- **Justification:** The functions perform standard numerical operations on numpy arrays, relying on imported 'rolling' functions assumed to be safe. No external network calls, file access, or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on statistical expanding functions, no suspicious patterns, and standard data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, perhaps considering minimal assumptions, but overall negligible.\n- **Justification:** No external communication, secrets, or suspicious constructs. The use of Numba and numpy is standard for performance optimization.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; the slight security risk is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard expanding window functions with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Justification:** Functions are typical for time series analysis, with no external side effects or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security concerns.\n- **Justification:** The code relies on external rolling functions, but nothing suspicious is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, straightforward statistical functions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Justification:** No external communication, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, performance-optimized implementation of expanding window calculations for time series data, relying on external, presumably safe, rolling functions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are reasonable and justified based on the code analysis.",
