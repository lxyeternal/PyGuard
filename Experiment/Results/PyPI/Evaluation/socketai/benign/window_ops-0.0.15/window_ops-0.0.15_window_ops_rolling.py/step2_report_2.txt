  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Overall Content & Purpose of the Code:**\n- The code implements various rolling statistical functions (mean, std, max, min, correlation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, days with sales) and seasonal variants.\n- It uses numpy and numba for performance.\n- Input data is handled via numpy arrays; no external or untrusted data sources are directly accessed.\n- Results are returned as numpy arrays; no external data exfiltration, file writing, or network communication is observed.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and standard in approach.\n\n**Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- No external system interactions, credentials, or network calls.\n- Use of numba's njit is for performance, not concealment.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or code patterns.\n\n**Analysis of Scores & Risk:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risks (mostly 0.1).\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0).\n- The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's straightforward statistical implementation.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n- No external data leaks or malicious operations are present.\n- The functions are purely computational, with no side effects or external interactions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The current malware scores of 0 are justified.\n- Security risk scores are appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n- The high confidence levels are consistent with the code's clarity and purpose.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to performance optimization features, not security concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is a legitimate, performance-optimized statistical utility library for time series analysis with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Given the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the existing scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
