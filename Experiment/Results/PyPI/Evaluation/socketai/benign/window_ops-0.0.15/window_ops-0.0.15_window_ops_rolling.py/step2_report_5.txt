  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, reasoning, and score justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward statistical functions, no obfuscation, no external data leaks, no malicious behavior. Uses Numba for optimization.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with benign assessment.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is evident. The use of Numba is performance optimization, not obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard statistical functions, no external data leaks, no suspicious code. Numba for performance.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard statistical functions, no external system interactions, no obfuscation. Focused on in-memory calculations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — safe.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard rolling statistics, no external communication, no suspicious code. Uses Numba for performance.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal security risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified; the code is a typical data analysis utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—standard statistical functions, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the straightforward implementation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and aligned with the code content.\n- The high confidence levels reflect the thorough, standard implementation of statistical functions.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, given the benign nature and utility focus.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the code's safety. The code appears to be a legitimate, performance-optimized library for time series analysis with no security concerns.",
