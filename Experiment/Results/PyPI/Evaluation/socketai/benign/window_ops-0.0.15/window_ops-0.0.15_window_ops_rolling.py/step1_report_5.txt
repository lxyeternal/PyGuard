{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions for computing rolling and seasonal statistical metrics (mean, std, max, min, correlation, CV, kurtosis, days with sales) on numerical data arrays, primarily for time series analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments such as input_array, x, or input_array slices for seasonal processing.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations and returns processed NumPy arrays; it does not send data externally, write to files, or execute network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through statistical computations (e.g., mean, std, max, min), including seasonal and windowed operations, and results are returned as arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code employs standard statistical algorithms and Numba for performance; no obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are observed. No data leakage, environment variable usage, or external system access is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical computations with numpy and numba, including rolling and seasonal calculations, using well-known algorithms and practices. It contains no indications of malicious intent, such as network calls, file manipulation, or obfuscation. Functions are modular and focused on statistical analysis, with appropriate input validation. The use of Numba for JIT compilation aims to optimize performance, not to conceal malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of statistical functions for time series analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows standard practices and employs no suspicious techniques. The overall security risk is minimal.",
