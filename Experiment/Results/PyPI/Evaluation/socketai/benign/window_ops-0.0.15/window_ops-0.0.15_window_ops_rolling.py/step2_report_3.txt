  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, based on the code provided.\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n- The code implements various rolling window statistical functions (mean, std, max, min, correlation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, days with sales, seasonal variants).\n- Uses numpy for computations and numba's njit for performance optimization.\n- Functions operate solely on numpy arrays passed as arguments.\n- No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or environment variables.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious variable names, or hidden logic.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of statistical analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes statistical functions, no external data sources, no suspicious sinks.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- Malware score: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal, due to general nature, not due to malicious intent)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. The low security risk is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, standard statistical functions.\n- Analysis: No external data, no suspicious operations, no obfuscation.\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0 (correct)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The functions are straightforward, and no malicious activity is apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar statistical functions, no external data sources.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0 (correct)\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, statistical calculations for time series.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no external communication, no obfuscation.\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0 (correct)\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical data analysis utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar, for time series analysis.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security risk: 0.1 (acceptable, given the benign nature)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, around 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond the minimal inherent risk of in-memory statistical calculations, which is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, performance-optimized library for time series statistical analysis, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
