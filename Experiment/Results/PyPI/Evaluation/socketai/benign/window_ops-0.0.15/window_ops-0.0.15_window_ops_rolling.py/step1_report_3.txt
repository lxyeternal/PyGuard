{
  "purpose": "The code implements various rolling and seasonal statistical functions for time series analysis, such as mean, std, max, min, correlation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, and days with sales.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from np.ndarray objects, primarily input_array and x variables in functions; these are typically passed as arguments, no external data sources are directly accessed within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it performs purely mathematical computations on provided data arrays without writing to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through rolling window calculations, with intermediate steps involving mean, std, or comparison functions, resulting in output arrays with computed metrics. No untrusted external data sources or outputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code uses standard mathematical operations and Numba JIT compilation for performance. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides well-structured, standard implementations of rolling statistical functions for time series analysis, using typical approaches and Numba for acceleration. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system interference, or backdoors, are evident. All data handling is confined to in-memory numpy arrays. The functions are designed for data analysis purposes without external side effects or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, performance-optimized implementation of statistical tools for time series analysis, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
