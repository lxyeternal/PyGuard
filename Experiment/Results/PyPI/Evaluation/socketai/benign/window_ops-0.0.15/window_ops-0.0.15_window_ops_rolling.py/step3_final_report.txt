{
  "purpose": "Implementation of various rolling window statistical functions (mean, std, max, min, correlation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, days with sales, and seasonal variants) for time series analysis.",
  "sources": "Input arrays provided as function arguments; no external data sources, network calls, or file operations.",
  "sinks": "No data exfiltration, network communication, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through in-memory computations within each function; no external sinks or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard statistical functions optimized with numba's njit for performance. It handles NaNs appropriately, uses well-known algorithms (e.g., Welford's for std, kurtosis calculation), and operates solely on numpy arrays. No external dependencies or malicious patterns are evident. The functions are straightforward, with clear logic and proper edge case handling. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The malware score is justified as 0, and security risk is minimal, around 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of in-memory statistical calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, performance-optimized library for time series statistical analysis. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
