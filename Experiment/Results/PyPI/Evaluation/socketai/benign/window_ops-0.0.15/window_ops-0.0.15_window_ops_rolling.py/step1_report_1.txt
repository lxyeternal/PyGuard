{
  "purpose": "The code provides various functions to compute rolling statistical metrics (mean, std, max, min, correlation, CV, kurtosis, etc.) on time series data, including seasonal adjustments.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from provided np.ndarray objects within each function; no external input sources are directly used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks in the code appear to handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. The functions return computed numpy arrays; no data exfiltration or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through statistical computations, with no external or untrusted data being written or sent outside the process.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard implementation of statistical functions with no obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs in-memory statistical calculations on numpy arrays using Numba for performance. It includes functions for rolling windows, seasonal adjustments, and various statistical metrics. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation. The use of 'njit' is for optimization, not obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of statistical analysis functions for time series data, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate, performance-optimized library for data analysis.",
