{
  "purpose": "The code implements various online statistical and mathematical operations such as rolling means, maxima, minima, standard deviations, expanding means, maxima, minima, standard deviations, seasonal variants, exponential weighted means, and shift operations. These are used for real-time data analysis and time series feature extraction.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data primarily through method parameters (e.g., in fit_transform methods) and class initializations. It also reads the data array 'x' in multiple methods for computations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations. It does not write data externally, make network requests, or handle sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays 'x' during fit_transform into various statistical calculations. During updates, new data points are incorporated into internal state variables (e.g., moving averages, min/max trackers). There are no external or untrusted data sources besides input arrays.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard implementations of statistical operations without suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. There are no obfuscated code segments, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables. No external system calls or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for online and seasonal statistical computations, with clear methods for fitting and updating data. Usage of external libraries is limited to numpy and math modules, with functions imported from other parts of the package (e.g., expanding, ewm, rolling, shift). The implementation seems straightforward and consistent with typical data analysis patterns. No suspicious code behaviors, security flaws, or malicious logic are identified. No sensitive information handling or insecure practices are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data processing classes for real-time statistical analysis. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks. Overall, it appears safe and intended for legitimate data analysis purposes.",
