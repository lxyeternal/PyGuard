{
  "purpose": "The code implements various online statistical and signal processing functions such as rolling, expanding, seasonal, and exponential weighted means for real-time data analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input arrays, class attributes, and new incoming data points through method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Computed results are returned by methods; no direct data sinks like file writes or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input arrays flow into fit_transform methods; data is processed and results are returned; update methods modify internal state based on new data points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are observed. The code relies on standard mathematical and numpy operations. No malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for online statistical calculations, utilizing functions like rolling_mean, expanding_mean, ewm_mean, and others imported from local modules. It employs straightforward data structures and algorithms for updating statistical measures incrementally. No external I/O operations, network communications, or hidden behaviors are detected. The implementation appears standard and appropriate for data analysis tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign implementation of online statistical functions without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for data processing within Python environments, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
