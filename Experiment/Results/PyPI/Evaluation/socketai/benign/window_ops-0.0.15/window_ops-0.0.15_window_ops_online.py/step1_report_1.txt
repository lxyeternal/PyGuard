{
  "purpose": "This code defines various classes for online and seasonal online statistical calculations such as rolling means, maxima, minima, standard deviations, expanding means, maxima, minima, standard deviations, exponential weighted means, and shifting operations, primarily for data analysis and time series processing.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input arrays (e.g., in fit_transform methods) and new data points provided via update methods. The code also reads array slices for seasonal processing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this code; no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network locations. No potentially dangerous output or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through fit_transform methods into internal state variables, and then update methods process new incoming data points, modifying internal state without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard mathematical operations, numpy functions, and class structures consistent with statistical data processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements various online statistical methods, with clear class structures, proper method definitions, and standard numpy operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. All functions serve typical data analysis purposes. The update and fit_transform methods operate solely on internal data structures and numpy arrays, with no unsafe or insecure operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of online and seasonal statistical calculators for data analysis. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured data processing module.",
