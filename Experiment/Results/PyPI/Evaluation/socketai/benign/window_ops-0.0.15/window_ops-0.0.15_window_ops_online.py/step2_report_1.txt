  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a collection of classes for online and seasonal statistical calculations, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code performs standard statistical computations with no external system interactions or suspicious patterns.\n- **Verdict:** The scoring is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is standard statistical processing with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning supports the low scores. The code is straightforward, with no external side-effects or security concerns.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is for online statistical calculations, with no malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning confirms the benign nature. The code only performs internal calculations.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements online statistical estimators, with no external communication or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The detailed review aligns with the low scores. No external side-effects or security issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for online statistical functions, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious activities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis supports the low risk and malware scores. The code is standard for data analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a legitimate implementation of online statistical functions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are consistent with the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured data analysis module. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malware or obfuscation. The scores are justified based on the provided analyses.",
