{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for online and seasonal statistical calculations, including moving averages, maxima, minima, standard deviations, and their expanding and seasonal variants, primarily for data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data arrays during fit_transform methods and new data points during update methods, utilizing internal state variables such as windows and accumulated sums.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks, network communications, or system calls; all operations are internal computations and state updates.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays or new data points through internal class states (windows, accumulators) to produce updated statistical metrics; no external side effects occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for online and seasonal statistical estimators, all performing standard calculations with no external interactions. The implementation is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious code. The update methods modify internal state safely, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of online statistical functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
