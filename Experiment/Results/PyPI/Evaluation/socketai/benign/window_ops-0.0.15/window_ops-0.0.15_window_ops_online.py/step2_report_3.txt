  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code defines classes for online and seasonal calculations, reading data from arrays and new points.\n- **Sinks:** Correct; no external output or system calls.\n- **Flows:** Correct; data flows internally, no external side effects.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 — appropriate, as no security issues are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to Report 1.\n- **Sinks:** Correct; no external data transmission.\n- **Flows:** Correct; internal computations only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard implementation, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; consistent with previous reports.\n- **Sinks:** No external data handling.\n- **Flows:** Data flows internally.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard statistical classes, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** No external output.\n- **Flows:** Internal data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clear, standard implementation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** No external side effects.\n- **Flows:** Internal, straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, safe implementation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the absence of security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of online statistical methods, with no malicious or security concerns.",
