  "purpose": "The function removes a specified prefix from a given string if present.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 's' and 'prefix' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the function returns a modified string based on input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the conditional check and string slicing, with no external output or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple string utility function that checks if a string starts with a given prefix and removes it if so. It performs a standard operation using 'startswith' and string slicing, with no dynamic code execution, external data access, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, clean, and adheres to expected behavior for such a utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a standard string manipulation task without any malicious intent or security risks.",
