  "purpose": "Utility function to remove a specified prefix from a string if present.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 's' and 'prefix', string methods 'startswith' and slicing.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external data sinks or leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 's' and 'prefix' flow into 'startswith' check, then to slicing or return.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward string utility that checks if 's' starts with 'prefix' and removes it if so. It uses standard string methods and slicing, with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, and no suspicious behavior is observed. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
