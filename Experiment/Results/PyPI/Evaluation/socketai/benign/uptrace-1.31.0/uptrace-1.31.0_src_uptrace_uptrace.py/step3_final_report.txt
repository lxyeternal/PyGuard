  "purpose": "Configures OpenTelemetry for telemetry data export to Uptrace, including traces, metrics, and logs, based on environment variables and parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (UPTRACE_DISABLED, UPTRACE_DSN), function parameters (dsn, service_name, etc.), placeholder token in Client initialization.",
  "sinks": "DSN parsing and client configuration, telemetry data sent via Client.trace_url, report_exception, and the configured exporters.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and function arguments feed into DSN parsing and resource setup; the Client object handles data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder token '<token>' indicating incomplete configuration; reliance on environment variables is standard but could be misused if misconfigured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward telemetry setup for OpenTelemetry, with proper error handling, resource creation, and environment variable controls. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is detected. The placeholder token is a benign indicator of incomplete configuration, not malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate telemetry configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The placeholder token and environment variable reliance are standard practices and do not constitute security threats. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
