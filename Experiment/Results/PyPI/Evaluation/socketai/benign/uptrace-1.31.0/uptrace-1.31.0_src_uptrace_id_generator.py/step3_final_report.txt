  "purpose": "Generate unique span and trace IDs for distributed tracing using non-cryptographic randomness and current time.",
  "sources": "random.getrandbits(64) for span ID; time.time() in nanoseconds plus random.getrandbits(64) for trace ID",
  "sinks": "None; code does not write to external systems or leak data",
  "flows": "generate_span_id() uses random.getrandbits; generate_trace_id() combines timestamp and random bits",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.getrandbits() instead of cryptographically secure RNG; timestamp-based trace ID could be predictable in theory",
  "analysis": "The code overrides ID generation methods, producing IDs based on non-secure randomness and current time. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The use of random.getrandbits() is standard for non-security-critical IDs like tracing identifiers, though it is predictable and not suitable for cryptographic purposes. No external data, network activity, or secrets involved. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are appropriate, reflecting minor predictability concerns but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious implementation of an ID generator for tracing purposes. The only caveat is the use of non-cryptographic randomness, which is acceptable in this context. No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities; the scores are justified and consistent.",
