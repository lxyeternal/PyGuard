  "purpose": "Custom implementation of an ID generator for tracing spans and traces, likely for distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Import of random module, import of time module, method calls to random.getrandbits and time.time",
  "sinks": "Return values of generate_span_id and generate_trace_id functions, which produce IDs for traces and spans",
  "flows": "random.getrandbits and time.time provide input for ID generation, which is returned as IDs for tracing",
  "anomalies": "Use of random number generator for trace IDs instead of cryptographically secure methods; simple timestamp used for high bits of trace ID",
  "analysis": "The code redefines methods to generate trace and span IDs. It uses 'random.getrandbits' for both span and low parts of trace IDs, which is acceptable for non-cryptographic purposes but not for security-sensitive contexts. The trace ID combines current timestamp (high bits) with a random low part, which may reduce uniqueness over a very high volume of traces but is generally acceptable for distributed tracing. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a custom ID generator for tracing, using standard modules and methods. Although it employs non-cryptographically secure randomness for trace IDs, this is typical for tracing IDs and not inherently malicious. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on this code alone.",
