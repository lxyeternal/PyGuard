  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard telemetry setup with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk is due to network transmission of trace data with headers containing sensitive info, but this is typical for such systems. The scores are appropriately low, and no modifications are necessary."
