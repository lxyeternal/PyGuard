  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external file without validation, which can execute malicious code if the file is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code reads 'version.py' and executes its content via exec(), which is inherently risky if the file is malicious or compromised. No other suspicious behaviors such as network activity or obfuscation are present. The pattern is common for dynamic version retrieval but introduces security risks. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.3-0.4) are appropriate, though the risk could be slightly higher if the environment is untrusted. The main concern is the potential for executing malicious code in 'version.py'. Safer alternatives include importing the version module directly or parsing the version string explicitly. The code itself is straightforward and lacks malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is standard but risky due to the use of exec() on an external file. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary security concern is the potential execution of malicious code if 'version.py' is compromised. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a moderate risk score around 0.3-0.4. To improve security, replacing exec() with safer import methods is recommended.",
