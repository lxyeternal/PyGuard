  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings Across Reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code reads a `version.py` file and executes its content via `exec()` to retrieve version information.\n- The primary concern is the security risk introduced by using `exec()` on an external file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with.\n- None of the reports identify actual malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation in the code itself.\n- The confidence levels are generally high (0.7–0.8), reflecting a consensus on the security concern regarding `exec()`.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no evidence of malicious intent or malware.\n- The security risk scores are moderate (~0.2–0.4), acknowledging the potential danger of executing untrusted code but noting that the code itself is standard for dynamic version loading.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, and the only notable issue is the use of `exec()`, which is correctly identified as a security concern.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** No logical errors are present; the analysis correctly emphasizes the security implications of `exec()`.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2–0.4) are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Recommendations and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher than 0.2, perhaps around 0.3–0.4, is justified because executing external code always carries some risk, especially if the file can be modified by an attacker.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**        | **0**             | No evidence of malicious code or activity.                                                    |\n| **Obfuscated**     | **0**             | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation detected.                                                |\n| **Risk**           | **0.3**           | Moderate risk due to use of `exec()` on external file; depends on trustworthiness of `version.py`. |\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The main security concern is the use of `exec()`. To mitigate this, replacing `exec()` with safer alternatives (e.g., importing the version module directly or parsing the file content) is advisable.\n- The reports correctly identify the potential for malicious code execution but do not find evidence that such malicious code exists.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
