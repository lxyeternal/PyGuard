  "flows": "Reading version.py -> Executing its content -> Passing version to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a file read from disk, which can execute arbitrary code if the file content is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code opens a version.py file, executes its content via exec() to extract version information, and then passes this version to setuptools.setup(). The use of exec() on external files can be risky because if the version.py file is maliciously modified, it could execute harmful code during setup. However, there are no other suspicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The main concern is the potential for executing malicious code embedded in the version.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally standard for dynamic version loading but relies on exec() with an external file, which can pose security risks if the file is compromised. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware, but the exec() usage should be noted as a security concern.",
