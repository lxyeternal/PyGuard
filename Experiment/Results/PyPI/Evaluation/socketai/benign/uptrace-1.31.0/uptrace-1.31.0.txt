      "conclusion": "The code pattern is standard but risky due to the use of exec() on an external file. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary security concern is the potential execution of malicious code if 'version.py' is compromised. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a moderate risk score around 0.3-0.4. To improve security, replacing exec() with safer import methods is recommended."
