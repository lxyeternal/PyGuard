  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports functions and variables from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- There are no data flows, network operations, or untrusted input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign and standard for a package initializer.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n- The security risk score is also 0 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Risk score considerations:**\n- The risk score is uniformly 0 across reports, which is reasonable. The code does not perform any actions that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- Since no untrusted data, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n**Potential issues or points of critique:**\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough in their reasoning, correctly identifying that the code is a benign module initializer.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they correctly note the absence of suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes to the scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is a standard, benign package initializer with no security concerns.",
