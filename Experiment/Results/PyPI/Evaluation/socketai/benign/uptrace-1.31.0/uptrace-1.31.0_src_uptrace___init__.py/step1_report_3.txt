{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an initializer for an OpenTelemetry exporter for Uptrace, importing functions and variables for configuration and reporting.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.dsn, .uptrace, .version) and the __all__ list defining public API.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, network calls, or sensitive data processing is visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or processing logic in this code; it only imports and exports functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports functions and variables from local files to define the public API for an OpenTelemetry exporter. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute any code beyond imports. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. It appears to be a standard package initializer without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes imports and exports for the package.",
