  "purpose": "Module initializer for the Uptrace OpenTelemetry exporter, importing functions and variables for export.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.dsn, .uptrace, .version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module setup, importing functions and variables from local modules and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no data processing, network operations, or input handling. The code's simplicity and structure are typical for a package initializer, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign intent, and the code does not process untrusted input or perform any external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious or security concerns. All signals and scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with its benign nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
