  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for Uptrace exporter functions for OpenTelemetry, including configuration, flushing, reporting exceptions, shutdown, and trace URL management.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .dsn, .uptrace, .version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only imports and exposes functions and variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only organizes imports and exports functions/variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and __all__ definitions to expose module functionalities. It imports functions related to configuring and managing OpenTelemetry tracing from local modules and defines the public API. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations in this snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are apparent. The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup that exposes certain functions and variables. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign package initialization snippet with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
