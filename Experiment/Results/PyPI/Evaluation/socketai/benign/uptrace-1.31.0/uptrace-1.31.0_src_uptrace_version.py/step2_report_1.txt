  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors involved. The code is static and minimal.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   No report finds any anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or code execution, nor does it include any suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores Consistency & Justification**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is consistent; there's no indication of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as expected, since there's no security concern with simply defining a version string.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly concluding that this code is benign.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code's static nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**:  \n   Given the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I agree with their assessments. The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or security implications.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: No further action is needed; the code is safe and standard.",
