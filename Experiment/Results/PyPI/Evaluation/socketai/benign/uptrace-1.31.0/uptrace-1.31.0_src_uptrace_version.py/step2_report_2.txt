  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no external inputs, data flows, or outputs.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices for version declaration.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - None of the reports find any issues, anomalies, or malicious activity.\n   - The code does not interact with external data, files, network, or perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - The consistency across reports is good.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations**:\n   - Since the code is trivial, any suspicion would be unwarranted unless additional context or code snippets are provided.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are made, only the declaration of a version string.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- Given the reports' unanimity and correctness, no change in scoring or analysis is necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The current scoring and conclusions are accurate.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the actual code content.",
