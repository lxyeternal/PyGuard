  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "None; static assignment, no data flow or external input",
  "flows": "None; static code with no data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; simple static assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence scores of 1. There are no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity. No modifications are necessary.",
