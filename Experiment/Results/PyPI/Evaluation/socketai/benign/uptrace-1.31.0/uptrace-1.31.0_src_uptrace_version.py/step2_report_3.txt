  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no external inputs, data flows, network calls, or dynamic code execution. This is a standard practice in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity or Obfuscation**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs, and no signs of malicious intent. The code is minimal and serves solely to declare a version number.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nThere are no logical errors or flaws in the code. It performs a single, well-understood task.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** consistently 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0, aligned with the absence of any malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** consistently 0, since there's no vulnerability or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Assessment of Risk Scores**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and benign nature, the scores are reasonable and appropriate. There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent that are unsupported by the code content.\n\n6. **Overall Justification**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Remain at 0, as the code poses no security threat.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is typical for Python packages and is not a vector for any security issues.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version declaration, and the scores assigned in all reports are justified and appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
