{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'uptrace' library, verifying configuration, URL generation, and DSN parsing.",
  "sources": "Controlled test inputs within functions, including hardcoded DSN strings and span objects.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and logging; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke 'uptrace' methods with controlled data; no external or untrusted data flows into critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing without network calls, secrets, or malicious patterns. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed in a way that could lead to security issues. The code's purpose is to verify expected behaviors of the 'uptrace' library, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite for 'uptrace' with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
