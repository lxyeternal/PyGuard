{
  "purpose": "Parse and represent a Data Source Name (DSN) URL for configuration purposes, providing properties for related endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'dsn' in the parse_dsn function, URL components extracted via urlparse.",
  "sinks": "Potentially uses untrusted data from 'dsn' for parsing and property access, but no sensitive sinks like file I/O or network connections are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input 'dsn' -> urlparse -> DSN object properties and methods, which generate endpoint URLs based on input data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation. The default grpc_port is hardcoded but benign. No suspicious data flows or anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL parsing to extract components like scheme, hostname, port, and username (used as token). It validates presence of scheme and host, remaps certain hostnames, and constructs endpoint URLs based on conditions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling detected. The logic is straightforward and consistent with typical DSN parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard DSN parser with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles input carefully, validates essential components, and constructs endpoint URLs securely. No malware or security threats identified.",
