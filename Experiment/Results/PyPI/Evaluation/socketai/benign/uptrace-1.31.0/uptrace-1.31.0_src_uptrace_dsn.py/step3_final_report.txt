  "purpose": "Parse and validate DSN URLs, extract components, and generate endpoint URLs with special handling for certain hostnames.",
  "sources": "Input DSN string, URL query parameters, URL hostname, URL username (token)",
  "sinks": "Generated site_url, otlp_http_endpoint, otlp_grpc_endpoint properties",
  "flows": "Input DSN string -> urlparse -> extract scheme, host, port, username, query -> process hostname and query -> construct URLs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard URL parsing, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL parsing with validation for scheme and host, remaps specific hostnames, and constructs URLs based on extracted components. It extracts a token from the URL's username, which is typical for DSNs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The default grpc_port is set to '14317', which is benign. The code's logic is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard DSN parser with no malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is typical for URL parsing utilities. All reports accurately assess the code's benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
