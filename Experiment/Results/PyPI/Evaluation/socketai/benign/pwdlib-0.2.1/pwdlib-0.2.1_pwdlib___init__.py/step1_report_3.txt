{
  "purpose": "Provide a modern password hashing functionality through the PasswordHash class.",
  "sources": "Importing PasswordHash from a local module '_hash'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code simply imports and exposes a class.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of implementation details; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with versioning information and exports a PasswordHash class from a local module. There are no dynamic executions, external network calls, or suspicious logic. The absence of implementation details limits deep analysis, but based on the visible code, no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for password hashing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and focused solely on providing a hashing class.",
