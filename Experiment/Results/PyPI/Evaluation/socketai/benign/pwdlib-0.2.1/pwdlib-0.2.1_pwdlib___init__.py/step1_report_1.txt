{
  "purpose": "Provides a modern password hashing functionality by importing a PasswordHash class from a local module.",
  "sources": "The module imports PasswordHash from a local file '_hash'. No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or output data anywhere.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is minimal, defining version and exposing a class. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization, setting version info and importing a class responsible for password hashing. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious constructs. The presence of a local import from '_hash' indicates modular design, typical for cryptographic utilities. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a benign, standard module setup for password hashing functionality, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
