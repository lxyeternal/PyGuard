  "purpose": "Module initializer exposing PasswordHash class from local _hash module",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._hash and version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import of PasswordHash from _hash; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal and straightforward code, no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py, importing a class and setting version info. No dynamic code, input/output, or suspicious patterns are present. The actual security depends on _hash implementation, but this snippet alone shows no malicious or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and structure.",
