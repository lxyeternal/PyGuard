  "purpose": "To provide a modern password hashing utility in Python by exposing the PasswordHash class.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing PasswordHash from a local module '_hash'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines module metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears minimal, straightforward, and typical for a Python package __init__.py. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, imports a class from a local module, and defines __all__ for export. No external data reading, no sinks handling untrusted input. The imported class and version string are standard for a package's __init__.py. No malicious behavior detected; the code is typical for a library entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package initializer that exposes password hashing functionality. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified.",
