{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a Python package module related to password hashing, providing version information and exposing a PasswordHash class for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports the PasswordHash class from a relative module '_hash'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The package exposes the PasswordHash class to external modules, which could be used for password hashing functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only versioning, import, and export statements. No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials or dynamic execution, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a package's version, importing a class, and exposing it. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or obfuscation. Since only the package's interface code is provided, and the actual implementation resides in '_hash', there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior here. The simplicity and transparency suggest a legitimate package structure.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code alone, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears to be a standard password hashing utility with no suspicious activity evident.",
