  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \n   The provided code defines three custom exception classes:\n   - `PwdlibError`: Base class for password library errors.\n   - `HasherNotAvailable`: Raised when a specified hash algorithm isn't available.\n   - `UnknownHashError`: Raised when a hash can't be identified.\n\n   All classes construct error messages using internal variables and call the superclass constructor. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or data processing. The code is straightforward and purely for error handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or code injection.\n   - Error messages are standard and do not leak sensitive information.\n   - No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security risk score:** 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Analysis of Each Report**  \n   All reports are consistent, emphasizing that the code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns. They correctly identify that the code is solely for error handling, with no external data or network interactions.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Overestimations**  \n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.  \n   - No adjustments needed for scores; they are reasonable and justified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Final Scores**  \n   Based on the code and reports:\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for a password hashing library. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action or concern is necessary.",
