  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, with constructors that set message attributes and call the superclass constructor.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or data leaks are present.\n   - The message strings are constructed from internal variables and static text, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no data flows or external interactions.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious behavior.\n   - No external inputs, outputs, or data processing that could be exploited.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the current evaluations and reflects the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes for a password hashing library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
