{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a password hashing library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; error messages are generated from internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; exceptions are for internal error reporting.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data to external systems; error messages are constructed from internal variables only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. It initializes error messages with string formatting based on internal variables like 'hasher' and 'hash'. No external inputs, network operations, or data processing occurs. The structure is straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for error handling within a password library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions.",
