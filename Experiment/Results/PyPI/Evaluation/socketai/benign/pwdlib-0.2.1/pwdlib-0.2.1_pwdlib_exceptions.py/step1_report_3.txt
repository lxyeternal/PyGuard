{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to password hashing library operations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class initialization parameters are used for error messages.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction and raising exceptions; no data is sent to external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (hasher, hash) flow into exception messages during object instantiation, but are only used internally for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Error messages are straightforward and informational.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class. These classes are used to signal specific error conditions related to unavailable hash algorithms and unidentified hashes. All parameters are used solely for message construction, with no external data access, network operations, or insecure practices observed. The structure and logic are typical for exception handling modules and contain no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard implementation of custom error classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely for error handling within a password library context.",
