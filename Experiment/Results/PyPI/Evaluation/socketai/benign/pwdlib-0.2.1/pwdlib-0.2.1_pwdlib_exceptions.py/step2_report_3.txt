  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the corresponding code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes: `PwdlibError`, `HasherNotAvailable`, and `UnknownHashError`.\n   - All classes inherit from `Exception` (via `PwdlibError`) and primarily set message attributes for error reporting.\n   - No external data input, network operations, or data leaks are present.\n   - The message strings are constructed from internal variables and static text.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code is benign and only for error handling is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly identified as absent.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted input or perform external calls.\n   - The message strings are constructed from safe variables.\n   - No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are present.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims about Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The error messages are informative but not exploitable.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a password hashing library.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The error handling is straightforward, with no external data or network interactions.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores are appropriate, and there is no need for adjustments.",
