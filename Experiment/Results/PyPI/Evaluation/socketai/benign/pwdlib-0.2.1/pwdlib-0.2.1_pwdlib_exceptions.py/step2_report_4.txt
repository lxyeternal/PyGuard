  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes:\n     - `PwdlibError` (base class)\n     - `HasherNotAvailable` (indicates a hash algorithm isn't available)\n     - `UnknownHashError` (indicates a hash couldn't be identified)\n   - Each class constructor sets relevant attributes and constructs an error message, then calls `super().__init__(message)`.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external input handling, network operations, or data processing.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n2. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, straightforward, and contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They note the absence of external data sources, sinks, or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code does not introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The code only raises exceptions with informative messages; no code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n   - The messages suggest user guidance but do not contain any malicious content.\n   - No external dependencies or inputs are involved that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - The reports are accurate in their evaluation.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following estimated scores:\n     - **Malware:** 0.0\n     - **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n     - **Risk:** 0.0\n   - These reflect the benign, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exceptions for a password hashing library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores provided are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
