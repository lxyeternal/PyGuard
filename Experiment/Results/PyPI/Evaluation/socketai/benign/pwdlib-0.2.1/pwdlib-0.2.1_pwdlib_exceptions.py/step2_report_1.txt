  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is solely defining custom exception classes for a password hashing library.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- Error messages are constructed from internal variables.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The error messages are descriptive and intended for user guidance.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The exception classes inherit from a base error class, which is typical.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, also appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0, aligns with the benign nature.\n- Confidence: 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is whether the error messages could leak sensitive information. However, since the messages only include the 'hasher' name or 'hash' value, and these are likely non-sensitive identifiers or hashes, this is acceptable.\n- The messages do not include any user data or secrets, so no privacy concerns are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or security-threatening elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Final note:**\n- No changes needed; the code is safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
