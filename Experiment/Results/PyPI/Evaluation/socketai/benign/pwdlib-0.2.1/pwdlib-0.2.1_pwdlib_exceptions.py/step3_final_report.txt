  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a password hashing library to handle specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "Internal variables such as 'hasher' and 'hash' used to construct error messages.",
  "sinks": "Error messages output via exception raising; no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with internal data leading to message construction and raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and solely for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class, with constructors setting attributes and creating messages from internal variables. No external data handling, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The messages are non-sensitive and serve user guidance. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exceptions for a password library. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
