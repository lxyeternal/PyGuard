  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions related to password hashing errors in a Python library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since the code only defines classes and error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists of standard exception class definitions with no unusual constructs or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, used for handling specific error cases in a password hashing library. All messages are static or constructed from safe, limited variables (like hasher names or hash values). There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external calls that could be exploited. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and well-structured for error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
