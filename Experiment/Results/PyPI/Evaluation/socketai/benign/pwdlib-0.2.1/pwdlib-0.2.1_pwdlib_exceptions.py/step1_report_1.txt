{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to password hashing library operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class and method definitions with internal string handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data processing or output occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; error messages are constructed from internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, with constructors setting message attributes and calling super().__init__. There are no external input handling, network operations, or data leaks. The message construction uses internal variables and standard string formatting. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are evident. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a password library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
