{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a password hashing library, primarily for error handling related to unavailable hash algorithms and unidentified hashes.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions and exception messages. No data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or output channels that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines static classes and error messages without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard exception patterns with descriptive messages.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from a base error, with detailed messages guiding the user to fix issues such as missing hashers or unidentified hashes. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious activity, or suspicious behavior. The class design and implementation appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of custom exception definitions for a Python library managing password hashing. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No security concerns are present.",
