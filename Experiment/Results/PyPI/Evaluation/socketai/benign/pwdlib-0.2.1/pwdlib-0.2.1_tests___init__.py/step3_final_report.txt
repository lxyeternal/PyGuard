  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external modules, network or file operations, dynamic code execution points like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, command execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env) to sinks (network, file, exec), possibly via dynamic code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution (eval/exec), obfuscation, suspicious data flows, unusual imports, or code patterns indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is not provided; analysis relies on described patterns. Reports 1-3 indicate no suspicious activity, with low malware and obfuscation scores, high confidence. Report 4 suggests potential malicious patterns like environment variable reading, dynamic execution, and data transmission, leading to moderate malware (0.3), obfuscation (0.4), and high security risk (0.65). The absence of concrete code warrants conservative scores. Report 5 is empty, indicating no risk. Given the descriptions, suspicion in Report 4 is moderate; if actual code confirms eval/exec or data exfiltration, malware score should be higher. Overall, scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning, with slight adjustments recommended if code evidence is available.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with appropriate low scores; Report 4 shows moderate suspicion based on described patterns. Without actual code, assessments are cautious. If dynamic or malicious code is confirmed, malware and risk scores should be increased accordingly. Current scores are reasonable and aligned with the provided descriptions.",
