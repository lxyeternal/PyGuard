  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task, but due to lack of context, it is unclear whether it is benign or malicious.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, or external data files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, system commands, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and may reach sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are evident. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from input sources, processes it, and then potentially sends data over the network or writes to files. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system modifications are detected. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation observed. Without more context or specific code snippets, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to perform its intended functions without malicious intent.",
