{
  "purpose": "The code exports an interface or protocol called HasherProtocol from a local module named base.",
  "sources": "The code imports HasherProtocol from a relative module (.base).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident; the code simply imports and exports a symbol.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs. It appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a relative module and exports it via __all__, which is common for defining module interface. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as network activity, data leaks, or code injection. It’s a simple module setup for exposing HasherProtocol.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard, benign module declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
