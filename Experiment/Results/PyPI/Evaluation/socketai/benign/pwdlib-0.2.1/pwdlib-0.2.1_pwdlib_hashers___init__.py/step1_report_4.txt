{
  "purpose": "The code exports a protocol class 'HasherProtocol' for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.base' to import 'HasherProtocol'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or sensitive data; simply defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class 'HasherProtocol' from a local module '.base' and exposes it via __all__. It appears to be part of a larger project, likely defining an interface or protocol. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations present. The code structure is simple and typical for Python modules that organize exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a module export, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on its content.",
