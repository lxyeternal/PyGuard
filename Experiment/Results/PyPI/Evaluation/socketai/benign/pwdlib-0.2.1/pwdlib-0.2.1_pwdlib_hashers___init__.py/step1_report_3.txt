  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a protocol named HasherProtocol from a relative module, then explicitly exports it via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code structure is straightforward and typical for defining module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a simple purpose of defining and exporting a protocol interface. No malicious or security-related concerns are identified based on this minimal snippet.",
