  "purpose": "Exports the HasherProtocol class from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .base module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; import and export only",
  "anomalies": "None; standard module pattern with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a class and exposes it via __all__. It contains no logic, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify the low risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module declaration with no malicious or security-sensitive elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
