{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. There is no clear indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules (e.g., reading files or network responses).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file writes, network communications, or database interactions, if present, but none are evident in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and potentially to output sinks, but no explicit malicious flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is plain and structured with typical Python syntax. No unusual features, obfuscated constructs, or risky behaviors are present. It does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. Without additional context or hidden code, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose with no suspicious elements.",
