  "purpose": "The code is intended to perform data processing, input reading, or environment querying, typical of benign Python scripts or packages.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external data sources, or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment modifications, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It reads input and environment data, with no evidence of malicious payloads or suspicious network activity. Confidence is moderate (0.6), given limited context. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The data flow is typical, and no anomalies are observed. The overall security risk is low (0.2), consistent with benign code. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
