It relies on reputable cryptographic practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score of approximately 0.1 reflects the inherent minimal risk in password hashing code relying on external libraries."

If dynamic or malicious code is confirmed, malware and risk scores should be increased accordingly. Current scores are reasonable and aligned with the provided descriptions."
