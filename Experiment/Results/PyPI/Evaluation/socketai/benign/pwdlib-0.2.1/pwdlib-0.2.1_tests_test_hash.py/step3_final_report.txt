  "purpose": "A test suite validating password hashing, verification, and hash updating using Argon2 and bcrypt libraries.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded passwords and hashes within test functions and fixtures.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; all operations are internal, involving only in-memory data and library functions.",
  "flows": "Input passwords flow into hashing and verification functions; hashes are compared internally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard testing practices and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for password hashing and verification, employing well-known libraries and static test data. It performs no network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All signals point to benign testing behavior. The use of hardcoded secrets is typical in test environments and does not indicate malicious intent. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for password hashing libraries, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1) due to test data. These scores are consistent with the analysis and should be maintained.",
