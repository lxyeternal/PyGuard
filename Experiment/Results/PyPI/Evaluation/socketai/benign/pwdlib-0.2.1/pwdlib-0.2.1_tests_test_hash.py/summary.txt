  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for password hashing libraries, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1) due to test data. These scores are consistent with the analysis and should be maintained."
