  "purpose": "A password hashing utility that uses pluggable hashers to hash and verify passwords, with support for recommended default hasher (Argon2).",
  "sources": "Input passwords, optional salt parameter, hash strings for verification, hash strings for identify() method.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Password input -> hasher.hash() or hasher.verify() -> output hash or boolean; identify() used to select hasher.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard password hashing utility relying on external hashers implementing a known interface. It performs hashing, verification, and optional rehashing. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The reliance on external hashers is typical but depends on their security. No obfuscation or code anomalies are detected. The exception handling for unknown hashes is appropriate. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to best practices for password security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-implemented, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of external hashers. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero dependency risk.",
