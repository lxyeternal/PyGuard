  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-implemented, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of external hashers. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero dependency risk."
