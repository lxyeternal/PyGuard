{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility class for hashing and verifying passwords using configurable hashers, primarily intended for secure password management.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided passwords for hashing and verification, and hashed passwords for verification.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs hashed passwords and verification results. It does not directly write data externally or access untrusted input streams.",
  "flows": "Password input flows into hash() and verify() methods; hashed data flows out from hash(), and verification results flow out from verify() and verify_and_update().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard practices for password hashing.",
  "analysis": "The class facilitates password hashing using hashers, with a recommended default (Argon2). It includes methods for hashing, verifying, and updating hashes, relying on external hasher implementations. No malicious code, external network access, or suspicious data handling is present. The code appears to be a standard, secure password utility with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical password hashing utility focused on security and modularity. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws based on the provided code. It appears safe for use, assuming the external hashers are implemented securely.",
