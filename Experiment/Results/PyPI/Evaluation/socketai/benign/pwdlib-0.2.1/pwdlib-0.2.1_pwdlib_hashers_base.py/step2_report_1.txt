  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code review:**\n\n- The code defines utility functions `ensure_str` and `ensure_bytes` for handling string/bytes conversions, which are standard and appear correct.\n- The `HasherProtocol` is a typing.Protocol defining an interface for hashers, with methods `identify`, `hash`, `verify`, and `check_needs_rehash`. The method signatures look appropriate.\n- No actual implementation is provided, only an interface.\n\n**2. Report content:**\n\n- All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no additional details.\n- No raw responses are provided.\n\n**3. Confirming issues in the code:**\n\n- The code itself appears syntactically correct.\n- The `HasherProtocol` is a standard way to define a protocol/interface in Python typing.\n- No obvious vulnerabilities or flaws are evident in the code snippet.\n\n**4. Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n\n- Since the reports contain no details beyond \"Empty response,\" there's no evidence of logical errors or vulnerabilities in the report data.\n- The code is minimal and safe, with no embedded malicious behavior.\n\n**5. Scores and their justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity is suggested or evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — No obfuscation present; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — Without any detailed reports or code issues, the risk appears negligible.\n\n**6. Potential issues based on assumptions:**\n\n- The reports do not provide enough information to assume any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- Empty responses could suggest a problem with report collection, not an actual issue in the code.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n\n- Given the lack of evidence, the scores should remain at zero or near zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the available information, the code appears secure and free of issues. The reports do not provide any actionable details, so no concerns or higher scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future reports include detailed responses indicating vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
