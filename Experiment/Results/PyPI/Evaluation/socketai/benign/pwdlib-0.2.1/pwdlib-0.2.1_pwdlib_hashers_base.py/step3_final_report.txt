  "purpose": "Defines utility functions for string/bytes conversion and a protocol interface for hashing implementations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to ensure_str and ensure_bytes functions, class method signatures in HasherProtocol",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Input data to conversion functions; protocol methods outline expected behavior but contain no implementation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for encoding conversions and a protocol for hashers, with no embedded malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are empty, indicating no identified issues. The code is syntactically correct, uses standard patterns, and lacks any obfuscation or malicious constructs. Given the absence of detailed findings, the likelihood of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
