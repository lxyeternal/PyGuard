  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no additional details. Since the raw_response is empty, there is no specific claim or identified vulnerability to verify. The code itself appears syntactically correct and implements common utility functions and a protocol interface for hashing.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports contain no content to analyze; they are placeholders or incomplete.\n- No actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are described or evidenced.\n- The absence of details makes it impossible to confirm or deny any specific problem.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- Since no issues are described, assigning any scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) would be speculative.\n- The report's scores are not provided, but the lack of information suggests they should be minimal or zero.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Without any evidence or description of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation, assigning a high risk score is unjustified.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- No claims are made; the reports are empty.\n- Any assumptions about vulnerabilities would be unfounded.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure scores are consistent with the report**\n\n- Since no issues are reported, the scores should be zero or near-zero.\n- The malware score should be zero, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should also be zero, given the straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or claimed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no identified vulnerabilities or issues)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code itself is clean, standard, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n- The empty reports suggest either incomplete reporting or lack of issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or risk. All scores should be zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware Score   | 0               |\n| Obfuscated Score| 0               |\n| Risk Score      | 0               |\n\nPlease ensure future reports include detailed findings for more precise analysis.",
