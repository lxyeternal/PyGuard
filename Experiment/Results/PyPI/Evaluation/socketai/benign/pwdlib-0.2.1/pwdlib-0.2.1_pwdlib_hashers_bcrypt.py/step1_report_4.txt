{
  "purpose": "The code implements a bcrypt-based hashing and verification system for passwords, including identifying, hashing, and rehashing checks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user-provided passwords and hashes for verification, and optional salt inputs for hashing.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with bcrypt library functions that generate hashes and verify passwords. No data leaks or external data transmissions are observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as passwords and salts flow into bcrypt functions for hashing and verification; hash format is matched via regex for identification and rehash checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; the regex strictly matches bcrypt hash formats. The code dynamically imports bcrypt only if available. No suspicious code structures or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles password hashing and verification using bcrypt. It uses a regex to identify bcrypt hashes, which is standard. It dynamically imports bcrypt and raises a custom exception if unavailable. The salt generation and hashing follow bcrypt standards. No malicious behavior or backdoors are apparent. The salt and rounds are configurable. No data leaks, code injection, or suspicious network activity are present. The only potential concern is the reliance on the bcrypt library's security, but it is a widely used and vetted package. Overall, the code appears legitimate with no security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of bcrypt password hashing and verification with proper format checks. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a secure, well-structured, and straightforward implementation.",
