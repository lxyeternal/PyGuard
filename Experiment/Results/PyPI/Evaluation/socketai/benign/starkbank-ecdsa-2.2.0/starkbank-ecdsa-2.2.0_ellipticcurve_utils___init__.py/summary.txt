  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent, correctly indicating low risk and no malicious behavior. The main adjustment needed is to assign a risk score of 0 for reports with missing or empty code snippets, rather than high scores like 1. The overall threat level remains very low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a conservative risk estimate around 0.1–0.2."
