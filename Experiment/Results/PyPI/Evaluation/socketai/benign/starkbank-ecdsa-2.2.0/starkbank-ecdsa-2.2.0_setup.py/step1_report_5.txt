{
  "purpose": "Configure the packaging setup for the 'starkbank-ecdsa' Python library, including metadata and instructions for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no user input or external data processing within the code",
  "flows": "N/A, the code is static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries 'os.path' and 'setuptools' for package setup. It reads a README.md file to include as long_description, which is a common practice. The setup() function contains static package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, keywords, and description. No code execution, user input handling, or external data processing occurs. The commented instructions for building and uploading the package are standard and do not execute automatically.\nOverall, this is typical setup code for packaging a Python project, with no indications of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any malicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The package appears to be legitimate and safe based on this analysis.",
