  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'starkbank-ecdsa', including metadata and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; no other external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily reads a file and sets up package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The commented instructions for packaging and uploading are standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os.path' and 'setuptools' to configure package metadata. It reads the README.md file for the long description. The 'setup()' function specifies package details, author info, license, and URL. There are no dynamic code executions, external data inputs, or suspicious code constructs. Comments instruct on building and uploading the package, which are standard in setup scripts. No embedded malicious code or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and typical for Python projects.",
