{
  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'starkbank-ecdsa' Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the script mainly performs setup tasks.",
  "flows": "Reads file content and passes static metadata to the setup() function, with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. Comments provide instructions for distribution but no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules os.path and setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description. The setup() function is used with static, hardcoded package metadata such as name, version, author, and URL. There are no inputs from external sources at runtime, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. Comments offer guidance on package creation and upload, which are standard practices. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious code or suspicious behavior, solely defining package metadata and instructions for distribution.",
