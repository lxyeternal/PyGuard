  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, defining metadata and instructions for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks capable of causing data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from file read to setup configuration; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
