{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'starkbank-ecdsa' for distribution via PyPI, including metadata and configuration for packaging.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; package metadata fields such as name, url, author, email, keywords, version.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or user input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs static configuration and file reading without data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules os.path and setuptools for package configuration. It reads a README.md file for long description, then calls setup() with package metadata including name, description, URL, author info, keywords, and version. The comments provide instructions for building and uploading the package but do not execute any code. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code appears to be standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script used for package distribution. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no embedded backdoors, and no data leakage mechanisms. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
