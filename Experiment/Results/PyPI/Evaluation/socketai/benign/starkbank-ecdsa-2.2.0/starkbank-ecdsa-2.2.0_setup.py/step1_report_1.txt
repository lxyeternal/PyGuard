  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'starkbank-ecdsa' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; no network or sensitive data operations.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file (source) during setup (no sensitive or untrusted data flow), with no other data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script structure, no code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads a README.md file for long description and defines package metadata for distribution. No user input, environment variables, or external data processing occurs at runtime. The code utilizes standard setup tools without any dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The comments guide package creation and upload processes but do not influence runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks detected.",
