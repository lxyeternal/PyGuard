  "purpose": "This code provides elliptic curve cryptographic operations such as point addition, multiplication, and modular square root calculations, likely intended for cryptographic protocols.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are points (p, q, and their components) passed as parameters to the functions. No external data reads or untrusted input sources are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be mathematical operations and point calculations, but they are standard cryptographic computations without direct data leaks or malicious actions. No network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve point conversions and calculations within the elliptic curve domain, with no external data flow to untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard elliptic curve arithmetic with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The module defines cryptographic functions for elliptic curve operations, including modular inverse, point addition, doubling, and scalar multiplication. All functions use mathematical formulas typical for elliptic curve cryptography. No external inputs or network calls are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns identified. The functions seem to perform standard cryptographic calculations safely, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of elliptic curve cryptography operations without malicious intent or security issues. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It is a straightforward cryptographic utility module.",
