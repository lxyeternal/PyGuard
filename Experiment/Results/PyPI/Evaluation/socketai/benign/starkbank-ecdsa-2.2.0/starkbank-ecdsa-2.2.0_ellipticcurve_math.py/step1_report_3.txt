  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical operations for elliptic curve cryptography, including point addition, multiplication, and conversions between coordinate systems.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are primarily the Point objects and method parameters such as p.x, p.y, p.z, and method inputs like value, prime, n, N, A, P.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external files, send data over the network, or interact with system resources; it performs in-memory calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input points and parameters flow through mathematical functions for point addition, doubling, scalar multiplication, and coordinate conversion, with no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual control flow is observed. The functions perform standard elliptic curve operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines elliptic curve operations such as point addition, doubling, scalar multiplication, and coordinate transformations using Jacobian coordinates. These functions rely solely on mathematical calculations involving inputs like points and curve parameters. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The methods are standard implementations of elliptic curve algorithms without signs of malicious behavior. No backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious external interactions are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility for elliptic curve calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of elliptic curve math functions used in cryptography. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. No security risks are evident beyond the inherent mathematical complexity and potential cryptographic vulnerabilities if used improperly, but such issues are outside this code's scope. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
