{
  "purpose": "This code provides mathematical operations for elliptic curve cryptography, including point addition, multiplication, and conversion between coordinate systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'p', 'q', 'x', 'n', 'A', 'P', 'prime', and 'value'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident data sinks that send data over the network, write to files, or access system resources; all operations are purely mathematical.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into mathematical functions, including 'modularSquareRoot', 'multiply', 'add', and 'inv', with internal conversions between coordinate systems; no external data or untrusted sources are used beyond method parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard elliptic curve math functions with proper use of modular arithmetic; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements elliptic curve point operations, including point addition, doubling, scalar multiplication, and coordinate conversions. These are standard cryptographic primitives. All functions utilize only inputs provided as parameters and perform mathematical calculations without external side effects or network operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical implementation of elliptic curve math, with no signs of malicious intent or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard mathematical implementation for elliptic curve cryptography and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The code appears safe and intended for cryptographic operations.",
