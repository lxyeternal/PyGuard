  "purpose": "Implement elliptic curve cryptography operations including point addition, doubling, scalar multiplication, and coordinate conversions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as points (p, q), scalars (n), and curve parameters (A, P, N).",
  "sinks": "Internal mathematical calculations; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input points and parameters flow through ECC functions, resulting in new Point objects representing combined or scaled points.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ECC algorithms with clear structure and comments. No external data sources or malicious behaviors are present. The functions perform cryptographic math on provided parameters, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The modular inverse and coordinate conversion functions are standard. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident. The code's correctness depends on proper parameter selection outside this snippet, but the implementation itself is sound.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of elliptic curve cryptography functions with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
