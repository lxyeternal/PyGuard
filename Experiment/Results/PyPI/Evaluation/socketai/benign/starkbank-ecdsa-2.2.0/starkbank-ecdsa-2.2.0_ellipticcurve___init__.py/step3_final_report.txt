{
  "purpose": "This code imports various cryptography-related modules, likely setting up dependencies for a cryptographic library or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: .utils.compatibility, .privateKey, .publicKey, .signature, .utils.file, .ecdsa",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A — only import statements, no data or control flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal cryptography modules, with no executable code, data processing, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The absence of active code or data flows indicates a benign setup phase. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern given the limited scope. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements. The high confidence (around 0.9) in benignity is justified by the simplicity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, consisting solely of module imports for a cryptography library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
