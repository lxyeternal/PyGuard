  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of ECDSA with no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws. The minor risk score accounts for potential issues with nonce randomness if the utility function is not cryptographically secure. Overall, the implementation appears safe and trustworthy."
