  "purpose": "Implementation of ECDSA signing and verification routines for elliptic curve cryptography.",
  "sources": "Hashing the message with sha256, generating nonce via RandomInteger.between, elliptic curve point multiplication and addition, modular inverse calculations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Message hashed -> nonce generated -> elliptic curve point multiplication -> signature components (r, s) computed -> verification involves elliptic curve point operations and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation; reliance on RandomInteger.between assumes cryptographically secure randomness.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ECDSA routines with proper use of cryptographic primitives. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The use of RandomInteger.between for nonce generation is acceptable if cryptographically secure; otherwise, it could be a concern. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with best practices. The reports uniformly agree on the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and significant security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting low residual risk primarily related to the randomness source.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of ECDSA with no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws. The minor risk score accounts for potential issues with nonce randomness if the utility function is not cryptographically secure. Overall, the implementation appears safe and trustworthy.",
