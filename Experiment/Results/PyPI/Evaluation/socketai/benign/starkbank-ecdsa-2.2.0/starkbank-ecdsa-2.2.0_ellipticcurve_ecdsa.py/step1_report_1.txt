  "sources": "Hashing message with hashfunc, generating random number with RandomInteger.between, reading message input, accessing curve parameters, and signature parameters.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical operations involving curve points, signature validation, and random number generation, which could affect cryptographic security if compromised.",
  "flows": "Message input -> Hashing (hashfunc) -> Conversion to number (numberFromByteString) -> Random number generation -> Elliptic curve point multiplication -> Signature creation and verification steps involving curve parameters and point calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of RandomInteger.between for nonce generation, which appears standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; no obfuscation; standard cryptographic operations. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ECDSA signing and verification routines using elliptic curve cryptography. It relies on provided curve parameters, performs proper nonce generation with RandomInteger, and uses typical mathematical operations. No anomalies or malicious behaviors such as hidden backdoors, malicious data leaks, or network activity are present. The usage appears legitimate and aligns with standard cryptographic practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of ECDSA cryptography, with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. It appears to perform legitimate cryptographic functions without any suspicious behavior.",
