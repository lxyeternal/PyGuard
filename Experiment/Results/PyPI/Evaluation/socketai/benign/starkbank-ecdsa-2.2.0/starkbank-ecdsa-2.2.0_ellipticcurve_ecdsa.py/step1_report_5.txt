  "purpose": "Implementation of ECDSA signature generation and verification functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: message, privateKey, publicKey, signature; Data from hash functions; RandomInteger.between for nonce generation.",
  "sinks": "Math.multiply, Math.inv for cryptographic calculations; returns Signature object.",
  "flows": "Message is hashed -> numberFromByteString converts hash -> nonce generated via RandomInteger -> cryptographic point computations -> Signature returned; During verification, hash processed -> cryptographic operations performed to verify signature.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Use of cryptographic primitives appears standard. Random number generation for nonce is appropriate for cryptographic purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ECDSA signing and verification routines, using secure cryptographic methods and proper random nonce generation. No data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are present. The flow from input to output follows typical cryptographic operations. The code relies on external cryptographic primitives and utility functions but does not perform any unusual or potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of ECDSA algorithms with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses proper cryptographic practices and does not contain any malicious code or backdoors.",
