  "purpose": "Implementation of ECDSA signing and verification for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Input data: message, signature, privateKey, publicKey; Data reading occurs during hashing and key access.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic calculations, random number generation for signing, mathematical operations on curve points.",
  "flows": "Input message → hash (hashfunc) → numberFromByteString → signing computations; signature verification → hash (hashfunc) → numberFromByteString → mathematical checks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of RandomInteger.between for cryptographic randomness; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard cryptographic flow; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ECDSA signing and verification. Randomness is derived from a cryptographically appropriate function, and the cryptographic operations follow standard protocols. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation, malicious data handling, or hidden code is detected. The use of RandomInteger.between appears appropriate for generating nonces in cryptographic operations. All operations appear consistent with secure ECDSA implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard, legitimate ECDSA cryptographic procedures with no evident malicious intent. It does not contain suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Overall, it appears to be a standard cryptographic implementation.",
