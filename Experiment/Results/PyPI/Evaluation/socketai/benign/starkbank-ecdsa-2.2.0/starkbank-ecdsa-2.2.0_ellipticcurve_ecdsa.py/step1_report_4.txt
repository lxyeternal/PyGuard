  "purpose": "Implementation of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for signing and verifying messages.",
  "sources": "Reads message input, privateKey and publicKey objects, hash function, random number generator, and cryptographic curve parameters.",
  "sinks": "Performs cryptographic operations involving private keys, cryptographic points, and signature parameters; no direct data leaks or network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Message is hashed (source) -> used in signature generation or verification -> cryptographic calculations involving private/public keys and signature parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no hidden network activity or data exfiltration identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ECDSA signing and verification functions, utilizing cryptographic primitives and random number generation. It uses secure hash functions and elliptic curve math functions. No indicators of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The random number generator usage appears typical for cryptographic purposes. The code structure and variable usage are straightforward and align with standard cryptographic implementations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic implementation of ECDSA with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard cryptographic operations securely without hidden or malicious features.",
