  "purpose": "Implement ECDSA signature generation and verification for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Hashing of message using hashfunc, RandomInteger.between, input parameters like message, privateKey, publicKey, signature.",
  "sinks": "Math.multiply, Math.inv, comparison checks, return statements, potential use of untrusted data in cryptographic calculations.",
  "flows": "Hash message -> convert to number -> generate random integer -> compute point on elliptic curve -> derive signature (r, s) -> verify signature by elliptic curve calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) signing and verification. It uses a secure hashing function, secure random number generation within the curve order, and standard elliptic curve point multiplication. No suspicious data flows, external network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscation or hidden logic detected. The code appears to be a typical implementation of ECDSA without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code implements standard cryptographic procedures for ECDSA signing and verification without evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility.",
