  "purpose": "Cryptographic signature class for encoding and decoding signatures in DER and Base64 formats.",
  "sources": "Input data from byteStringFromHex, hexFromByteString, base64FromByteString, and external parse functions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally for serialization/deserialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input byte strings through parsing and encoding functions, resulting in DER or Base64 representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward cryptographic data handling with standard functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Signature class with methods for converting signature components to DER and Base64 formats and vice versa. It relies on external encoding/decoding functions that are typical for cryptographic data processing. No network, file I/O, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. External functions are assumed benign, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic signature handler with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
