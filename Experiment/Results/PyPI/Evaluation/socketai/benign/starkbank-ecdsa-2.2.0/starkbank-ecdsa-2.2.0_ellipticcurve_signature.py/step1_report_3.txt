{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for handling digital signatures, including encoding and decoding signatures in DER and Base64 formats, likely for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input parameters for methods such as 'fromDer' and 'fromBase64', which accept external byte strings or encoded data for signature reconstruction.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the output methods 'toDer' and 'toBase64', which generate encoded signature data; no untrusted data is sent externally without encoding.",
  "flows": "Input data (signature components or encoded strings) flows through decoding methods to internal representation, then can be re-encoded for transmission or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations are present. The code performs standard encoding/decoding routines with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard cryptographic signature class, with methods for converting between formats. It does not include network operations, file I/O, or any external data leakage points. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of signature serialization/deserialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard cryptographic utility for handling signatures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious activities, or security risks within this fragment. It appears safe and well-structured.",
