  "purpose": "Define a Signature class for cryptographic signature handling, including serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'string' parameters in fromDer and fromBase64 methods, as well as class attributes r, s, recoveryId.",
  "sinks": "Methods convert data to byte strings, hex strings, and base64, primarily for serialization. No untrusted external sink or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Input data (hex/base64) flows into decoding functions, which produce signature components (r, s). These components are then encoded for output or reconstructed from encoded data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. Use of cryptographic encoding/decoding appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cryptographic Signature class with methods for converting signatures to and from DER and Base64 formats. It uses standard encoding/decoding functions imported from other modules. No suspicious code paths, external network access, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The operations are typical for cryptographic serialization/deserialization. The only data handling involves transforming cryptographic signature components between different formats, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement standard cryptographic signature serialization/deserialization functions without any malicious intent or security risks. It processes data in a typical manner for such cryptographic operations.",
