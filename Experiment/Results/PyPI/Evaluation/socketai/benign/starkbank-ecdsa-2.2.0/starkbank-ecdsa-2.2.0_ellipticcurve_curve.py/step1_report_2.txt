  "purpose": "This code defines elliptic curve parameters and associated functions for cryptographic operations, specifically for secp256k1 and prime256v1 curves, used in ECC cryptography.",
  "sources": "Reads static parameters defining elliptic curves, including curve coefficients, prime modulus, generator points, and OID identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Uses mathematical functions for modular arithmetic and square root calculations; no direct sinks for untrusted data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Defines curve parameters (sources) and stores/retrieves curves from a dictionary by OID (flows). No external untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Uses standard mathematical operations and curve definitions. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements elliptic curve cryptography parameters, with functions to verify point containment and compute y-coordinates on the curve. The curve definitions and OID management are straightforward and consistent with standard ECC implementations. No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns detected. The code does not include any network operations, data leaks, or reverse shell activities. It primarily provides mathematical structures and lookup functions for known ECC curves.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of elliptic curve parameters for cryptographic use. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code functions as intended for secure elliptic curve cryptography.",
