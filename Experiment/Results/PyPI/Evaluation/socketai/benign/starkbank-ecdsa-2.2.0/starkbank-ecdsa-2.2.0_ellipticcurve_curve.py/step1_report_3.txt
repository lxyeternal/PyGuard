{
  "purpose": "Define elliptic curve parameters and related operations for cryptographic computations, such as point validation and curve retrieval by OID.",
  "sources": "Input data includes curve parameters during object initialization, OID inputs for curve retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no external data or untrusted input handling beyond parameter passing and retrieval functions.",
  "flows": "Curve parameter initialization -> storage in global dictionaries -> retrieval via getByOid function.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard elliptic curve operations and data; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden functionality detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an elliptic curve class with methods for point validation and computing y-coordinates from x, based on modular square roots. Curves such as secp256k1 and prime256v1 are instantiated with known parameters. The global registry stores curves by OID for later retrieval. No user input or external data processing occurs, and no suspicious functions or code patterns are present. No malicious or backdoor behavior is apparent. The code appears to be standard cryptographic parameter definitions and retrieval logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard elliptic curve cryptography setup with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations for curve validation and lookup. No anomalies, malware, or obfuscation are detected.",
