  "purpose": "Defines elliptic curves with parameters, validation, and retrieval functions for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded curve parameters, input points for validation and calculations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data processing; internal computations only.",
  "flows": "Input points are validated; y-coordinate computed from x; no external data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; standard cryptographic setup.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard elliptic curve parameters (secp256k1 and prime256v1) with functions for point validation and y-coordinate calculation. All parameters are fixed and well-known, with no dynamic or external data influence. The functions perform straightforward mathematical operations, and no obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The use of Math.modularSquareRoot is typical for ECC point calculations. The curve registry is static, and retrieval by OID is direct. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-understood implementation of elliptic curve cryptography parameters and operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the risk score appropriately reflects the standard cryptographic setup.",
