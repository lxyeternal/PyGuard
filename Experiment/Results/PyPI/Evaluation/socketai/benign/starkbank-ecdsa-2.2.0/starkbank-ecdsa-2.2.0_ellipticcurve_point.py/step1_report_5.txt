  "purpose": "Defines a simple Point class with coordinate attributes and string representation.",
  "sources": "Input data: None (class definition only).",
  "sinks": "Output: __str__ method generates a string representation of the point.",
  "flows": "No external data flows or untrusted input sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Point class with an __init__ method initializing coordinates, a __str__ method for formatting output, and an isAtInfinity method that checks if y==0. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. The methods perform straightforward attribute assignments and comparisons. The class is self-contained, with no external dependencies or input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign class definition for representing points in space. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as a simple data container with no harmful or suspicious operations.",
