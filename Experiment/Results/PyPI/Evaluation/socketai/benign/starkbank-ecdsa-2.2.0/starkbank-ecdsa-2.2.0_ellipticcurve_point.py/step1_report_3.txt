{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple Point class for 3D coordinates with basic methods.",
  "sources": "Initialization of attributes (x, y, z), string representation, and isAtInfinity method.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic Point class with an initializer, string method, and a simple check method. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, and no code execution based on untrusted data. The methods perform straightforward attribute assignments and comparisons. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a Point class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
