{
  "purpose": "The code manages elliptic curve private keys, including generation, serialization (DER, PEM), deserialization, and public key derivation, following cryptographic standards.",
  "sources": "Input data includes secret key hex strings, DER-encoded byte strings, and PEM-formatted strings; external modules provide cryptographic functions and encoding utilities.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if private key material or public key strings are mishandled or exposed; validation ensures consistency but does not involve external sinks.",
  "flows": "Secret is generated or loaded -> serialized to DER/PEM -> deserialized and validated -> public key derived -> output as string or PEM.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows are present; validation checks are standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard elliptic curve key management with proper validation and encoding. External dependencies are typical cryptographic utilities. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. Validation steps confirm key integrity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of elliptic curve private key handling, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
