{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment variable checks related to Docker health checks and port mappings, then makes an HTTP request to verify accessibility.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ; URL constructed from these variables; urlopen used for network request.",
  "sinks": "Network request to constructed URL; potential data leakage if environment variables are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence URL construction, which leads to network request execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; straightforward health check pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Docker health check script verifying environment variables and performing an HTTP GET request. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The network request depends on environment variables, which could be manipulated in untrusted environments, but this is typical for such scripts. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk due to environment variable reliance. The code's behavior is benign and aligns with standard health check practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing environment validation and health check network requests without malicious intent. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1-0.2. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
