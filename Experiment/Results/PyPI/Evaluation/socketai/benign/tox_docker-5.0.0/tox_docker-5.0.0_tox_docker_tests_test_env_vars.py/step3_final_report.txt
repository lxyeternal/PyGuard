  "purpose": "Unit tests for functions that transform container environment variable names and port mappings, verifying string manipulation logic.",
  "sources": "Static string inputs within test functions, no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by utility functions to generate environment variable names and port identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward testing of string transformation functions with static inputs, involving no external data, network, or system modifications. The functions are imported, and their internal logic isn't shown, but their usage appears benign. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The tests serve to verify correct string formatting for container configuration, with no malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for container configuration utilities. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
