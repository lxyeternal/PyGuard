  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent. All malware scores are correctly set to 0, obfuscation scores to 0, and security risk scores are slightly conservative at 0.2, which is reasonable given the benign assessments. Minor adjustment could be lowering risk scores to 0.1 for more precision, but current scores are justified. Overall, the evaluations are sound and well-justified."
