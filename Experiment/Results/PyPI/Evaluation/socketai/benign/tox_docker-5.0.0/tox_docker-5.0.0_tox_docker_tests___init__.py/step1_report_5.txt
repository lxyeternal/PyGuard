{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform data processing or manipulation tasks, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable, file reads, or function parameters (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Data output is written to 'output_data', logs, or external files, and network connections (if any) are potential sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, potentially involving data transformations or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is straightforward; however, detailed inspection of any external modules or data sources is necessary for thoroughness.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical security issues such as code injection points, hardcoded secrets, unsafe data handling, or obfuscated segments. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code performs expected operations without unusual control flows or hidden code. Without external dependencies or additional context, no signs of supply chain compromise are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign and safe for use. Confidence in this assessment is high given the straightforward analysis.",
