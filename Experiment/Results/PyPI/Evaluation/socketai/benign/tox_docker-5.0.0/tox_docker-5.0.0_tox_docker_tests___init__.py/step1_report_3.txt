{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; there are no apparent reads from external input, files, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code seems to perform internal computations without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features are detected. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed for common security issues including external data sources, unsafe data handling, or malicious patterns. It appears benign with standard functionality. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are evident. The code structure and style are consistent with normal Python scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The script seems to be a routine Python program without security concerns.",
