  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external data fetches, files, parameters, network connections, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file writes, system commands, environment variables, logs.",
  "flows": "Data from sources to sinks, including external data handling and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or benign code with no malicious indicators. The low malware scores (0) are justified by the lack of suspicious activity. Security risk scores of 0.2 are conservative but acceptable, reflecting minimal potential concern. Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), consistent with the thorough reasoning. No obfuscation detected in any case. The analysis aligns with the evidence, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are accurate and consistent. All malware scores are correctly set to 0, obfuscation scores to 0, and security risk scores are slightly conservative at 0.2, which is reasonable given the benign assessments. Minor adjustment could be lowering risk scores to 0.1 for more precision, but current scores are justified. Overall, the evaluations are sound and well-justified.",
