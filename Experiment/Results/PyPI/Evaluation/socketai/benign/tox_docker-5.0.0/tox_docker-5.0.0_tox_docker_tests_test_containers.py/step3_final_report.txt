{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions that verify container properties such as IDs, images, and naming conventions using find_container().",
  "sources": "find_container() calls retrieving container metadata, container attributes like 'Image' and 'name'.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on container IDs, names, and attributes; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Source: find_container() outputs; Sink: assertions checking container properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward container property assertions without external data manipulation, network activity, or obfuscation. It is typical test code verifying container uniqueness and naming conventions. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard container management test suite with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.05, reflecting minimal concern due to its benign nature.",
