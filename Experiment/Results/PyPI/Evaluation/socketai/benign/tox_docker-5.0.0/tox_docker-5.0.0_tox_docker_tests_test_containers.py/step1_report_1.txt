{
  "purpose": "The code is for testing container management functions, specifically to verify container identification and naming conventions.",
  "sources": "The code reads container identifiers and attributes via the find_container function and container object properties.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data; no output or external data manipulation is observed.",
  "flows": "Input from find_container → container object properties → assertions; no external data flows or untrusted data usage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward test logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function to locate containers and performs assertions to verify container IDs are unique and container names follow a pattern. There is no evidence of malicious activities, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The code is typical for testing containerized environments and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard test suite for container management and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
