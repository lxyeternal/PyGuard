{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the pygal package, importing various chart types, maps, and plugins, and sets up dynamic plugin loading for map modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements, entry points for plugins, and attribute access in module and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "Module attribute setting, dynamic module loading via sys.modules, and adding to sys.meta_path.",
  "flows": "Imports and plugin loading sources flow into module attribute assignments, which can then be accessed via the package; plugin modules loaded into sys.modules; sys.meta_path entry point interacts with module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic plugin loading via importlib_metadata entry points and sys.meta_path manipulations is unusual but legitimate for plugin architecture. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or hidden backdoors are present. The code is primarily for plugin management and module loading.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a plugin architecture for pygal maps via importlib_metadata entry points and custom sys.meta_path loader. It includes exception handling during plugin load, warns on failures, and dynamically adds plugins to the maps namespace. The code structure is standard for plugin systems, with no signs of malicious behavior. It does not perform any data exfiltration, command execution, or network connections. The dynamic import mechanisms are typical for extensible systems. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader for pygal map modules with safe practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet. It serves as a plugin management system and does not contain malicious or harmful code.",
