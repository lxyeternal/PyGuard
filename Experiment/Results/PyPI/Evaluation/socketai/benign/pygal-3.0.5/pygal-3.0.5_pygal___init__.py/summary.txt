  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, well-structured plugin loader for pygal, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins, which is outside the scope of this code review. Scores are appropriately set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2-0.3, considering the inherent risks of plugin systems."
