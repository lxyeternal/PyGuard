  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides statistical functions for inverse error function, PPF, and confidence intervals, sourcing data from function parameters, standard library, and optional scipy.\n\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code uses standard mathematical formulas and handles missing dependencies gracefully.\n\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The report concludes the code is benign, with a confidence of 1.0, malware score 0, and security risk 0. The reasoning appears sound.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is straightforward statistical utility code with no malicious or security issues. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with input data including 'x', 'n', estimates, and confidence levels.\n\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior; dynamic import of scipy is standard. The code performs typical statistical calculations.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.2, possibly due to the optional dependency handling, but still reasonable.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2. These seem justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar statistical functions, with input validation and optional scipy import.\n\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Standard mathematical and statistical functions.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1. The low security risk is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general functions, with input validation and optional scipy import.\n\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation. The fallback mechanisms and error handling are standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, with input parameters and optional scipy import.\n\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code performs standard statistical calculations.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion appears justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard statistical utility with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The confidence scores are high, reflecting the certainty of benignity.\n\n- **Security Risks:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to optional dependencies handling, but still low overall.\n\n- **Potential for Malicious Activity:** None detected. The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to optional dependency handling, but generally safe)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a straightforward, well-documented statistical utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the detailed review, I concur with the existing assessments. The code is benign, and the security risk is minimal.",
