  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, performing standard statistical calculations with no suspicious behavior. The use of external libraries (scipy) is optional and well-handled.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, obfuscated 0, malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard practices, fallback mechanisms, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but still very benign. The security risk is minimal, likely due to optional dependencies or potential misuses, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard statistical functions, proper validation, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior assessments; benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard implementation, no malicious patterns, proper handling of optional dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard statistical functions, no suspicious behavior, proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation. The functions are mathematical/statistical, with no suspicious side effects.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly due to optional dependencies and standard mathematical functions. No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the context, I would assign a **0.1** to **0.2** maximum, reflecting minimal risk due to dependency handling but no actual security issues.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a typical statistical utility module.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.\n- The use of fallback methods and input validation indicates good practices.\n- The security risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1, considering the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1**\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign nature of the code and the detailed reasoning provided in the reports.",
