  "purpose": "Provides statistical functions for inverse error function, PPF, and confidence intervals, used in statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (x, n, sample estimates), optional import of scipy.stats, internal calculations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through mathematical functions; optional scipy import influences which statistical functions are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; fallback implementation for erfinv is standard; no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical formulas with proper input validation and optional dependency handling. The use of a custom approximation for erfinv is mathematically sound. The optional import of scipy.stats is handled gracefully, with fallback to custom functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions perform calculations typical for statistical analysis, and the code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical utility module with no malicious intent or security issues. The minimal security risk stems from optional dependency handling, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is benign, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
