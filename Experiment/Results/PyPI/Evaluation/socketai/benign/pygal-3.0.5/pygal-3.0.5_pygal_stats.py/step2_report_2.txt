  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states the code provides straightforward statistical functions with no suspicious behavior. The code uses standard math functions, optional scipy import, and no obfuscation or malicious code. The analysis aligns with the code content.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0. This seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the use of standard practices, optional scipy import, and no malicious activity. The only concern is a security risk score of 0.2, perhaps due to the optional import pattern or the potential for misuse if scipy is compromised.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2. These seem reasonable, given the optional dependency handling.\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.2 is justified but not high. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the code is standard statistical functions, with proper error handling and no suspicious behavior. The fallback to custom approximation for erfinv is mathematically sound, and the scipy import is optional.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1. These are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern, standard statistical functions, no malicious code, proper handling of dependencies.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2. These are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the code is a straightforward statistical utility with optional scipy dependency, no obfuscation, no malicious code, and proper validation.\n\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1. These seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0 across the board.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to optional dependency handling, which is standard practice but could, in theory, be exploited if scipy were compromised. Still, the risk is minimal.\n\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (mostly 0.9-1.0), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to optional dependencies, which is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified based on the code review. No adjustments necessary.",
