  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides statistical functions, no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- **Analysis:** The functions are standard mathematical implementations; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1.0, malware 0, security risk 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully benign, accurate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the optional scipy import, standard calculations, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** The fallback mechanism for scipy is standard; no suspicious code patterns.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.  \n**Note:** The security risk is slightly elevated (0.2), possibly due to the optional dependency handling, but no actual malicious behavior is present.\n- **Justification:** The code's reliance on external libraries and fallback is typical; no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score seems slightly high but acceptable given the dependency handling, which could be exploited in other contexts. Malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard statistical functions, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard statistical functions, no malicious activity, proper validation.\n- **Analysis:** The code's structure and fallback mechanisms are typical.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard functions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code is purely statistical with no network, file, or data exfiltration, malware should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign **0**, as the code is straightforward and well-documented.\n- **Risk Scores:** The risk scores are generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. Since the code is purely mathematical and relies on standard libraries, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- The only slight concern is the optional import of `scipy.stats`, which could, in theory, be exploited if malicious code were injected into the environment or if the dependency was compromised. However, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The approximation of `erfinv` is standard, and the fallback for scipy is a common pattern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation**\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, primarily due to dependency handling, which is standard practice)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a legitimate statistical utility module, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The dependency handling is typical, and the calculations are standard. The low security risk score is justified, but it could be marginally increased if considering dependency-related attack vectors, which are outside the scope of this code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The overall malware and obfuscation scores should remain at **0**, with a very low risk score (~0.1–0.2). The current scores are reasonable and reflect the benign nature of the code.",
