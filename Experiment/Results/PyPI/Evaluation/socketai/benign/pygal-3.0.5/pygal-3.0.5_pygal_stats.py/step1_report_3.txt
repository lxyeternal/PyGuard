{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for calculating inverse error functions, percent point functions, and confidence intervals for continuous and dichotomous data, primarily used for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'x', 'n', 'point_estimate', 'stddev', 'sample_size', 'confidence', and optional keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that could leak data or perform dangerous actions. It mainly performs calculations and may raise exceptions for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through mathematical computations, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External library usage (scipy) is optional and clearly documented. The code performs standard statistical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for statistical calculations, including approximation of the inverse error function, percentile point functions using scipy or a fallback method, and confidence interval calculations for continuous and dichotomous data. It includes an import attempt for scipy.stats with a fallback to an error if scipy is not available when needed, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious code, such as network access, data exfiltration, or malicious logic, are present. The code is well-structured, with clear documentation and comments, and does not perform any suspicious actions or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of statistical functions with no malicious intent. It appears to be a utility module for statistical analysis, with proper input validation and no suspicious behaviors.",
