{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for calculating inverse error functions, probability points, and confidence intervals for continuous and dichotomous data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, standard library modules (`math`), and optional `scipy.stats` for statistical calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations and returns numerical confidence intervals; no apparent data sinks are present that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., x, n, confidence levels) flow through mathematical functions, with optional `scipy.stats` functions used for statistical calculations, then produce confidence interval outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code relies on external libraries only for statistical functions, with fallback handling if `scipy` is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for approximating statistical measures like inverse error function and percent point function (PPF). It uses standard mathematical formulas and optional external libraries for statistical distributions. The functions include input validation and handle missing dependencies gracefully. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The calculations are typical for statistical analysis, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward statistical utility module providing functions for calculating confidence intervals and related statistical metrics. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
