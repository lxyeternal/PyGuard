  "purpose": "A CLI utility to generate pygal SVG charts based on user input and configuration.",
  "sources": "User input for chart type, filename, series data, and configuration options via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes SVG output to specified file; no external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "User supplies data and options -> script creates chart object -> adds series -> renders to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. Dynamic attribute access is controlled by trusted pygal API.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line tool that uses standard libraries and trusted APIs. It processes user input to generate SVG charts without executing or injecting code, connecting to networks, or handling secrets. The potential risks involve misuse of SVG content or overwriting files, but these are inherent to charting tools and do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified due to the potential for crafted SVGs, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard CLI utility for generating SVG charts with pygal. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
