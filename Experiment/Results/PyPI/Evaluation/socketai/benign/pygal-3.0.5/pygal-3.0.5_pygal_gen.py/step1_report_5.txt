  "purpose": "Generate a customizable SVG chart using the pygal library based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed by argparse; pygal configuration items.",
  "sinks": "chart.render_to_file() which writes SVG output to a file specified by user.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argparse parsing -> pygal chart creation -> render_to_file() writes SVG to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of standard libraries and pygal's configuration items appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to parse user inputs for chart type, output filename, series data, and various pygal configuration options. It dynamically adds command-line options based on pygal.config.CONFIG_ITEMS, which is typical for customizable CLI tools. The series data are converted to floats and added to the chart. The chart is rendered to a file specified by the user. No network connections, no code injection, no suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard libraries and pygal's API. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI utility for generating SVG charts using pygal. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with a standard chart-generation tool, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
