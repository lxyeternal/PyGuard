      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with minimal security concern. The only potential risk stems from executing external code via exec(), which is standard in such scripts. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is low, and the code is safe for use in a controlled environment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of mathematical interpolation routines with no malicious or security concerns. The low security risk scores are justified as conservative caution but do not reflect actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for open-source use."

The main concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins, which is outside the scope of this code review. Scores are appropriately set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2-0.3, considering the inherent risks of plugin systems."
