  "purpose": "Utility functions for color manipulation, including color space conversions, parsing CSS color strings, and adjusting color properties.",
  "sources": "No direct data sources or external input sources are evident in the code; functions operate on parameters passed to them.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions process data internally without writing to external systems or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No external data flow paths; functions convert and manipulate color data within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or hidden data flows observed. The code performs standard color conversion and adjustment operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for color conversions (RGB to HSL and vice versa), parsing various CSS color formats, and adjusting color properties such as hue, saturation, and lightness. All functions operate on parameters and return processed values; there are no external data inputs or outputs indicative of malicious activity. No network operations, file I/O, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions rely solely on mathematical operations for color transformations. There is no obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The use of assertions and assertions-based conversions appear safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for color processing with no indications of malicious intent or supply chain security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured color manipulation module with no suspicious behavior.",
