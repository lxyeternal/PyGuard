  "purpose": "Utility functions for color manipulation and conversion, used by the pygal library for generating parametric styles.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as color strings and numerical parameters within functions like parse_color, normalize_float, rgb_to_hsl, hsl_to_rgb, adjust, rotate, saturate, desaturate, lighten, darken.",
  "sinks": "Return values of color conversion functions, and the output of functions that generate CSS color strings (unparse_color). No data flows to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input color strings are parsed, converted, adjusted, and then reconstructed into CSS color strings. The flow is primarily internal, from input parsing to output formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations are present. The code strictly performs color space conversions and manipulations. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides color conversion and adjustment utilities with functions for RGB-HSL transformations, parsing various CSS color formats, and adjusting hue, saturation, and lightness. All functions are deterministic and focused on color calculations. There are no network operations, file I/O, or system modifications. No obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no hidden behavior are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of color manipulation algorithms, consistent with an open-source library's utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured color utility module for the pygal library. It contains no malicious behavior or malicious intent. The functions serve purely computational purposes related to color conversions and adjustments. No security risks or malware indications are identified.",
