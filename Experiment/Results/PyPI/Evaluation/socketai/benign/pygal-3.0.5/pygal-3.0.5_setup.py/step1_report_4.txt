  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the pygal package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from __about__.py and README file; importing os, setuptools; executing __about__.py contents.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data or external input used in vulnerable ways.",
  "flows": "Reading metadata from files, executing a local file to load package info, and passing static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. Use of exec() on a local file (__about__.py) is standard for dynamic metadata loading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that gathers metadata, dependencies, and configuration for packaging. It reads metadata from a local __about__.py file and the README, then invokes setup() with static and dynamic data. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved. The exec() call is used to load package info, which is typical in setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
