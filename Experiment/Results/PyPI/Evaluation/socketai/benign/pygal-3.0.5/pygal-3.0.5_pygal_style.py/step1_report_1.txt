  "purpose": "Defines various styling classes and color schemes for chart visualization in the pygal library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, itertools.chain, and pygal modules. No external input data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into system effects or leaks; functions mainly generate CSS and style configurations.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily handles static style definitions and color manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard style management for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises style classes and color schemes with no user input handling or network operations. It updates style attributes, manages color sets, and generates CSS strings for visualization. No malicious or maliciously crafted behaviors are apparent. The code is well-structured and does not include any suspicious or anomalous code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard style and color management module for a charting library. It contains no malicious, backdoor, or sabotage elements. It is safe and intended for styling purposes only.",
