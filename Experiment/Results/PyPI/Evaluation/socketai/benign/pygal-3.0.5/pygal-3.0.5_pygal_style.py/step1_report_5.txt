{
  "purpose": "This code defines styling classes for a Python SVG graph plotting library, including color schemes and style options.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading functions are present. No user input, environment variables, or network connections are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines classes and constants without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code mainly consists of static class definitions and color manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises class definitions for styling themes, including color palettes and font configurations, with no dynamic data handling or external interactions. The constructor processes font family strings and manages internal font sets but does not perform any network or file I/O. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident. All functions perform straightforward configuration and styling logic. The absence of input/output operations or system commands indicates no malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign styling configuration for a plotting library. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. Its purpose is solely to define visual styles and themes. Overall security risk and malware likelihood are very low.",
