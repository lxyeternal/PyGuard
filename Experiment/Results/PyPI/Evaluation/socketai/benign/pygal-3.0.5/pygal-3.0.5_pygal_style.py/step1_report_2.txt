  "purpose": "Define various styling classes and color schemes for a Python SVG graph plotting library (pygal).",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pygal', class attributes, and methods that generate CSS styles and colors.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to potential data leaks or untrusted data effects; code primarily generates style configurations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only handles style data and color schemes without external data input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of style class definitions with color configurations and font settings. It processes input parameters to generate style dictionaries and CSS color strings. The use of external libraries ('pygal', 'itertools', 'colors') is benign. There are no dynamic executions, external data handling, or code injection points. The code appears to be purely aesthetic and configuration-oriented without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of styling classes for a visualization library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to manage style configurations.",
