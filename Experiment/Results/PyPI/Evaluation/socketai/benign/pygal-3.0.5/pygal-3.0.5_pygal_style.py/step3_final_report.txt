  "purpose": "Defines styling classes, color schemes, font configurations, and CSS string generators for a visualization library (pygal).",
  "sources": "Static class attributes and methods generating CSS strings; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "CSS string outputs; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static style generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of style classes and functions for CSS generation, with no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It is well-structured, static, and configuration-oriented, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for styling purposes, and poses no security risk or malware threat. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, configuration nature.",
