{
  "purpose": "The code provides interpolation functions for plotting graphs, including quadratic, cubic, hermite, lagrange, and trigonometric interpolation methods, used for visual data representation in pygal.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (x, y) and a predefined points list; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external files, send data over networks, execute system commands, or perform any I/O operations involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters (x, y) through interpolation calculations, yielding interpolated points, with no external sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of standard mathematical functions and straightforward interpolation algorithms are noted. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of well-known mathematical interpolation algorithms implemented as Python generators, with standard calculations. It includes a main block demonstrating usage with a plotting library (pygal) and various interpolation options. No code appears malicious or suspicious. No external or network operations, file access, or environment variable manipulations are present. The code is clean, readable, and adheres to common open-source mathematical implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of interpolation functions used for data visualization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for inclusion in projects requiring interpolation capabilities.",
