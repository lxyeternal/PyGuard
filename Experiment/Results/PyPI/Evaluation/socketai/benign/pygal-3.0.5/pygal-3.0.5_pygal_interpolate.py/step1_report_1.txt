{
  "purpose": "The code provides various interpolation functions for graphical data visualization, including quadratic, cubic, Hermite, Lagrange, and trigonometric interpolation methods.",
  "sources": "Data input via function parameters (x and y lists), user-supplied keyword arguments, and internal data structures. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Interpolated data points generated by the yield statements; no sinks that transmit or store untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into interpolation functions; computed points are yielded; the main block demonstrates usage with fixed points and renders a graph in a browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No network operations, file I/O, or environment variable manipulations present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of mathematical interpolation algorithms based on standard Wikipedia algorithms. It performs computations on input lists to generate interpolated points and does not interact with external systems. The main section uses the pygal library to plot the data, but there is no indication of malicious activity. No data leaks, credential handling, or external communications are present. The functions are pure computational routines with no side effects or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of mathematical interpolation methods for data visualization. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain sabotage. The code is safe and focused on data processing for visualization purposes.",
