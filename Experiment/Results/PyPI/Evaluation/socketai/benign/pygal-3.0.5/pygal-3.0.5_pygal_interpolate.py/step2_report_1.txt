  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a collection of mathematical interpolation functions, implemented as Python generators.\n- No external data sources, network operations, file I/O, or environment variable manipulations are present.\n- The code is used in conjunction with the pygal library to produce visualizations.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The main block demonstrates usage with fixed data points, which is typical for such utility modules.\n- The algorithms are standard implementations based on Wikipedia references.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a standard, mathematical implementation with no malicious or suspicious elements. There are no signs of code anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The code appears correct and well-structured for its purpose. No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  - Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable code.\n  - Security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0), reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports justify a high risk score; all are very confident that the code is safe.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports are cautious and base their assessments on the code's content, not assumptions.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are there any hidden risks?**  \n  No. The code performs standard mathematical interpolations.  \n- **Is there any suspicious pattern?**  \n  No.  \n- **Could the code be malicious despite appearances?**  \n  Highly unlikely given the straightforward implementation and lack of external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code is safe, standard, and benign.**  \n- **No signs of supply chain sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.**  \n- **Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**. The code is a straightforward implementation of mathematical interpolation functions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context of deployment and environment, but based solely on the provided code and reports, it is safe.",
