{
  "purpose": "The code provides interpolation functions for plotting graphs, including quadratic, cubic, hermite, lagrange, and trigonometric interpolations, primarily for use in visualizing data points in the pygal library.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (x, y, precision, kwargs), especially the lists of points x and y.",
  "sinks": "Generated interpolation points via 'yield' statements, which output interpolated data points; no sinks involve external data processing or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (x, y) through interpolation algorithms, yielding interpolated points. No external untrusted data source flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of math.sin appears to be for legitimate trigonometric calculations. No obfuscation or hidden code found.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple interpolation functions with standard mathematical algorithms, with no signs of malicious behavior. The functions process data points and generate interpolated points through 'yield', suitable for graph plotting. No network communication, file operations, or external data handling that could be malicious are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and the comments indicate educational or utility purposes. The main block demonstrates usage with plotting, which is typical for such modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of mathematical interpolation functions intended for graph plotting. It contains no malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code appears to be a legitimate, open-source utility without any signs of malware or sabotage.",
