  "purpose": "Mathematical interpolation functions for data visualization, including quadratic, cubic, hermite, lagrange, and trigonometric methods, implemented as Python generators.",
  "sources": "Input data points provided via function parameters; no external data sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "Generated interpolated points yielded for plotting; no external data leaks or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into interpolation functions; interpolated points flow out to visualization tools.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical algorithms based on Wikipedia references, with clear, readable structure. No external system calls, network activity, or file I/O are present. The functions generate interpolated points for visualization purposes. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0-0.1) are consistent with the benign, computational nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of mathematical interpolation routines with no malicious or security concerns. The low security risk scores are justified as conservative caution but do not reflect actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for open-source use.",
