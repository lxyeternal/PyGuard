  "purpose": "Class holding state during rendering, merging configuration dictionaries from a graph object and optional parameters.",
  "sources": "graph.config.__class__.__dict__, graph.config.__dict__, graph.__dict__, kwargs",
  "sinks": "None; in-memory data merging only",
  "flows": "Merging configuration sources into self.__dict__ during class initialization",
  "anomalies": "Multiple merge calls into self.__dict__ could overwrite attributes, but this is standard in configuration merging",
  "analysis": "The code defines a State class that initializes its attributes by merging configuration dictionaries from a graph object and additional keyword arguments using a merge utility. It performs in-memory dictionary merges without executing untrusted code or network activity. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The merging could potentially overwrite attributes, but this is typical for configuration management. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration holder with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and reflect the code's simplicity and safety.",
