  "purpose": "Helper classes for chart projection, bounding, and view transformations in visualization (pygal library).",
  "sources": "No external data input, network activity, or untrusted data processing; uses standard math functions for coordinate calculations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; code performs geometric calculations only.",
  "flows": "N/A – purely computational with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for margins, bounding boxes, and various coordinate projections (linear, polar, logarithmic). It uses standard math functions and exception handling for polar box setup. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Minor coding style issue in ymax setter condition, but it does not impact security. The code's purpose is visualization, and it does not contain malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate visualization utility code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor bug in ymax setter is not security-relevant. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
