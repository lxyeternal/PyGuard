{
  "purpose": "This code provides helper classes for chart projection, bounding, and view transformations, primarily for data visualization in SVG format.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only class constructors and methods that set or compute properties based on parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform network operations; no I/O, external connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows occur internally within methods that perform mathematical transformations of input parameters to projected coordinates, with no external data flow outside the scope of calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is well-structured, uses standard math functions, and performs straightforward geometric computations. No signs of malicious backdoors, hidden data exfiltration, or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for margins, chart bounds, and various projection views (linear, reversed, transposed, polar, logarithmic). It uses standard mathematical operations and properties to perform coordinate transformations. No network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code is evident. The code appears to be purely for visualization purposes without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign helper module for chart rendering with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain backdoors, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activities. Overall, it is a standard visualization utility code with no security concerns.",
