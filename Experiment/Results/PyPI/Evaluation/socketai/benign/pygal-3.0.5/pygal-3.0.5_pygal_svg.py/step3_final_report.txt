  "purpose": "Helper class for generating SVG graphics within the pygal library, handling styles, scripts, and SVG node creation.",
  "sources": "External CSS and JS files loaded via 'file://' URIs, configuration data from the graph object, data series.",
  "sinks": "Embedding CSS/JS into SVG, setting attributes and text in SVG nodes, serializing data into JSON within script tags.",
  "flows": "Reads external files via 'file://', embeds their content into SVG styles/scripts, serializes configuration and data for client-side use.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'file://' URIs for resource loading could be exploited if files are malicious or compromised; no code injection or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SVG helper for pygal, with methods for creating nodes, adding styles and scripts, and rendering SVG. It reads external CSS/JS files via 'file://', which is typical for local resource embedding. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The external resource loading poses a supply chain risk but is not inherently malicious. The code is clear and straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and safe for its purpose. The only potential concern is reliance on external files via 'file://', which should be monitored in secure environments. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
