  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for truncating datetime objects to various time periods such as second, minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, half-year, and year.",
  "sources": "Function calls to truncate() with specific period strings, input parameters to these functions, and internal data structures like PERIODS and ODD_PERIODS.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to external systems, files, or network. No untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause injection or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input datetime objects are processed through various truncate functions which modify their components based on period-specific rules. No external data flow or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward datetime manipulations with well-defined logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of period-based truncation functions for datetime objects. It uses static dictionaries to specify how to reset components for different periods. Functions like truncate_week, truncate_quarter, and truncate_half_year adjust datetime objects to specific period starts. The implementation relies on standard Python datetime operations and is well-structured. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code only manipulates datetime data internally without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for datetime truncation. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The implementation is straightforward, using standard Python practices without obfuscation or malicious patterns. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose a security risk.",
