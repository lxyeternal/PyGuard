{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to truncate datetime objects to various specified time periods such as second, minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter, half-year, and year.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the function parameter 'datetime' in multiple functions like truncate, truncate_week, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The functions take a datetime object, process it internally (mostly by replacing certain fields or calculating offsets), and return a modified datetime object. There are no external data flows or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains straightforward datetime manipulations without any unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or use of dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of utility functions for truncating datetime objects to specific time periods. It uses standard Python datetime operations, such as replace() and timedelta(), with no external calls or user input handling. The functions are well-structured and documented. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, data leakage, or suspicious external communications. The code's sole purpose is date manipulation for likely data processing or analytics tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely utility-based for datetime truncation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The logic is straightforward, and no external dependencies or network operations are involved.",
