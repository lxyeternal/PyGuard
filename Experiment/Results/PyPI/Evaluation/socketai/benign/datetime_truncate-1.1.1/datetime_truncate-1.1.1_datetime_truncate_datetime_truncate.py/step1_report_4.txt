  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to truncate datetime objects to various specified periods (e.g., day, week, month, quarter).",
  "sources": "The code reads datetime objects passed as parameters in various functions such as truncate, truncate_week, truncate_quarter, etc.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output untrusted data, nor does it perform network operations or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Input datetime objects are passed into functions; these functions modify or truncate the datetime objects according to specified rules. No external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The functions perform straightforward datetime manipulations. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides datetime truncation utilities based on standard Python datetime library functions. It uses predefined period mappings and simple replacement operations to truncate datetimes to seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, quarters, half-years, and years. The functions include clear documentation and straightforward logic without any external data sources, network calls, or potential injection points. No anomalies, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for datetime truncation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose without any suspicious or harmful features.",
