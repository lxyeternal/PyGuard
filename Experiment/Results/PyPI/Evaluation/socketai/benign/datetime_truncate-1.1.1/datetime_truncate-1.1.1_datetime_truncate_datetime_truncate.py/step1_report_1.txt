{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to truncate datetime objects to various time periods such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, quarters, half-years, and years.",
  "sources": "The code reads datetime objects passed as parameters to functions like truncate, truncate_week, truncate_quarter, truncate_half_year, and other specific truncate functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or perform any network operations. No sinks related to untrusted data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Datetime objects are passed into various functions which modify and return truncated versions. There are no external or untrusted data flows or injections.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, primarily performing date manipulations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or access to environment variables are used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of functions for truncating datetime objects to specific periods. It uses standard library functions and constants, with clear and explicit logic. The functions are safe, simple, and do not perform any IO, network, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code does not process external input beyond function parameters, and no data leaks or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for datetime truncation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
