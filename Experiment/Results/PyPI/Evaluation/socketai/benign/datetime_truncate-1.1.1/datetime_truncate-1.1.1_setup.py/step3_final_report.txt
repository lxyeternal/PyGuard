  "purpose": "Package setup script for 'datetime_truncate' module, defining metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools.setup' (deprecated but not malicious).",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior. It reads a local README file, defines package metadata, and calls setup functions. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscated code is present. The only anomaly is the use of the older 'distutils' module, which is not inherently risky. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The confidence levels are high, indicating certainty in benign assessment. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, straightforward package configuration file with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The use of 'distutils' is outdated but not harmful. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
