  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'datetime_truncate' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, reads 'README.rst' for long description, and loads package list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input from package metadata and README file; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools.setup', which is less common but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata, data files, and test configurations. It reads the README file for the long description. No external network calls, no input validation, no suspicious code or behavior. The use of 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools.setup' is notable but not inherently malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and solely intended for package configuration and distribution. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
