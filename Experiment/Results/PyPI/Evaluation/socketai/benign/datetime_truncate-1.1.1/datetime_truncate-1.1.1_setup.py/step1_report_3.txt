{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'datetime_truncate' Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description, static package metadata, and package list.",
  "targets": "None of the code directly processes untrusted input or data; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script is static package setup code without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools.setup' (which is generally preferred). Reads 'README.rst' directly without safeguards, but no malicious intent evident. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It imports 'setuptools' but actually uses 'distutils.core.setup' which is unusual but not malicious. It reads a 'README.rst' file to include as long_description, which is a typical pattern. No code execution, data manipulation, or external network activity is present. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a normal package configuration file.",
