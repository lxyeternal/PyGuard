{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'datetime_truncate' Python package, used to define package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description; reads package metadata such as name, version, URL, author, email, etc.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, external commands, or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.rst' to populate long_description during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources or to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools.setup' (less common but not malicious); no other suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It imports 'setuptools' but uses 'distutils.core.setup', which is a typical but less modern approach. It reads a local README file for description, which is standard. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is evident. No obfuscated or unusual code structures are present. No malicious patterns or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard package setup file with no anomalies or security concerns.",
