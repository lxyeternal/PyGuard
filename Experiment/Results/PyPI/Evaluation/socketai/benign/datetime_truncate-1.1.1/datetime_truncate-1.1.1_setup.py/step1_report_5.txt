  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the datetime_truncate Python module",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and distutils.core, reading README.rst file",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present",
  "flows": "Reading README.rst and passing parameters to setup() without processing untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated distutils.core.setup instead of setuptools.setup; no code obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, importing necessary modules and configuring package metadata. No suspicious code, external data processing, or dynamic execution observed. The use of 'open' to read 'README.rst' is typical, though it does not specify safe handling, but this is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, straightforward setup configuration.",
