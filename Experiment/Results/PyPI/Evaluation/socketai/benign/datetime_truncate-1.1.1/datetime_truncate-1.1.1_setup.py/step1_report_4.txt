  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'datetime_truncate' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the script primarily sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Source: open('README.rst').read() -> used in long_description for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' for setup, which is uncommon but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads a README file to include as the long description, specifies package metadata, and defines test requirements. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or anomalies detected. The use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' for setup is unusual but not malicious, and it does not introduce security risks. Overall, the script performs typical package setup operations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
