{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and variables from the module 'datetime_truncate', likely to perform date or time truncation operations.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement importing from '.datetime_truncate', which reads a module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident, as this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import, which can obscure which functions or variables are brought into the namespace but is not inherently malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module. It does not perform any input/output, data processing, or network activity. The use of wildcard import can lead to namespace pollution but is common in package internal code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious intent. The use of wildcard import is a style concern but not a security risk. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
