{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of all symbols from the local module 'datetime_truncate'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are read in this line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the import does not process untrusted data or execute code directly.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution flows in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, but this is a stylistic concern rather than a security anomaly. No malicious or suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of all symbols from 'datetime_truncate'. No code execution, data leaks, or network activity occurs here. The use of 'import *' can hide unwanted functions but is common in internal modules. The security risk is minimal, primarily depending on the trustworthiness of the 'datetime_truncate' module. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are detectable from this snippet alone. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting a very low but non-zero potential risk if the module is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, primarily considering the trustworthiness of the imported module. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security flaws in this code snippet.",
