{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from the module 'datetime_truncate' located in the same package directory.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'datetime_truncate'. No external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are visible in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import which can obscure the actual imported functions or classes, but this alone is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a straightforward import from a local module. It does not contain any complex logic, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. As it is only an import statement, it neither reads input nor writes output, and provides no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The line is a standard import statement importing all contents from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and typical for modular Python projects.",
