{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions, classes, and variables from the module 'datetime_truncate'.",
  "sources": "The source is the imported module 'datetime_truncate'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this snippet; the import itself does not cause data leaks or execute untrusted code directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this minimal import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can be considered suspicious as it may hide malicious or unwanted code, but in this context, it's a common pattern for module imports. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a wildcard import from a local module, which can potentially introduce unwanted functions or variables into the namespace, but on its own, it does not execute any malicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious code or suspicious behavior in this minimal import statement. The code's security risk is low, but the use of 'import *' can sometimes hide malicious payloads if the module is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module, with no evident malicious intent. However, the use of 'import *' warrants caution if the module's integrity is unknown. Overall, the code presents low security risk based on this snippet.",
