  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the snippet:**  \n   All reports are based on the same minimal code:\n   ```python\n   from .datetime_truncate import *\n   ```\n   This is a straightforward import statement, and the code itself is present and consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement from a local module.  \n   - They note the use of `import *` as potentially suspicious but not inherently malicious, which is accurate.  \n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the analysis appropriately considers the limitations of just an import statement.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each report:**  \n   - All reports assign very low security risk (`0.2` or `0`) and malware scores (`0`).  \n   - Confidence levels are high (`0.7` to `1`).  \n   - The reasoning aligns with the scores, given the minimal context.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which seems appropriate given the limited code snippet.  \n   - The code is benign on its own, and the use of `import *` is more of a style concern than a security threat unless the imported module is malicious.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of `0`, which is justified because importing a module does not execute code or perform malicious actions by itself.  \n   - Without additional context or code execution, this score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions or speculation:**  \n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They acknowledge that the actual content of `datetime_truncate` could contain malicious code, but from the import statement alone, there's no evidence.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the minimal, benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed. The code is exactly as shown.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; scores are correctly zero.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present; scores are zero.\n- **Risk level:** Very low, as expected for a simple import statement.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nGiven only this import statement, **the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0**. The use of `import *` is a style concern but does not introduce security risks in itself.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and their reasoning. No additional suspicion or risk is justified based solely on this code snippet.",
