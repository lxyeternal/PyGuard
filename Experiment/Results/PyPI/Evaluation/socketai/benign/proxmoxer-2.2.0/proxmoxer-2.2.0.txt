The use of 'import *' is a common but potentially risky pattern in __init__.py files, but in the absence of evidence of compromise, it does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) due to the import pattern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for file management and integrity verification in a Proxmox environment. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified due to external URL reliance, which is typical for checksum validation. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with best practices."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initializer with metadata and broad imports. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could conceal malicious code in the imported modules. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate risk score reflecting the import pattern. Continuous review of the imported modules is recommended to ensure security."

The low security risk is primarily due to SSL warning suppression, which is a common but potentially insecure practice. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is very strong, with no malicious indicators."
