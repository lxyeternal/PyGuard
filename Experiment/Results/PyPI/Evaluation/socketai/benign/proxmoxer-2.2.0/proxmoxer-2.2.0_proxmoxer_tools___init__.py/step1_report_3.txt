  "purpose": "Module initialization with metadata and importing all submodules",
  "sources": "Module metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__), and import statements",
  "sinks": "Import statements could import code that contains malicious behavior if submodules are malicious",
  "flows": "Metadata variables do not lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities; imports could execute malicious code from submodules",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from . import *' and 'from .files import *' can conceal malicious code within imported modules; no direct malicious code present in this snippet itself",
  "analysis": "The code sets author, copyright, and license information, which is standard. The import statements use wildcard imports, which are risky because they import all symbols from submodules without explicit control, potentially including malicious code. Since the actual content of submodules is not provided, there's a risk that malicious code could be executed upon import. No suspicious or malicious behavior is directly visible in this fragment, but the use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged due to the potential for hidden malicious code within the imported modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and primarily contains metadata and import statements. However, the use of wildcard imports from submodules introduces a security risk if any of those submodules contain malicious code. Without inspecting the submodules, a definitive malicious assessment cannot be made, but the pattern warrants caution.",
