  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initializer with metadata and broad imports. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could conceal malicious code in the imported modules. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a moderate risk score reflecting the import pattern. Continuous review of the imported modules is recommended to ensure security."
