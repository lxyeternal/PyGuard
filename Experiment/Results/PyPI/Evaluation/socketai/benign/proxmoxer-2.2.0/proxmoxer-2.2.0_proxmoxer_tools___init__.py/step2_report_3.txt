  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- Metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__)\n- Imports: `from . import *`, `from .files import *`, `from .tasks import *`\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code is minimal, likely an `__init__.py` or similar module.\n- Uses wildcard imports, which are generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution.\n- No direct malicious code, data handling, or network activity is present.\n- The actual content of imported submodules is unknown, which introduces some uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; metadata and imports.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the broad import pattern and potential risk but notes no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a caution about broad imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious code. The risk score is justified given wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the potential risk of wildcard imports but no actual malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Same as above.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Highlights that imports could conceal malicious code if submodules are malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.4, Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score of 0.4 is slightly higher, which is reasonable given the potential danger of imported modules. Malware remains 0, which is justified unless evidence of malicious submodules.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on the potential for imported modules to execute malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.3, Confidence 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score than Report 3, which is acceptable. Malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, emphasizing the risk of wildcard imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given no malicious code is visible.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports; no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Range from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting caution due to wildcard imports but no confirmed malicious activity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk scores are generally reasonable, considering the broad import pattern.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 unless further evidence of malicious submodules is found.\n- The confidence levels are appropriately high, given the limited code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code itself is straightforward and benign.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could hide malicious code if the imported modules are compromised.\n- Without access to submodule contents, it's impossible to definitively identify malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Comments |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0.2 - 0.4** | The code appears benign; the main concern is the import pattern. I agree with the current scores, perhaps leaning toward 0.2-0.3 for risk, as no malicious activity is evident. |\n\n**Final note:** The scores should remain conservative unless further investigation into the submodules reveals malicious content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed: No malicious code present in the snippet.  \n- Scores: Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2-0.4 (depending on caution).  \n- The use of wildcard imports warrants caution but is not malicious by itself.",
