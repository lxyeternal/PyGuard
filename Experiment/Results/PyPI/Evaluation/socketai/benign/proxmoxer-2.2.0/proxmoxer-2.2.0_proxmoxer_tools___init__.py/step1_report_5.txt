{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package, primarily setting author, copyright, and license metadata, and importing all symbols from local modules.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__author__, __copyright__, __license__); import statements from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static imports and metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (from . import *), which can obscure the actual imported symbols and potentially hide malicious or unnecessary code. No direct malicious activity detected, but wildcard imports can be a risk for supply chain security if the modules themselves are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, mainly setting author/license info and importing all contents from local modules 'files' and 'tasks'. There are no data processing, network operations, or credential handling. The wildcard imports could introduce hidden or malicious code if the modules are compromised, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign, mainly metadata and import statements. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can pose security risks if the imported modules are malicious. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or malware within this snippet.",
