  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` or main module that sets metadata and imports submodules.\n- All reports correctly identify the use of wildcard imports (`from . import *`, `from .files import *`, `from .tasks import *`) as potentially risky, as they obscure what is imported.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated code, or external network interactions is present in the snippet.\n- The primary concern is the broad import pattern, which could hide malicious code if submodules are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No, the code itself is straightforward, setting metadata and importing submodules. No malicious or suspicious code is directly visible.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and correctly identify the potential risk of wildcard imports. They appropriately note that no malicious code is evident from this fragment alone.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate, as no malicious activity is visible.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the potential risk due to wildcard imports. This seems reasonable, given the risk of hidden malicious code in imported modules.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since **no malicious code** or **obfuscation** is present, and the code is minimal, I agree with the current scores being low (around 0.2 to 0.4 for security risk).  \n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if submodules are compromised, but this cannot be confirmed here.\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for malicious code in submodules, a cautious but justified score would be around **0.3**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign and standard for package initialization.\n- The main security concern is the broad import pattern, which warrants cautious monitoring but does not indicate malicious activity by itself.\n- The current report scores are reasonable, but I would slightly adjust the overall risk score to **0.3** for a balanced view.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' conclusions and scores, with a minor adjustment to the overall risk score to reflect the potential but unconfirmed risk.**",
