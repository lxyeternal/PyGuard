{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set author and license metadata, and imports all contents from sibling modules and submodules.",
  "sources": "Module imports: __author__, __copyright__, __license__, and dynamic import statements.",
  "sinks": "Imports could lead to execution of external or hidden code if the imported modules contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly visible; however, imported modules may execute code upon import which could have side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from . import *' and 'from .files import *' can obscure actual code flow and make auditing difficult. No explicit code or logic present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors directly visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines metadata variables and imports all contents from sibling modules and submodules, which could execute code if those modules contain malicious payloads. The use of wildcard imports is risky as it obscures what is being imported and executed. No additional logic, input handling, or suspicious patterns are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily metadata and import statements with potential risks stemming from imported modules. The imports themselves are a common pattern but could be risky if the imported modules are malicious or compromised. No clear malicious activity or anomalies are evident solely from this fragment.",
