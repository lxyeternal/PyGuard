  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\n__author__ = \"John Hollowell\"\n__copyright__ = \"(c) John Hollowell 2022\"\n__license__ = \"MIT\"\n\nfrom . import *  # noqa: F401 F403\nfrom .files import *  # noqa: F401 F403\nfrom .tasks import *  # noqa: F401 F403\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Metadata plus broad imports; no malicious code evident.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.2 and 0 respectively.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. The concern about broad imports is valid but does not imply malicious intent here.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; benign with caution about wildcard imports.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.2 and 0 respectively.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. No malicious behavior detected; wildcard imports are risky but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Wildcard imports could conceal malicious code, but none is visible.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.4 and 0 respectively.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.4) is reasonable given the potential for imported modules to contain malicious code, even if not evident here.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Imports could execute malicious code if submodules are malicious.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.3 and 0 respectively.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The risk is mainly from the imported modules, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Mainly metadata and imports; no malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** 0.2 and 0 respectively.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code appears benign, with the wildcard imports being the main concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code in this fragment.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Varies between 0.2 and 0.4, primarily due to the use of wildcard imports, which can hide malicious code in the imported modules.\n\n**Given the code snippet:**\n- The code itself is benign.\n- The primary concern is the pattern of broad imports, which could be risky if the imported modules are malicious or compromised.\n- Without inspecting the submodules (`files`, `tasks`, or others), we cannot definitively determine if malicious code exists.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- To improve security posture, avoid wildcard imports in production code, especially in supply chain contexts.\n- Further investigation should include reviewing the contents of `files` and `tasks` modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2–0.4, reflecting the potential risk introduced by wildcard imports but not indicating active malicious behavior.\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations and the code's simplicity.",
