  "purpose": "This module appears to set metadata and import all symbols from its submodules for use in a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments at the top (__author__, __copyright__, __license__), and import statements for submodules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Metadata assignments are static; import statements may load code from other modules, but without further info, no specific data flow is identifiable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from . import *' and 'from .files import *' and 'from .tasks import *' can be considered unusual or risky as it imports everything from submodules, potentially hiding malicious code if any exists in those modules. No explicit secrets or malicious code are visible here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares author, copyright, and license metadata, then imports all symbols from local submodules. The wildcard imports ('*') can be risky as they make it difficult to track imported symbols and dependencies, but by itself, this does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or external network interactions. The lack of sensitive operations or data handling reduces suspicion. However, the use of broad import statements warrants caution if the submodules are malicious, but this cannot be determined solely from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package's __init__.py or main module, mainly handling metadata and importing submodules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident here. The main concern is the broad import statements, which could hide malicious code in the submodules, but that cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.",
