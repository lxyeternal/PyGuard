{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging the proxmoxer Python library, handling README files and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.txt or README.rst files; imports version from proxmoxer module; command-line arguments for sdist; file operations for README manipulation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, database, or external data output; only file read/write operations and package setup functions.",
  "flows": "Reads README files -> modifies README.txt during sdist -> passes metadata to setup() without executing untrusted code or data.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional rewriting of README.txt based on command-line arguments; standard in packaging scripts, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading and possibly modifying README files, importing version info, and calling setuptools.setup(). No network activity, user input handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The conditional README rewriting is a common practice for distribution, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risking behavior. All signals indicate a safe supply chain component.",
