  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described logic with the actual code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads README files, modifies them if necessary, and sets up package metadata.\n- It imports version info from the package itself.\n- No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The only potentially unusual activity is conditional file rewriting based on command-line arguments, which is typical for build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the script as a typical setup script with no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues here.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Also accurately describes the script as managing package metadata with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Correctly notes the script's purpose and the absence of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Also correctly describes the code as a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical evaluation of scoring:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, indicating no security risk, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional considerations:**\n- The only activity that could be questioned is the conditional rewriting of README files based on command-line arguments. This is common in setup scripts and not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious file manipulations.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign `setup.py` script.\n- Scores are consistent and justified.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard packaging logic, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated activity.",
