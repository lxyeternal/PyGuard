{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'proxmoxer' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README files from disk, extracts version info from proxmoxer module, and gathers package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "File existence checks and reading README files -> setting long_description -> setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The attempt to modify README.txt based on sdist argument is typical build logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads files and sets package metadata for distribution. It reads the README.txt or README.rst files, possibly modifies README.txt during source distribution creation, and sets up package parameters. It imports the proxmoxer version for dynamic versioning. All operations are typical for a setup.py script, with no indication of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. There are no network operations, data leaks, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging the proxmoxer library. No malicious or suspicious code was detected. It functions as intended for package distribution without any security risks.",
