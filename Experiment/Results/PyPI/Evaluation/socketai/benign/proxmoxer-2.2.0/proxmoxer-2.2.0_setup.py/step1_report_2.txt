  "purpose": "Setup script for the proxmoxer Python package, defining metadata and configuration for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.txt or README.rst files, environment variables (sys.argv), and package version from proxmoxer module.",
  "sinks": "File read/write operations, package setup functions, regex substitution on documentation, reading long description.",
  "flows": "Input files (README) -> Processing (regex substitution) -> Writing back to files; sys.argv influences logic flow, package setup config uses imported version.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional file rewriting of README.txt based on presence and command-line arguments; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package metadata and file I/O for setup. It conditionally rewrites README.txt if absent and 'sdist' is in arguments, replacing code blocks with '::'. It reads the README file for long description. No user input, network activity, or untrusted data handling is observed. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected. The use of 'codecs' and regex appears normal for setup scripts. Importing version from 'proxmoxer' is standard practice. Overall, the code performs standard package setup tasks without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It safely reads and writes documentation files and configures package metadata. No security risks or malware indications found.",
