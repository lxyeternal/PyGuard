  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for interacting with the Proxmox API: polling task status, decoding UPID strings, and formatting logs.\n- No user input is directly used in dangerous operations.\n- The code does not perform network operations beyond API calls, nor does it execute arbitrary code or handle sensitive credentials.\n- The UPID decoding performs format validation but does not execute or evaluate untrusted data beyond parsing.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign with no security risks or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical consistency:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All functions are straightforward, with proper validation.\n- **Error handling:** The UPID decoding raises an assertion if format mismatched, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the code is purely utility-focused.\n- **Flow of data:** Input parameters flow into parsing and API calls, with no dangerous operations.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions that lead to vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Purpose and sources:** The code's purpose is benign; sources are just parameters and API responses.\n- **Sinks:** No dangerous sinks or data leaks.\n- **Flows:** Straightforward data flow; no untrusted data processed insecurely.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with a benign utility module.\n- **Conclusion:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0 or 0.2, and obfuscated of 0. The confidence scores are high (0.9 to 1).\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with a few reports assigning 0.2, possibly reflecting a cautious stance due to the API interactions. Given the code's simplicity, 0.2 seems slightly high but acceptable if considering API interactions as potential vectors if misused.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** **0** or **0.2** — given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate; 0.2 might be slightly overcautious but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No changes needed unless further context suggests external factors.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.2 if considering API interactions as a slight vector, but still low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe utility module with no malicious intent or security issues.",
