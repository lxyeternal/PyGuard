  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with and decoding Proxmox API task data and logs.",
  "sources": "Input data includes task IDs (UPID strings), task log entries, and API responses.",
  "sinks": "API calls to fetch task status, and data processing within the class methods.",
  "flows": "Input UPID strings are decoded; API responses are polled in blocking status check; logs are formatted into strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external network activity; no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides methods for decoding UPID strings, polling task status, and formatting logs. It uses standard libraries like 'time' and simple data parsing techniques. No network connections other than expected API calls are observed. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity. The code does not perform any potentially dangerous operations such as executing arbitrary code or handling sensitive credentials. The logic appears to be straightforward API interaction and data formatting, with proper error checking on UPID format. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling Proxmox task data. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates as intended for API interactions and data decoding without security concerns.",
