  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any discrepancies, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a utility module for interacting with Proxmox API tasks: polling status, decoding UPID strings, and formatting logs.\n- No user input is directly used in dangerous operations.\n- No external network activity other than API calls, which are expected.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code performs validation on UPID format and handles errors appropriately.\n- The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for Proxmox tasks, no sensitive data or untrusted input processed insecurely.\n- Analysis: No malicious intent, well-structured, proper validation.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward parsing and polling.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code execution, network issues, or data exfiltration.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar observations: standard utility functions, proper validation, no suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: No network or system modifications, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2), but the analysis confirms no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- The securityRisk score seems a bit high given the code's nature; perhaps a conservative default.\n- Conclusion: Still safe, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. The malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the safe, straightforward nature of the code.\n- The securityRisk score is 0.2, consistent with cautious assessment.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** Mostly 0, with some at 0.2. Given the code's nature, these are conservative but acceptable. The code does not handle sensitive data or perform risky operations.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard utility module with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n- The risk scores are reasonable; no need to increase them.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent across reports, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.2 (appropriate, given the code's function and safety)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I agree with the assessments and scores provided in the reports. No modifications are necessary.",
