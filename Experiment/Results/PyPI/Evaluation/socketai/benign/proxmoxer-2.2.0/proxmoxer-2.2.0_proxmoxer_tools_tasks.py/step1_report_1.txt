{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for interacting with and decoding tasks in the Proxmox API, including status polling and UPID decoding.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as task_id, upid, and log_list; the Proxmox API responses (prox.nodes(node).tasks(task_id).status.get()).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no sensitive data or untrusted input directly processed into insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (task_id, upid, log_list) flow into decoding functions and API polling, with no external data being passed to unsafe sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The code performs standard API interaction and string parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static methods for interacting with Proxmox API tasks: polling task status, decoding UPID strings, and formatting logs. No user input is directly used in dangerous operations, nor are there any network connections or system modifications that could be malicious. The UPID decoding assumes a specific format but does not process untrusted data dangerously; errors are raised if format mismatched. No malicious or backdoor behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for managing Proxmox API tasks with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior or malware.",
