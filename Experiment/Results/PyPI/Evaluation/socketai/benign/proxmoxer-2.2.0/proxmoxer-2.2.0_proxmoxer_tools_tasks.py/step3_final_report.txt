  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with Proxmox API tasks: polling status, decoding UPID strings, and formatting logs.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as task_id, prox object, and log_list; API responses from prox.nodes(node).tasks(task_id).status.get(); UPID string input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in dangerous operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into parsing functions and API calls; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward validation and data formatting without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions with proper validation and no malicious behavior. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network exfiltration, or handle secrets. The UPID decoding strictly validates format, and polling uses safe time checks. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The API interactions are controlled and expected. All reports correctly identify the code as benign with malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the code's clarity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for managing Proxmox tasks. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
