{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for interacting with Proxmox API tasks, including polling task status and decoding task identifiers.",
  "sources": "The decode_upid method reads the UPID string; the blocking_status method reads task status from an API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The blocking_status method retrieves data from an external API; decode_log processes log data; no direct sinks of untrusted data lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "decode_upid parses input UPID string into fields; blocking_status uses this data to poll task status from API; decode_log processes log entries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior; straightforward API interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles parsing and polling operations. decode_upid strictly parses a string with a defined format, raising an error if format is invalid. blocking_status polls a provided API object for task status, with no untrusted input processing beyond method calls. decode_log formats logs into a string. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is evident. No hidden or suspicious behavior. Use of external API is expected and controlled, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for managing and decoding Proxmox tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It is standard, safe code handling task polling and string parsing, with no secret or backdoor indicators.",
