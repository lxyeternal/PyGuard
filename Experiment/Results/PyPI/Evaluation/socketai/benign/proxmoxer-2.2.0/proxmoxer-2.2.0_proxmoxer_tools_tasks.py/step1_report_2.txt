{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for interacting with Proxmox API tasks, including polling task status and decoding UPID strings.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from parameters such as 'task_id', 'log_list', and 'upid' strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network or system modification code present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and decoded; no external data flow to untrusted sources leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Functions perform straightforward parsing and polling.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly decodes UPID strings, polls task status, and formats logs. The UPID decoding includes validation to ensure correct format. No dynamic code execution, network transmission, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The polling function uses safe sleep and time checks. Overall, it appears to be standard utility code with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for Proxmox API interaction with no malicious intent or malicious code. It performs input validation and data formatting without any suspicious or malicious actions. No security threats or malware behaviors are evident.",
