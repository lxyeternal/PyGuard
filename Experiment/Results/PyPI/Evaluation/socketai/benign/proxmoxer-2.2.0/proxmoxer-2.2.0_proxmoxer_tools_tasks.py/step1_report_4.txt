{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for interacting with and decoding information from Proxmox API task endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'task_id' parameter, 'log_list' parameter, and the 'prox' object for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include returning task status, decoded UPID information, and formatted logs; no direct sinks involving untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'task_id' flows through 'decode_upid' to produce structured data; 'log_list' flows through 'decode_log' to generate a string; API calls retrieve data for status monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code functions as standard API interaction and data decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving standard parsing, polling, and string manipulation functions. The 'decode_upid' function performs format validation and parsing. The polling method uses time.sleep, which is typical. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. Usage of the 'prox' object assumes safe API access. No hardcoded credentials or insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for interacting with the Proxmox API. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its design is typical and safe for its intended purpose.",
