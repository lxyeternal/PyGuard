  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code establishes SSH sessions via paramiko, allowing command execution and file uploads.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- The code relies on external parameters for credentials, which is standard.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- Potential concerns are related to handling untrusted input for commands, but the code itself does not show such input sanitization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code as provided.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware score = 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign obfuscated = 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** The reports assign a low security risk (~0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All are consistent in their analysis: the code is standard, no malicious intent, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- They mention potential issues with untrusted command input, but the code snippet does not show input validation or sanitization, which could be a concern in a broader context, but as per the code, it's not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 for all.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.2) in some reports, which is reasonable given the handling of credentials and commands, but overall low.\n- **Overall risk:** The reports' overall assessments are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is appropriate.\n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to handling of credentials and command execution, but no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified, considering the handling of credentials and command execution.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1–0.2           | Low risk; standard SSH operations, external credential handling |\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure external inputs, especially commands, are sanitized in production environments to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.",
