  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and imports core module functions or classes.",
  "sources": "Package metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __version__, __license__), and import statement from .core.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are assigned static strings; import statement loads local module components.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('from .core import *') can be considered poor practice but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only package metadata definitions and a relative import of all components from a local core module. No runtime input, network communication, or suspicious behavior is observable. The wildcard import could potentially hide malicious imports if the core module is compromised, but on its own, this code snippet appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package metadata and import statement module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware within this code snippet. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
