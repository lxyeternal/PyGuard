  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports core functionalities from a local module.",
  "sources": "Metadata strings (__author__, __copyright__, __version__, __license__), and the import statement from .core.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with a wildcard; metadata strings are benign. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes module metadata variables with author, copyright, version, and license info. It then imports all contents from a local module named 'core'. This is a typical pattern for Python packages. The import is static and does not execute dynamic code or execute untrusted input. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata and import statements, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
