  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\n__author__ = \"Oleg Butovich\"\n__copyright__ = \"(c) Oleg Butovich 2013-2024\"\n__version__ = \"2.2.0\"\n__license__ = \"MIT\"\n\nfrom .core import *  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Metadata + import\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; import of local module is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Metadata + import\n- **Findings:** Use of `from .core import *` can be risky but common in `__init__.py`.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (cautious, due to wildcard import)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The risk score reflects potential issues with wildcard import, but no actual malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar to previous, with emphasis on the risk of importing all symbols.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No malware detected, but the import pattern warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Same pattern, standard metadata + import.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Same as others, with note on poor practice but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The risk score is slightly higher due to poor practice but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated due to use of `import *`, but justified as a common pattern in package `__init__.py` files.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation.\n- The use of `from .core import *` is a common pattern but can be risky if the imported module is compromised; however, no evidence suggests malicious intent here.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to import practices, but not inherently dangerous)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code appears benign, with the only caveat being the import style, which is standard in package `__init__.py` files but warrants separate review of the `core` module for security.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores. The reasoning is sound, and the code fragment is low risk.",
