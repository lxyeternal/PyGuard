{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the package and imports all contents from a local core module.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __version__, __license__), import statement from .core",
  "sinks": "Potential import of all symbols from core module; no explicit sinks in this snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow, only metadata assignments and import statement",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .core import *' which can obscure imported symbols; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables and imports everything from a local core module. The import statement 'from .core import *' can potentially import hidden or malicious symbols if the core module contains malicious code. However, in this snippet, there is no direct malicious behavior or suspicious code present. The metadata is typical for a Python package. The overall structure is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be standard package metadata setup with a potentially risky import statement. There are no indications of malicious behavior or malware within this snippet itself, but the imported core module should be reviewed separately for security concerns.",
