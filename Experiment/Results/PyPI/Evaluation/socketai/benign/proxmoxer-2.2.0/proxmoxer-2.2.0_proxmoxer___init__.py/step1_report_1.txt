{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set module metadata and import core functionality from a local module.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__author__, __copyright__, __version__, __license__), import statement from local module .core",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "None, as there are no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a relative import, which is normal; no suspicious code or hidden logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code only contains metadata declarations and a single relative import of a local module. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The import of a local core module does not indicate malicious intent by itself. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module metadata declaration with a standard import; no malicious or security risks are evident from this code fragment.",
