  "purpose": "Module metadata declarations and import of all symbols from a local core module.",
  "sources": "Module metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __version__, __license__), import statement 'from .core import *'",
  "sinks": "Potential namespace pollution from 'import *', no other sinks present",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are static, import brings in symbols from .core (potential namespace pollution)",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' in a module's __init__.py is a known pattern but can be risky; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard metadata variables and imports all symbols from a local module using a wildcard. No dynamic code execution, no input/output, no obfuscated code. The wildcard import could pose namespace risks if the core module is malicious, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and typical for package initialization files. Scores assigned in reports reflect the low risk and benign nature, with the main concern being the import pattern rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of 'import *' is a common but potentially risky pattern in __init__.py files, but in the absence of evidence of compromise, it does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) due to the import pattern.",
