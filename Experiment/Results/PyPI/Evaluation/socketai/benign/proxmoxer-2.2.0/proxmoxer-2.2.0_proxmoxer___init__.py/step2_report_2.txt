  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\n__author__ = \"Oleg Butovich\"\n__copyright__ = \"(c) Oleg Butovich 2013-2024\"\n__version__ = \"2.2.0\"\n__license__ = \"MIT\"\n\nfrom .core import *  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Reports**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Metadata + import, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly identifies the code as metadata declarations and a simple import. No malicious activity or data flow is evident. The conclusion is accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Metadata + import; notes 'import *' as potentially risky but common in `__init__.py`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe caution about 'import *' is valid, but in this context (likely an `__init__.py`), it's standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior are present. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, though perhaps slightly conservative. The malware score remains at 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, highlights potential risk of 'import *' but no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, accurate. The import statement could be risky if the core module is compromised, but there's no evidence here. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Metadata + import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Metadata + import, 'import *' considered poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify the code as simple metadata declarations and a relative import of a local module. No malicious activity or data flow is evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate. They appropriately note the use of 'import *' as potentially risky but not malicious in this context.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious behavior is observed.  \n  The security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the use of 'import *' and the nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate. No evidence suggests a higher risk.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code is benign. The 'import *' could be risky if the imported module is malicious, but there's no evidence here. So, malware score remains at 0.\n\n- **Challenging assumptions:**  \n  The reports assume that 'import *' is potentially risky but not malicious. This is correct. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard best practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment**\n\n**Based on the code snippet and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal risk, mostly due to 'import *' practice)\n\nThe overall assessment aligns with the reports' findings. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The use of 'import *' is standard in package `__init__.py` files but should be reviewed in the context of the imported module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative scoring reflects the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
