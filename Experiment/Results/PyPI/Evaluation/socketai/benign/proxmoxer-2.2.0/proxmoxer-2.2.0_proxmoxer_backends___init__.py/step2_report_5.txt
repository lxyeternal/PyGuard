  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature**:  \n   The code consists solely of metadata declarations:\n   ```python\n   __author__ = \"Oleg Butovich\"\n   __copyright__ = \"(c) Oleg Butovich 2013-2017\"\n   __license__ = \"MIT\"\n   ```\n   There are no functions, data processing, external communications, or executable logic.\n\n2. **Issue Presence & Malicious Behavior**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies confirms this.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. The code is benign metadata.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They recognize that the code is harmless and contains only standard metadata.\n\n5. **Potential for Change in Scores**:  \n   Since the code is trivial and contains no suspicious or malicious content, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - The code's purpose is purely documentation within a package, and it poses no security threat.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code content.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is entirely benign metadata declarations with no security issues. All reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are needed.",
