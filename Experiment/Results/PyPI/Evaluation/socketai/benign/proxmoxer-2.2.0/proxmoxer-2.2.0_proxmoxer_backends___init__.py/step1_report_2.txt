  "purpose": "Metadata declarations for author, copyright, and license information",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or sent to untrusted sinks",
  "flows": "No data flows present as there are only metadata assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is purely declarative metadata",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for author, copyright, and license metadata. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions. This is standard metadata boilerplate often found at the top of Python modules, serving informational purposes only. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only standard metadata declarations with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risk.",
