  "purpose": "Metadata declarations (__author__, __copyright__, __license__) for the Python package, serving informational and licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to metadata variables; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments with no data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata declarations with clear, human-readable strings.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static metadata variables with string assignments. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, network calls, or external interactions. The code is standard for Python modules and does not include obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
