It uses 'shell_split' and 'shell_join' to handle command arguments, which can be exploited if inputs are malicious. The _exec method is abstracted, so actual execution security depends on its implementation. No embedded malware or obfuscation is present. The primary risk is command injection if inputs are not sanitized. The code appears to be a standard remote command execution framework with known security considerations.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is not malicious but has significant command injection risks if untrusted inputs are used without validation. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting moderate to high risk due to potential injection vulnerabilities. Proper input validation and safer subprocess handling are recommended to mitigate these risks.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.6\n}",
