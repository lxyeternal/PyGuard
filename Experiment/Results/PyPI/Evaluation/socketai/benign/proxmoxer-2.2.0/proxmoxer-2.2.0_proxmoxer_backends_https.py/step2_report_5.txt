  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Proxmox API client with token/password auth, request handling, large file upload support, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  *Reasoning:* The low risk score seems appropriate given the code's functionality and no malicious indicators. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, confirms legitimate API client with no malicious activity, standard practices, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n  *Reasoning:* The even lower risk score aligns with the lack of concerning behavior. Malware remains zero, consistent with observations.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—legitimate client, no malicious code, SSL warnings disabled but this is common, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  *Reasoning:* Disabling SSL warnings is a potential security concern but not malicious. The risk score is slightly higher but still low; malware remains zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a legitimate API client with proper handling, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  *Reasoning:* Consistent with prior assessments.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  *Reasoning:* The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical API client library for Proxmox with no signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Malware Scores:**  \n  All are zero, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Scores:**  \n  The scores are generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. The only potential issue is the disabling of SSL warnings (`requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()`), which could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but in the context of an SDK, this is a common practice and not malicious.\n\n- **Potential Flaws or Assumptions:**  \n  No flawed logic or suspicious assumptions are evident. The code's flow is clear, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis. Malware is correctly zero, obfuscated is zero, and risk is low but not zero, acknowledging minor security considerations like SSL warnings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- Code is clear and readable, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.2**  \n- Slightly elevated due to SSL warnings being disabled, which could be a security concern if misused, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Proxmox VE.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The low risk score is appropriate, considering the disabling of SSL warnings, which is a common but potentially insecure practice.\n- Overall, the supply chain risk appears minimal, and the code is safe for deployment in trusted environments.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0.2**   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
