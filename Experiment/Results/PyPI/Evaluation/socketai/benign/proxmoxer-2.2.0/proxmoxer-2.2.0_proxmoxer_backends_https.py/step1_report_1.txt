{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client library for authenticating and interacting with a Proxmox VE API server, supporting token-based and password-based authentication, request handling, and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from user credentials (username, password, token info), configuration parameters, and response contents from HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request headers (for authentication tokens and CSRF tokens), response JSON parsing, request stream handling for file uploads.",
  "flows": "Input credentials → Auth classes generate tokens → HTTP requests include tokens/headers → Responses parsed for data or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Use of 'requests' is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious network behavior detected. The code handles large file uploads with optional 'requests_toolbelt' support, which is normal functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward client implementation for Proxmox API with standard authentication methods and request handling. It performs token refresh, manages cookies, supports large file uploads, and processes JSON responses. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present. The logic aligns with normal SDK practices. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption. The only potential concern is the handling of large file uploads, but this is within normal SDK functionality. Overall, the code appears to be a typical API client library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate API client library for Proxmox VE with no evident malicious or sabotage code. It performs expected functions related to authentication and HTTP request management. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
