  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Proxmox API client, handling authentication, session, and large file uploads. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, justified by the nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scoring are reasonable. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard API client with proper handling of tokens, credentials, and requests. No suspicious behavior or secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate client, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical API client with standard practices. Noted that SSL warnings are disabled, which could be insecure but not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, acceptable given the SSL warning disabling.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the SSL warning is a minor security concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, with proper handling of credentials and large files. No suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API client.\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard API client, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe supply chain.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malware or backdoors:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, mainly related to SSL warnings, which are common and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the analysis; malware scores are zero, and risk scores are low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity or code is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** Should stay low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minor concerns about SSL warnings but nothing malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain risk for this code appears negligible. It is a legitimate, well-structured API client library with no signs of malicious intent.",
