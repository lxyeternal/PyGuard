  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard API client for Proxmox, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. It handles token refresh, large file uploads, and JSON responses appropriately. No signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code appears legitimate, with standard authentication and request handling. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. SSL warnings are disabled, which could be insecure but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected; low risk score justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical API client with proper token management and large file upload support. The disabling of SSL warnings is noted but is common in client libraries and not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious indicators; the risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no signs of malicious activity. Proper handling of credentials, tokens, and uploads. SSL warning suppression is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious intent; low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusions; the code is a standard API client with no signs of sabotage or malware. Proper management of credentials and requests.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns (e.g., SSL warnings being disabled). These are reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor security concern due to SSL warnings being disabled, but not malicious.\n\n**Note:** Given the thorough review, I concur with the provided scores. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client library for Proxmox with no malicious or sabotage intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis is the reasoned conclusion based on the detailed review.",
