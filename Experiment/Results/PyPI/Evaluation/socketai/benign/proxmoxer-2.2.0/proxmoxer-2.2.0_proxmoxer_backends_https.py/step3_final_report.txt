{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a client library for interacting with the Proxmox VE API, supporting token and password authentication, session management, and large file uploads.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, authentication credentials, and input files; accesses network endpoints for authentication and API requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API endpoints; potential data leaks if credentials or tokens are mishandled; request headers and cookies could be exploited if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input credentials and configuration → Authentication requests → Session management → API requests with tokens or cookies → Data uploads/downloads.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL warnings via 'requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()' is a security concern but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client for Proxmox VE, implementing standard authentication methods, session handling, and large file upload support. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The disabling of SSL warnings is a common practice in testing environments but could be insecure if misused. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minor concerns related to SSL warnings, but overall the code is low risk. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. No suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented client library for Proxmox VE with no evidence of sabotage or malicious behavior. The low security risk is primarily due to SSL warning suppression, which is a common but potentially insecure practice. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is very strong, with no malicious indicators.",
