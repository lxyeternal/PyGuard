  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward API client for Proxmox VE, supporting token and password authentication, with standard request handling and large file upload support.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Comments:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code's logic is consistent with typical SDKs. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe is justified. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client practices, proper credential handling, and request management.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. SSL warnings are disabled, which is a minor security concern but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate; the low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same general conclusion—standard API client with token and password auth, no hardcoded secrets, and proper request handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** Disabling SSL warnings is noted but not malicious; it’s a common practice in some client libraries, albeit insecure if misused.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious indicators; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical API client with token/password support, session management, and large file upload support.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** No suspicious behavior; standard practices are followed.\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard API client, secure credential handling, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** No signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The code is legitimate; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no malicious activity detected. This aligns with the code analysis; no backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behavior are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns such as disabling SSL warnings or handling large files, but nothing indicating malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or backdoors detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor security concerns (e.g., SSL warnings disabled), but overall low risk.\n\n**The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured client library for Proxmox VE with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.**",
