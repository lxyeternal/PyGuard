  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented client library for Proxmox VE with no evidence of sabotage or malicious behavior. The low security risk is primarily due to SSL warning suppression, which is a common but potentially insecure practice. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is very strong, with no malicious indicators."
