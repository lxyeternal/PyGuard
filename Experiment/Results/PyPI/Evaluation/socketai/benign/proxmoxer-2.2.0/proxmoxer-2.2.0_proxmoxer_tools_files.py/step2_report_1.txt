  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard utility for uploading/downloading files with checksum verification in Proxmox. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — seems high given the benign analysis; the only concern mentioned is external URL reliance, which is typical.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The report is consistent; no suspicious code or logic flaws.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. The low malware score is justified. The security risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1, but 0.2 is acceptable considering external URL dependency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing legitimate file management with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 or 0.2 — the report gives 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent, straightforward, standard library usage.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion: legitimate utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, given network requests for checksum files.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard file management with checksum validation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a legitimate utility with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with network activity for checksum files.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly identify no malware presence; all are 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0.2, reflecting typical network interactions for checksum verification, which is acceptable. Slightly conservative but reasonable.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, well-structured utility for file management and checksum validation in a Proxmox environment. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or code injection is evident.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 across all reports, reflecting normal network operations for checksum verification.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and aligns with best practices for file integrity verification. The scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
