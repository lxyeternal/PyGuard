  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for file management and integrity verification in a Proxmox environment. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified due to external URL reliance, which is typical for checksum validation. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with best practices."
