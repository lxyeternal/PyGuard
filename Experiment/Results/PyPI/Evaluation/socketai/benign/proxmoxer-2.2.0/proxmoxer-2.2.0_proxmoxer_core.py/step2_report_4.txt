  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard API client for Proxmox.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and doesn't show signs of malicious behavior. The low security risk score aligns with this. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar API client implementation.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature. The input flows are typical, and no malicious activity is suggested. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** API client, handling requests and resources.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard URL handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is typical for an API client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Malicious Indicators:\n- **Hardcoded secrets?** None detected.\n- **Obfuscated code?** No.\n- **Suspicious network activity?** Not evident; the code makes standard HTTP requests via session objects.\n- **Dynamic code execution?** Only dynamic importlib usage, which is constrained to known modules.\n- **Malicious patterns?** No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or covert channels.\n\n### On the scores:\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The security risk scores are very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Proxmox.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise.\n- The dynamic import of backend modules is standard practice, assuming trusted modules.\n- The overall security posture is very good.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to dynamic module import, which is common and safe here)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The supply chain risk here is negligible based on the provided code and analysis.",
