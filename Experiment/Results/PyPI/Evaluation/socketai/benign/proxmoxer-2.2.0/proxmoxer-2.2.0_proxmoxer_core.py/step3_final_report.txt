{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python API client for Proxmox, supporting multiple services and backends, with dynamic module loading, URL construction, request handling, and error management.",
  "sources": "URL parsing and construction, request parameters, method calls, dynamic module import for backends",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution via session.request, exception raising on HTTP errors",
  "flows": "Input parameters and resource identifiers flow into URL construction and request methods, with error handling based on response status",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; dynamic import constrained within known namespace",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client that uses common libraries and practices. It performs URL joining, request execution, and error handling appropriately. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration behaviors are evident. The dynamic import of backend modules is controlled and typical for plugin-like architectures. No obfuscation or suspicious code flows are present. The request handling includes proper error checking and response parsing. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented API client for Proxmox with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
