{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python client library for interacting with Proxmox API servers, supporting multiple backends and services.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, URL strings, and session request responses.",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs, request data and parameters, error messages, and response content.",
  "flows": "URL construction and session requests transfer data from inputs (parameters, URLs, responses) to outputs (API requests, error messages).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code, code injection, or dynamic execution appears. No suspicious URL or domain handling is visible. No hardcoded tokens, passwords, or API keys are detected. Use of standard libraries and conventional API patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions to interact with the Proxmox API, including URL management, request handling, and error management. It validates service types and backends, raises errors for unsupported configurations, and manages request-response cycles with proper error handling. No suspicious or malicious code such as system data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present. The code is structured and appears to follow standard API client design, with proper exception handling and logging. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks, malicious behavior, or security flaws in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard API client implementation for Proxmox with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical URL and request handling without exposing secrets or performing malicious actions. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
