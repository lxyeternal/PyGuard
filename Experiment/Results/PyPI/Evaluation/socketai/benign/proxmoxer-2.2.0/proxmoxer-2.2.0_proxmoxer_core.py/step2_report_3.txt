  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a Python library for Proxmox API interactions, with standard modules and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP requests, URL building, exception raising—standard behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, dynamic import of backend modules within a known namespace—typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Finds no malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar API client functions, with untrusted input from user parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Requests over network, URL construction from user input—potentially risky if inputs are malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard practices. Input sanitization is handled via filtering None values.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected, very low security risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent; the code is a typical API client with proper input sanitization. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, with dynamic module import, request handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP requests, exception handling, dynamic attribute access.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is appropriate. The code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, with URL and request management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, resource identifiers.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard library use.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API client, with standard request and URL handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP requests, error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious URL handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is sound; no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate API client.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The dynamic import of backend modules is within a controlled namespace.\n- The request handling and URL construction are standard and do not exhibit vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the findings.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the thorough review and lack of any suspicious activity, a low but non-zero risk score (~0.1) is appropriate, considering potential misconfigurations or future vulnerabilities.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client)\n\nThis code appears safe, legitimate, and well-structured, with no signs of supply chain or malicious activity.",
