  "purpose": "This code imports the NewsApiClient class from the newsapi.newsapi_client module, likely to be used for interacting with the NewsAPI service.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this minimal snippet; it only imports a class for potential later use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious syntax are present. The '# noqa' comment suppresses linter warnings but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no runtime execution, data handling, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about its benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The code is standard and safe. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
