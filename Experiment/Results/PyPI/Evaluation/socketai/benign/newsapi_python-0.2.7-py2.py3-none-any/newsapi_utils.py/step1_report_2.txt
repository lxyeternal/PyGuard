{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to validate and format date and datetime strings or objects into ISO-8601 format.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters `dt` for conversion and validation functions that accept date/datetime strings or objects.",
  "sinks": "The code formats data into strings using `strftime` and `utcfromtimestamp`, which are safe operations; no data is sent or leaked externally.",
  "flows": "Input `dt` (string, date, datetime, number) flows through validation or conversion functions, resulting in formatted date string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code. The code uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code safely validates and formats date inputs, supporting multiple formats and types, with proper regex validation and type checks. No network, file, or sensitive data handling observed. No dynamic code execution or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for date validation and formatting with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs expected, safe operations without external communication or hidden logic.",
