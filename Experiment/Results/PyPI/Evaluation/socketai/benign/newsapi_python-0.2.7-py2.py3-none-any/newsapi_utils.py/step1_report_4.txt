{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to convert various date and datetime inputs into standardized string formats, validating input formats as needed.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (dt in stringify_date_param) and type checks within helper functions (is_valid_string, is_valid_num).",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the return statements in stringify_date_param that output formatted date strings, and the exception raises for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameter dt flows through validation functions (is_valid_string, is_valid_num), then is formatted with strftime or converted from timestamp, or triggers exceptions if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code employs standard date validation and formatting without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regular expressions for date and datetime formats, validation functions, and a main function that converts various input types into date strings. It performs input validation, type checking, and format conversions. No external data is fetched, network operations, or suspicious code flows are present. The only potential concern is input validation, but it is straightforward and appropriate for date formatting. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard date handling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It performs input validation and formatting in a typical manner without any malicious or suspicious features.",
