  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to validate and stringify date and datetime objects or strings in ISO-8601 format.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters (dt) which can be strings, datetime objects, or numeric timestamps.",
  "sinks": "The main output is the formatted date/datetime string returned by stringify_date_param.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and then formatted; no external data or untrusted sources are directly involved or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code is present. The code performs straightforward date validation and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for date/datetime validation and functions to validate and format input data. It supports multiple Python versions, adjusting type checks accordingly. No external network, file operations, or environment variable usages are involved. The functions perform simple validation and string formatting without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data. The code's purpose is to process date inputs reliably, with proper validation and formatting, and does not contain malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for date handling with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It is well-structured, clear, and safe for use.",
