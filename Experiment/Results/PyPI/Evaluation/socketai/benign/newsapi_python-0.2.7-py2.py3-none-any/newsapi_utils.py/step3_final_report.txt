  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating, formatting, and converting date/datetime inputs into ISO-8601 string representations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to stringify_date_param, including strings, date/datetime objects, numeric timestamps, and None.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation (regex or type checks), then formatting functions like strftime or utcfromtimestamp.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; regex validation is standard; no obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation and formatting of date/datetime inputs, using regex for string validation and standard library functions for formatting. It handles multiple input types with proper type checks and supports both Python 2 and 3. No network, file, or external system interactions are present. The validation regex patterns are standard ISO-8601 formats. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The code is well-structured, simple, and safe, with no security vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for date validation and formatting, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
