{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and allowed parameter values for the News API, serving as configuration data.",
  "sources": "Static URL constants and predefined sets for countries, languages, categories, and sort methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static. Notably, 'en-US' in languages set may be inconsistent with standard language codes but does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining constants and allowed parameter values for an API client. It contains no dynamic input handling, external data processing, or executable logic. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The inclusion of 'en-US' in the languages set is unusual but not malicious. All security signals indicate benign static configuration. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified.",
