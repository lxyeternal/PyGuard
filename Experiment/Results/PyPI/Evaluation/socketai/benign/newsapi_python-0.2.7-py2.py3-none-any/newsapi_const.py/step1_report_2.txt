{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and allowed parameter values for querying the News API, including URLs and valid options for country codes, languages, categories, and sort methods.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data dynamically.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines static constants and sets of allowed values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code only contains static URL constants and predefined sets of valid parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code provides constants for API endpoints and sets of valid parameter values for countries, languages, categories, and sort methods. These are used to validate or constrain user input for API requests. No dynamic code execution, no reading of external data, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no suspicious code structures are present. The code is purely declarative with predefined static data, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of constants and allowed values for API parameters, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger application that interacts with the News API, providing validation for query parameters.",
