  "purpose": "Define constants and allowed parameter values for interacting with the News API, including URLs and valid input options for countries, languages, categories, and sort methods.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read in this code; all data are hardcoded constants and sets.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data handling or output functions are included.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this code only defines static data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly defines constants and sets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of URL constants and sets of allowed parameter values for country codes, language codes, categories, and sort methods. All are static definitions without data input handling or processing logic. There are no indications of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The purpose is to restrict parameter values for API requests, ensuring valid inputs. The code's structure and content are straightforward and standard for configuration constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module setting constants for API interaction. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
