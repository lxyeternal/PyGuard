  "purpose": "Define constants and allowed parameter values for interacting with the News API.",
  "sources": "No external input reading in this code; data is hardcoded constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares constants and sets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of static URL definitions and set declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines URLs and sets of valid values for countries, languages, categories, and sorting methods used in News API requests. All data are hardcoded and static, with no input handling or dynamic execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to serve as configuration constants only, with no malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for News API parameters, containing no malicious activity or security risks. It provides constants and allowed values for API parameters, with no evident signs of malware or security threats.",
