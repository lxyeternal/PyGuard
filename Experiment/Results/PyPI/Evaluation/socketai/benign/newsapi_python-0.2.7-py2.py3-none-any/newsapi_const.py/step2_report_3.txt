  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the findings, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static, configuration-like, with no dynamic input, external data, or execution.\n- The code consists solely of URL constants and sets of allowed parameter values.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The reports uniformly assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The analysis correctly identifies that the code is static configuration data with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since the code only defines constants and sets, with no dynamic execution, no external data handling, or obfuscated code, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Given the static nature and lack of vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential for False Positives:**  \n  The reports do not assume malicious intent beyond static analysis, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious activity are made or implied.\n- The code's purpose is purely to define constants and allowed parameter values, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, static, configuration nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are correct and consistent. The code is a safe, static configuration module with no security risks or malicious behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclude that the code poses no security threat.",
