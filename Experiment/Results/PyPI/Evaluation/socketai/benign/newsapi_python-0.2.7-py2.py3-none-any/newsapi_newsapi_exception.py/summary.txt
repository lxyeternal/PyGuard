  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple exception class with a minor robustness flaw related to missing key validation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current high risk scores are overstated; a low risk score (~0.1) is more appropriate, reflecting the potential for runtime errors but no security threat."
