  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- A custom exception class that wraps an exception object (likely a dictionary).\n- Provides getter methods for 'status', 'code', and 'message'.\n- The methods check if the keys exist but do not handle missing keys explicitly, which could cause runtime errors if the dictionary is malformed.\n- No network, file, or external system interaction.\n- No obfuscation, no malware, no malicious intent apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior. The concern about missing key handling is noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score (0.9) seems somewhat high given the benign nature. The code's potential for runtime errors due to missing keys is a minor issue, not a security risk.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower the risk score to around 0.2-0.3, as it doesn't pose a security threat.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the simplicity and benign nature. The lack of key validation is noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the high risk score overstates the actual security concern.\n- **Recommendation:** Adjust risk score downward, e.g., 0.2-0.3.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Again, straightforward, no malicious activity, just missing key validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 1 is too high; this is a benign code pattern.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce to about 0.2.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—benign, simple exception wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Overstated; should be lower.\n- **Recommendation:** About 0.2-0.3.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, no malicious behavior, only potential for runtime errors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Overestimating the security risk.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower to ~0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** The current scores (mostly 0.9 or 1) are too high given the benign nature of the code. These are simple data container classes with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk:** Should be lowered to around **0.2** for all reports, reflecting that the code is benign but with minor issues (lack of key validation leading to potential runtime errors).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign exception class. The main concern is robustness (missing key handling), not security. The current high risk scores are overstated and should be adjusted accordingly.",
