{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling error responses from the News API.",
  "sources": "The constructor accepts an exception object (likely a dictionary), and methods access keys 'status', 'code', 'message' from this object.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data for output or system actions; methods only retrieve data from the exception object.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the exception object passed during instantiation through getter methods; no external or untrusted data flow to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The get_status, get_code, and get_message methods perform conditional checks but do not handle missing keys or validate data types; this is not inherently suspicious but could lead to runtime errors if the exception object structure differs.",
  "analysis": "The class serves as a simple data wrapper around an exception object, providing accessor methods for specific fields. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard exception handler implementation. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The only potential concern is reliance on the exception object structure without validation, which could lead to errors if misused but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless exception wrapper class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple data container used for error handling in API responses.",
