{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling error responses from the News API.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the class only operates on an 'exception' object passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class simply provides accessors for stored exception data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and adheres to typical exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an exception type with methods to retrieve error details from an internal exception object. The methods access dictionary keys such as 'status', 'code', and 'message' without any dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or execute external commands. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a custom exception class for API error handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
