{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors from the News API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'exception' dictionary passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or perform insecure actions.",
  "flows": "The class methods access attributes of the 'exception' dictionary; no external data flow or execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The get_status, get_code, and get_message methods check if the dictionary key exists but do not handle missing keys or invalid types, which could cause runtime errors; no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates an exception object and provides getter methods to retrieve 'status', 'code', and 'message' fields from it. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or external dependencies that could be malicious. The only potential concern is that the methods assume the presence of keys without error handling, which could lead to runtime exceptions but not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured custom exception class intended for handling API error responses. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be benign and focused solely on error encapsulation.",
