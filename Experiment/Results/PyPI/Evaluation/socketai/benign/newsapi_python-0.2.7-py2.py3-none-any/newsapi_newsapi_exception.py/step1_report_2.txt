{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors from the News API.",
  "sources": "The exception object passed during initialization, specifically the dictionary containing 'status', 'code', and 'message'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data is written to external systems or output without validation.",
  "flows": "Input data from the exception dictionary flows into class attributes and getter methods, but there are no external effects or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "The 'get_status', 'get_code', and 'get_message' methods attempt to access dictionary keys without handling missing keys, which could cause runtime exceptions, but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward custom exception wrapper for error data from the News API. It stores an exception dictionary and provides accessor methods. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code does not perform network operations, file operations, or include obfuscated/malicious logic. The only minor concern is the lack of key existence checks in getter methods, which could lead to runtime errors if the dictionary is malformed, but this is not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a data container for error details. No signs of malware or security issues are detected.",
