{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors from the News API.",
  "sources": "The exception object passed during initialization, accessing its 'status', 'code', and 'message' keys.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data output or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input from the exception object flows through getter methods but no external untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The getter methods check 'if self.exception[\"key\"]' without verifying the presence of the key or handling potential KeyError; also, they assume 'self.exception' is a dictionary with specific keys. No other suspicious behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward custom exception handler encapsulating an error object, likely a dictionary. It provides methods to access 'status', 'code', and 'message'. The methods include simple key checks, but they assume the keys exist without exception handling, which could lead to runtime errors if 'self.exception' lacks these keys. No malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is simple and does not perform any network or file operations. There is no evidence of obfuscated code or malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign custom exception class designed to encapsulate API error responses. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose appears to be standard error handling within an application.",
