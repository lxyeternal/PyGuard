{
  "purpose": "A custom exception class wrapping an exception object (likely a dictionary) to provide access to 'status', 'code', and 'message' fields.",
  "sources": "The exception object `self.exception`, accessed via dictionary keys 'status', 'code', and 'message'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond reading from the exception object.",
  "flows": "Data flows from `self.exception` to the getter methods, which return specific fields if present.",
  "anomalies": "The getter methods check key existence with `if self.exception[\"key\"]:` without handling missing keys, which could cause runtime errors if keys are absent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward exception wrapper that provides access to error details. It does not perform any network, file, or external system operations. The main concern is the lack of key existence validation, which could lead to `KeyError` exceptions if the exception object is malformed. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and benign nature are confirmed by multiple reports. The high security risk scores (near 1) are overstated; a more accurate assessment would assign a very low risk score (~0.1) due to potential runtime errors, but no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, simple exception class with a minor robustness flaw related to missing key validation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current high risk scores are overstated; a low risk score (~0.1) is more appropriate, reflecting the potential for runtime errors but no security threat.",
