  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports specific classes for a client library related to Google services.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'ServicesAsyncClient' and 'ServicesClient' from local modules",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication within this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard licensing comments and imports two classes from local modules, then defines __all__ for exports. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or external network calls are present. It functions solely as an API surface for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that exposes client classes for use elsewhere. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks based on the provided content.",
