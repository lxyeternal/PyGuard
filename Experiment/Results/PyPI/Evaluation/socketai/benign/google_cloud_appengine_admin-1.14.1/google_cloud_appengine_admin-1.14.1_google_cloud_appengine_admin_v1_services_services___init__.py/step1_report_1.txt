  "purpose": "To expose and re-export classes for synchronous and asynchronous service clients from a package, facilitating their import and usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules: .async_client and .client.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink are observable in this code snippet; it merely imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code appears to be a straightforward module interface.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and defines an __all__ variable for public API exposure. There are no operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The licensing comments are standard, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Given the simplicity, no security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for re-exporting classes, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a normal part of a package structure.",
