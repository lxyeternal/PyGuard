  "purpose": "The code implements pagination helpers for iterating through 'list_services' API responses in Google Cloud App Engine Admin API.",
  "sources": "The code reads initial request objects, response objects, method call functions, and optional retry parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code yields service data from API responses, which could potentially be misused if the data contains sensitive information, but no direct data leaks or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input request and response objects are used to make API calls through provided method functions, with response data being iterated over and paginated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of try-except for optional attributes is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard pagination helper classes for API responses. It handles both synchronous and asynchronous pagination. No suspicious or malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors is detected. The handling of API response objects and method calls is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present. The structure is typical for generated or boilerplate API client code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard API pagination utility code with no malicious behavior detected. It is well-structured, handles pagination securely, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious features.",
