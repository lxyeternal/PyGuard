{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and registers different transport classes for a service, likely used for communication purposes in a larger SDK or framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) and the creation of a registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink locations; no data leaks or security-sensitive outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Imports → registry dictionary creation → exporting module symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up a registry for transport classes, and defines exports. It contains no user input handling, no data processing, and no network communication or cryptography. The structure is straightforward and standard for module setup. No anomalies, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python SDK, registering transport classes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
