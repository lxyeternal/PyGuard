  "purpose": "Register transport classes for a client SDK, setting up a registry of transport types.",
  "sources": "Imports of transport classes and creation of an ordered dictionary for registration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external data handling, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Static import statements to registry assignment; no dynamic data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module that imports specific transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no user input, external data, network activity, or cryptographic operations. The structure is standard for SDK configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK setup component with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, consistent with its function and structure.",
