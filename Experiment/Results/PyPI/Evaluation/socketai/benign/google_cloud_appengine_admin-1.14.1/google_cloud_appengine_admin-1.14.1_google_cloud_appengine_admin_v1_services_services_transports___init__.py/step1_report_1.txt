{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for a service API, facilitating multiple communication protocols (gRPC, REST, etc.)",
  "sources": "Import statements, code that accesses modules and creates an ordered dictionary for transport registry",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or external system interactions",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard pattern for registry and module exports",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a registry of transport classes for a service API, importing relevant modules and registering them in an ordered dictionary. No user input, external data, or secret handling is present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected. The license header indicates open-source intent and proper licensing. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward, benign setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for transport class registration with no malicious or security-risk behavior. It is benign and related to configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payload.",
