{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers different transport classes for a service, likely part of a client SDK, facilitating communication via gRPC, async gRPC, and REST.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) and the creation of an internal registry (_transport_registry). No external user input or data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data leakage, code injection points, or external communication within this code segment.",
  "flows": "N/A - there are no source-to-sink data flows or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments identified. The code appears straightforward and standard for setting up transport registry.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module for setting up transport class registry for a service, including type annotations and explicit exports. It only defines data structures and imports, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and typical for SDK transport setup. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided content.",
