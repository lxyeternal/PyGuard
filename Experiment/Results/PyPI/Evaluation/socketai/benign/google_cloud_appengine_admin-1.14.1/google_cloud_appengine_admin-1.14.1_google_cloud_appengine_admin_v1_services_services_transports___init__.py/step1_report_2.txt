  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for a service, supporting gRPC, gRPC AsyncIO, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dictionary initialization, and module-level variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; no data leaks or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; code simply sets up a registry of classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code features. The code is straightforward and typical for a transport registry.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and creates an ordered dictionary to register different transport implementations. It then exposes these classes via __all__ for external use. The licensing comments are standard and do not introduce any malicious behavior. The code is static, with no runtime data processing, external network activity, or obfuscated parts. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for registering transport classes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is typical infrastructure code for a client library setup.",
