{
  "purpose": "Define and register various transport classes for a service, facilitating different communication protocols (gRPC, gRPC AsyncIO, REST).",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present. No external data handling or network communication within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this code is mainly class registration and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed. The registry is statically populated with class references.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and classes, then creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes keyed by string identifiers. It also defines __all__ for export. No runtime data processing, no external inputs, no network activity, no credential handling, and no security-sensitive operations are present. It appears to be standard module setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for transport registration within a service SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
