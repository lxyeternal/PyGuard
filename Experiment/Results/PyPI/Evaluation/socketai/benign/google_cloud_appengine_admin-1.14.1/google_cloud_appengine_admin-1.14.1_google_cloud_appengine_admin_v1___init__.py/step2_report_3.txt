  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a module that imports and exports SDK classes/types for Google Cloud App Engine. The sources are trusted internal packages.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data; static import/export.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK module, with licensing and import statements, no dynamic code, no network activity, and no data handling. It appears safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing import/export for SDK classes and types.\n- No data processing, no network, no dynamic code.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Describes a module that initializes the SDK, importing classes/types, with no user input or network activity.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on import/export of SDK components, licensing, and structure.\n- No dynamic code, data flow, or external data handling.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, standard import/export for SDK classes.\n- No data processing, network, or dynamic code.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that this is a static module importing and exporting classes/types for SDK use.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n- **Risk assessment:** Since the code is purely structural, with no runtime logic, network activity, or data handling, the risk score should be **0**.\n- **Malware score:** Confirmed as **0** across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard SDK module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
