  "purpose": "This code serves as an SDK module for Google Cloud App Engine, primarily defining import statements and exporting classes/types for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from trusted Google Cloud packages and internal modules, with no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; static import/export statements only.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; the code does not process or transfer data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module index file that imports and re-exports SDK classes and types. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data processing. The licensing comments and structure are typical and from trusted sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat to supply chain security.",
