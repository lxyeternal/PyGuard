  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of comments (license, copyright, license URL) and a single variable assignment (`__version__ = \"1.14.1\"`).\n- No executable code, functions, data processing, input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The source of the code is only static comments and a straightforward variable assignment.\n- No data flows, sinks, or inputs/outputs are involved.\n- The code is typical for open-source project headers, with no anomalies or unusual patterns.\n- The confidence score is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty about benignity.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware scores are appropriate; no malicious activity is suggested.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The overall risk scores are 0, fitting given the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues found; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, emphasizing the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the assessments provided. The code is purely metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet. It is a standard license header and version declaration, common in open-source projects, with no security implications.",
