  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version identifier for an open-source project, providing licensing information and a version string.",
  "sources": "Comments containing licensing details and a variable assignment (__version__ = \"1.14.1\")",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows; static comments and a simple variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The content is typical for open-source headers, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and poses no security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
