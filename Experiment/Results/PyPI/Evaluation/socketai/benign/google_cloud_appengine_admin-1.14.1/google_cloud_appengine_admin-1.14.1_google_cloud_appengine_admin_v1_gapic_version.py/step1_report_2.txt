{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard license header and version declaration for a Python project, likely part of a larger open-source package.",
  "sources": "The only source of input is the static comments and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing, no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only contains comments and a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code consists solely of license comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, containing licensing information, copyright, and a version string assignment. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could be malicious. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The version variable is a straightforward string assignment with no dynamic or unsafe behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical license header and version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and standard for open-source projects.",
