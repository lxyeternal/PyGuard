  "purpose": "The provided code appears to be a header comment and metadata for a Python module or package, including licensing information and versioning.",
  "sources": "Comment blocks containing licensing info, version declaration (__version__ variable).",
  "sinks": "None present; no input or data output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow indicated; only metadata and comments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code; only licensing comments and version string. No suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comment blocks and a single variable assignment for versioning. No code that reads input, processes data, or interacts with external systems. No potential sources or sinks identified. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard license header and version declaration typically found in open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as documentation and metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
