  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python module header with licensing information and versioning, likely part of a larger project or library.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the file itself, primarily the comments and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions or code executing untrusted input or performing data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable, as there are no input or output operations or function calls.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The code is straightforward and typical of a license header.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only licensing comments and a version assignment, which are standard in open-source projects. There are no functions, data processing, or code execution paths that could indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard license and version comment block with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
