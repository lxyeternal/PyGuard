  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely metadata: comments, license headers, and a simple version string assignment.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malware or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Given the code's static nature and lack of executable logic, the malware score should be zero.\n   - All reports agree on the absence of malicious elements, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n3. **Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is straightforward and human-readable, with no obfuscation techniques used.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n4. **Security Risks:**\n   - No security risks are identified, as the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n   - The reports' conclusion of a zero security risk is justified.\n\n5. **Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - The confidence score is 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments:**\n   - No issues detected. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The assessments correctly interpret the code as standard license and version metadata with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, human-readable comments and straightforward assignment)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical open-source license header with a version string. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nNo changes needed. The scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
