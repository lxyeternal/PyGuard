  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Structure**:\n   - The code consists solely of comments (license, copyright, license URL).\n   - It contains a single assignment: `__version__ = \"1.14.1\"`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely metadata and licensing information.\n   - They uniformly conclude that there are no malicious elements, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n   - The confidence level in all reports is 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n   - They do not overreach or assume vulnerabilities beyond what the code can demonstrate.\n   - The reasoning is sound: static comments and a version string do not constitute security risks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis. No security issues are evident.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is a standard header file, typical in open-source projects.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n   - The scores are reasonable and align with the content.\n\n**My own assessment**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes**:\n- No further action needed.\n- This is a typical, safe license header file.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard open-source license and version declaration.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- Scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or additional analysis.",
