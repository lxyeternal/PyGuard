  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard Python package setup script.\n- The code reads version info from a local file (`gapic_version.py`) using regex, reads a README file, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is evident.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints, and no suspicious dependencies are included.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs typical setup tasks. No issues are present in terms of functionality or security.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security risks:** No evident security risks beyond standard package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports assume that regex-based version extraction is safe and benign, which is reasonable given the context.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made without evidence; all findings are consistent with legitimate package setup code.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. All reports agree on the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or higher would suggest a notable security concern. Since no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are identified, a score of **0** is justified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports uniformly assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the thoroughness and consistency.\n- No changes needed to scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It does not perform any dynamic or unsafe operations, does not handle untrusted input, and does not include any malicious dependencies or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
