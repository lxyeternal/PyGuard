  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The version extraction method via regex from a local file is typical and not inherently risky.\n- No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is evident.\n- Dependencies are well-defined with version constraints, and package discovery uses standard setuptools functions.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited maliciously.\n- The absence of any obfuscation or suspicious patterns supports the conclusion of safety.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified by the lack of any security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the regex-based version extraction, which is a common pattern and not a security concern.\n- No dynamic or external data is used in a way that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, safe package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and aligned with my analysis.",
