  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code only reads local files (version info and README) and calls `setuptools.setup()`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints, following best practices.\n- Version extraction uses regex on a local file, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended for a setup script. No issues with functionality or logic are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent. The script performs safe, standard package setup tasks.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only minor point is the regex used for version extraction, but it's a common pattern and only reads a local file. It doesn't introduce security issues.\n- No external inputs, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no security risk.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The version extraction method is standard.\n- Dependencies are well-defined, and no external or untrusted data is processed dynamically.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions.** The code is safe, legitimate, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the script and the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe setup script for a Python package with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and I agree with their assessments.",
