  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing comments and headers with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The comments and license headers serve as documentation; no data input or external sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as the code is purely comments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; only licensing boilerplate present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely licensing comments with no executable logic, data handling, or network interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the content. The code is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless licensing boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
