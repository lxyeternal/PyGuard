{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for validating SQL query syntax, specifically checking for forgotten semicolons, unbalanced parentheses, and unbalanced CASE statements.",
  "sources": "Reads input SQL query string `s` for analysis; uses functions like identify_create_table_view, count_lines, find_line_number, identify_in_sql from utils.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths to untrusted sources; primarily performs static analysis without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Processes input string `s` to identify syntax issues such as parentheses mismatch, unbalanced case-end pairs, or missing semicolons; no data is sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains autogenerated file indicators, but no suspicious obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static syntax validation on SQL queries by analyzing string content for matching parentheses, semicolons, and CASE-END blocks. It uses standard string processing and pattern matching, with no network or external data interactions. The functions rely on utility functions for line counting and position identification. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection, are present. The code's structure is straightforward and intended solely for syntax validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of SQL syntax validation functions without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs static analysis safely and as intended, with no evidence of malware, data leakage, or security threats.",
