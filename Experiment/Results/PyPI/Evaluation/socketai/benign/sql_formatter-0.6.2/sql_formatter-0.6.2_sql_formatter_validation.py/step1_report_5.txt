{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions for SQL query syntax, specifically checking for semicolons, balanced parentheses, and proper case-when structures.",
  "sources": "Input SQL query string `s` is read to analyze syntax correctness.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the functions do not execute or evaluate the input data beyond syntax validation.",
  "flows": "Input string `s` flows through various parsing and validation functions, which analyze for syntax errors without executing or modifying data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalous or suspicious code patterns; functions are straightforward syntax validators with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively implements syntax validation routines for SQL queries, including checking for multiple create statements, unbalanced parentheses, and proper case-end matching. All logic pertains to parsing and analyzing string structures, with no network, file, or system modifications. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code relies on utility functions imported from '.utils' but does not reveal their implementation here; assuming they perform safe, standard operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely for syntax validation of SQL queries. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. It appears to be a well-structured validation utility without security risks.",
