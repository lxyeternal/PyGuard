{
  "purpose": "This code provides validation functions for SQL query syntax, specifically checking for missing semicolons, unbalanced parentheses, and unbalanced CASE statements.",
  "sources": "Reads input SQL query string `s` in each validation function.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; functions only analyze and return validation results based on input strings.",
  "flows": "Input string `s` flows through parsing and analysis functions; no data is sent externally or to network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward and focus solely on syntax validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions and defines three validation functions. Each function analyzes the input string for specific SQL syntax issues: missing semicolons, unbalanced parentheses, and unbalanced CASE ... END blocks. All operations are string-based analyses with no external or network operations. No malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's purpose is to detect common SQL syntax errors, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs syntax validation for SQL queries with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe, well-scoped, and focused on syntax checking without side effects or external data handling.",
