{
  "purpose": "Provides validation functions for SQL query syntax, including checks for semicolons, balanced parentheses, and case-when blocks.",
  "sources": "Input SQL query string `s` read from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data output; primarily analysis of input string structure.",
  "flows": "Input string `s` flows through validation functions to produce validation reports with no data manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; functions perform straightforward syntax checks without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis on SQL query strings, checking for syntax issues such as multiple CREATE statements, unbalanced parentheses, and mismatched CASE-END blocks. It relies on helper functions for line counting and pattern identification. There is no evidence of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior. All operations are local and purely analytical, with no external side effects or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for SQL syntax validation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected based on this analysis.",
