  "purpose": "Static analysis functions for validating SQL query syntax, including checks for semicolons, balanced parentheses, and matching CASE-END blocks.",
  "sources": "Input string `s` read within each validation function; utility functions (`identify_create_table_view`, `count_lines`, `find_line_number`, `identify_in_sql`) used for pattern matching and line counting.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; functions perform purely static string analysis without external data flow or execution.",
  "flows": "Input string `s` flows through pattern matching and counting functions; no external or untrusted data flows into or out of the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static validation for SQL syntax issues such as multiple CREATE statements, unbalanced parentheses, and mismatched CASE-END blocks. It relies on external utility functions for pattern detection, which are assumed safe. The functions do not execute code or handle untrusted data beyond string parsing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, static SQL syntax validation functions with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and there are no security risks. The utility functions' safety is assumed, but even if they were compromised, the core validation functions are benign.",
