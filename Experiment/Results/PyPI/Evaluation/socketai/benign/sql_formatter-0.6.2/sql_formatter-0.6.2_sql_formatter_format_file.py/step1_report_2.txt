{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to format SQL commands and files, validating and cleaning up SQL syntax and formatting for readability and consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL content from files on disk; reads input strings containing SQL commands; reads command-line arguments for file paths and options.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted SQL back to the same files; outputs warnings and information to stdout; terminates process with exit codes if errors are detected.",
  "flows": "Reads SQL content from files -> validates and formats SQL content -> reports errors or warnings -> overwrites original files if formatting is successful.",
  "anomalies": "Contains redundant print statements and exit calls; uses abrupt termination with exit() on errors; no evident malicious code such as network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or hidden code features.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and custom modules, performs SQL validation, and reformats SQL queries for readability. It handles file I/O, string manipulations, and command-line interface parsing. It includes validation steps for semicolon placement, parentheses, and case statements, returning errors if issues are detected. The functions for formatting files include error reporting and warnings but do not execute any suspicious or harmful actions beyond file read/write and print statements. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of code injection, network activity, or hidden backdoors. Redundant print statements and abrupt exit() calls are present but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a utility for formatting and validating SQL files, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It mainly reads and writes files, validates SQL syntax, and reports issues, with no suspicious or harmful actions detected.",
