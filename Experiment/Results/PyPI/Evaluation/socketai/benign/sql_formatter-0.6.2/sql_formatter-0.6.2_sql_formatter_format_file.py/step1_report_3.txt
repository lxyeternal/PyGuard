{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to format SQL commands within files or strings, validate SQL syntax, and handle multiple files with optional recursion and line-length constraints.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL code from input strings or files, particularly in format_sql_file and format_sql_commands functions.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted SQL back to files in format_sql_file; displays warnings and errors via print statements.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files or strings (sources) -> processes and validates SQL -> potentially overwrites files with formatted content (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious comments detected. Uses standard libraries, no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious URL/network activity. The code performs validation and formatting with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and some project-specific modules. It contains functions to validate and format SQL queries, including handling semicolons, parentheses, and case statements. It performs validations to ensure syntax correctness before formatting. There are print statements for warnings and errors, and files are read and overwritten based on validation results. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious code logic observed. The code appears to be a standard utility for SQL formatting with proper validation and error handling. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a SQL formatter and validator with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not perform any harmful actions, data theft, or unauthorized system access. It strictly adheres to its purpose of formatting and validating SQL code, with proper error handling and user notifications.",
