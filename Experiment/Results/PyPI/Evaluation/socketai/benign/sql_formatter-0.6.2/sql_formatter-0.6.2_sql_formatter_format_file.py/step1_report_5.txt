{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to format SQL commands and files, including CLI support for batch processing of SQL scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads input SQL scripts from files specified via command-line arguments or glob patterns.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted SQL back to the same files, and performs validation checks that could output error messages or warnings.",
  "flows": "Reads SQL from files -> validates/formatting functions process SQL -> formatted SQL is written back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of regex and file I/O appears standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or hidden network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles reading, validating, and formatting SQL scripts, with safeguards against unbalanced parentheses, missing semicolons, and unbalanced CASE statements. It utilizes external modules for core, utils, and validation functions, but these are assumed to be safe as they are not detailed here. The code provides user interface via CLI for batch processing, and writes formatted results back to disk. No operations indicate malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network activity, or privilege escalation. The functions perform expected file and string manipulations, validations, and formatting tasks in a typical manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for SQL formatting with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. Its purpose is straightforward, with no suspicious data flows or security risks identified within the provided code.",
