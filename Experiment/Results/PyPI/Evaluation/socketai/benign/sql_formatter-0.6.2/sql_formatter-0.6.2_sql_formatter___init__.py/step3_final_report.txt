  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It involves no input/output, data processing, or external calls. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code poses no security threat and is standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
