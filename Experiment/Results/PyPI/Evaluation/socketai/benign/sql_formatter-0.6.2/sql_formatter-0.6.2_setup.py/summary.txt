  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. External file dependencies are typical and do not indicate malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate; I recommend setting the overall risk score to 0 for a more precise reflection of the benign nature."
