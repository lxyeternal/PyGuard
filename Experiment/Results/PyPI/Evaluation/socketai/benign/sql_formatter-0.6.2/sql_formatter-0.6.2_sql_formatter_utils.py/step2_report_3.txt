  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1**:  \n   - **Findings**: The report states \"Empty response\" with no details.  \n   - **Assessment**: No information is provided, so we cannot determine if issues are present.  \n   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities; this is just an empty report.\n\n2. **Reports 2-5**:  \n   - **Purpose & Sources**: All describe utility functions for parsing, formatting, and analyzing SQL queries, with regex-based string manipulations, comment handling, query splitting, etc.  \n   - **Sinks & Flows**: The functions manipulate strings, perform regex replacements, and analyze SQL syntax. No external system calls, network activity, or code execution are involved.  \n   - **Anomalies & Analysis**:  \n     - The code is consistent with standard SQL parsing and formatting utilities.  \n     - No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns.  \n     - Regex operations are used for parsing and substitution, which is typical in such utilities.  \n     - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external data handling.  \n     - The functions do not execute system commands, open network connections, or handle untrusted external input in a manner that could lead to exploitation.  \n   - **Conclusion**: The overall assessment across these reports is that the code is benign, intended for SQL query processing, and does not contain malicious or security-vulnerable patterns.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Risk Score**: Very low (around 0.1 to 0.2), justified by the absence of malicious behavior, but acknowledging that regex manipulations could be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted—though this is typical for such utilities.\n\n4. **Critical Evaluation**:  \n   - The functions are purely string processing with regex, comment handling, and query formatting.  \n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage.  \n   - The code does not perform any external actions that could be exploited maliciously.  \n   - The only potential concern is if untrusted input is processed without validation, regex-based substitutions could be misused, but this is standard in query parsing utilities.\n\n**Final Assessment & Recommendations**:  \n- The code is a collection of SQL query utilities with no malicious intent.  \n- The malware score should remain at **0**.  \n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.  \n- The overall security risk score should be **below 0.2**, given the potential for regex misuse with malicious input, but this is standard and not indicative of malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.1 (due to regex manipulation potential if inputs are malicious, but not actual vulnerability)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and intended for SQL query parsing and formatting. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident from the provided functions and their analysis.",
