{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing, formatting, and analyzing SQL queries, including comment handling, string manipulation, and query segmentation.",
  "sources": "Functions read input SQL strings, split into components, and perform regex-based substitutions and analyses.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or system modifications are present; operations are confined to string processing.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into components; regex operations modify or analyze these components; no external data flows or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard for SQL query handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of string parsing and formatting utilities for SQL queries, employing regex for comment detection, query splitting, and substitution. It does not perform any network activity, system calls, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The functions are designed for legitimate SQL query processing, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of SQL query utilities with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score reflects potential regex misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.",
