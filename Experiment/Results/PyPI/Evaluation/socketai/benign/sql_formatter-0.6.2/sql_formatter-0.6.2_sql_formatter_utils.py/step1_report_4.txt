{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing, formatting, and analyzing SQL queries, including string manipulations, comment handling, query splitting, and pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings `s` (SQL queries) for parsing, modification, or analysis. No external data sources or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex substitutions, string concatenation, and list manipulations to modify query strings. No direct data exfiltration, network operations, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through splitting (comments, quotes), pattern matching, and substitutions. No flow leads to untrusted data being sent externally or system commands executed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code focuses solely on SQL string processing with standard Python functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs string processing tasks: removing whitespaces, marking comments, splitting SQL queries, identifying specific patterns, and formatting queries. It employs regex for parsing and manipulation, and functions for string splitting based on comments, quotes, and SQL syntax. No signs of malicious intent such as network operations, file modifications, or data theft routines. All operations are confined to in-memory string processing relevant to SQL query analysis and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for SQL query handling with no malicious or sabotage elements. It does not include any network calls, system modifications, or malicious payloads. All functions are focused on query parsing, cleaning, and formatting, indicating a benign purpose.",
