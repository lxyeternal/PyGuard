  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying critical reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1: Empty response**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no details provided.\n- **Assessment:** Cannot evaluate; no information.\n\n**Conclusion:** No actionable insights; no scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes utility functions for SQL parsing, formatting, comment handling, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. Functions perform regex matching, string manipulations, parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior. The code operates purely on string parsing and formatting, with no system calls or external dependencies.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard SQL utility module. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks evident.\n\n**Scores suggested:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, due to regex manipulations that could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerability present)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to Report 2, emphasizing string processing, regex substitutions, comment handling, and formatting.\n- No external calls or system modifications.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9), but still no malware or security risk.\n\n**Scores suggested:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (again, potential if input is malicious, but no actual vulnerability)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on string manipulation, regex, comment handling, and query formatting.\n- No network or system calls.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- Operations are confined to string processing.\n\n**Scores suggested:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (or very close to zero)\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis: string parsing, regex operations, comment detection.\n- No external or system interactions.\n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores suggested:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (due to regex manipulations, but no actual vulnerability)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's operations.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the regex manipulations that could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, based on regex operations that could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Note:** Given the code's nature as a utility module for SQL parsing and formatting, and the absence of any external calls, network activity, or obfuscated code, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a set of SQL query processing utilities with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The minor risk score reflects potential misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1",
