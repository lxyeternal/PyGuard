  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine the actual security risk, malware potential, and obfuscation level.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states \"Empty response\" with no analysis.\n- **Findings:** No information provided; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence to suggest any issues. The report is essentially a placeholder.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** The functions are utility functions for SQL parsing and formatting, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:**  \n  - Uses regex for parsing and string manipulation only.\n  - No code execution, network activity, or external calls.\n  - No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving legitimate purposes.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** Very low, 0.0–0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 2, emphasizing string processing, regex operations, and comment handling.\n- **Analysis:**  \n  - No external data sources or system calls.\n  - Functions are standard for SQL string parsing and formatting.\n  - No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility functions, no malware or sabotage.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the functions' string manipulation, regex usage, and query restructuring.\n- **Analysis:**  \n  - No network, system, or external data interactions.\n  - Functions are for parsing, formatting, and analyzing SQL queries.\n  - No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility code with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing benign string and comment handling.\n- **Analysis:**  \n  - No external calls or system commands.\n  - Functions are standard for SQL query processing.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility functions.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Are any issues present in the code?**  \n- No. All reports agree that the code is a set of utility functions for SQL parsing, formatting, and analysis, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n**Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n- No. The reports are consistent and accurate based on the code provided.\n\n**Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n- Yes. All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n- No. All analyses are based on code review, regex usage, and string manipulation, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Is the malware score higher than 0.5?**  \n- No. All are 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward utility module for SQL query parsing and formatting. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0.  \n- No further action needed.",
