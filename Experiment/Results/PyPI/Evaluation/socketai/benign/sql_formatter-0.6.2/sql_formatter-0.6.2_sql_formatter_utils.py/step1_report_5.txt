{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing, analyzing, and manipulating SQL queries and strings, including comment handling, splitting, and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input strings `s` (SQL queries and text), regex patterns, environment variables (not explicitly present in code), input parameters for functions.",
  "sinks": "Replacements and modifications in string `s`, regex substitutions, string concatenations, comment/quote detection, query restructuring, line/position calculations.",
  "flows": "Input strings → split_comment_quote or split_query functions → regex-based substitutions or string modifications → output strings with altered structure or comments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code; the code performs extensive string parsing and regex-based modifications which could be misused if inputs are maliciously crafted, but no suspicious behaviors like network connections or data exfiltration are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a collection of utilities for SQL query analysis, comment parsing, string cleaning, and formatting. Functions like `mark_ci_comments`, `split_query`, and `sub_in_sql` handle SQL syntax elements and comments without executing external code or network operations. The functions mainly perform regex substitutions, string splits, and analysis. There are no apparent sources of untrusted external input aside from the strings passed to functions, and no sinks involve network or file I/O, system commands, or other potentially malicious actions. The code does not contain obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution. It is designed for query analysis and formatting, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive utility module for SQL query processing, with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions solely on string manipulation, comment handling, and query formatting, with no signs of malware or data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears benign and aligned with its stated purpose.",
