{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a static metadata module for a Python project, defining exported symbols, an index mapping, module list, documentation URLs, and a placeholder function for custom documentation links.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines static variables, dictionaries, lists, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static definitions with no dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and auto-generated metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated module containing only variable definitions, URLs, and a simple function returning None. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The URLs are publicly accessible documentation and repository links. No malicious or suspicious elements are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static project metadata with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
