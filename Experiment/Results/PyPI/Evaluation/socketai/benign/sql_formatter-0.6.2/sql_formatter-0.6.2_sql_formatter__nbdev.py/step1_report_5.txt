  "purpose": "This code defines the structure and metadata for an auto-generated Python project related to SQL formatting, including module lists, index mappings, and URLs.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or user inputs are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code only contains static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The URLs are publicly accessible documentation and repository links, not malicious or hidden.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, setting up metadata such as module filenames, index mappings, and URLs. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external system interactions are present. It appears to be boilerplate for documentation or project configuration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is safe and non-malicious. It simply establishes metadata and references for a Python project related to SQL formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
