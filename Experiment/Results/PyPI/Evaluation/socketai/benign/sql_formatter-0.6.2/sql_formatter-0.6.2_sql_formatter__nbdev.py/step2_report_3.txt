  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a static Python module primarily defining:\n     - `__all__` for exports.\n     - An `index` dictionary mapping logical names to notebook filenames.\n     - A `modules` list of module filenames.\n     - URLs for documentation (`doc_url`) and source repository (`git_url`).\n     - A placeholder function `custom_doc_links`.\n   - The code contains no dynamic logic, input/output handling, network operations, or data processing.\n   - It appears to be auto-generated metadata for a project.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No handling of sensitive data, secrets, or external inputs.\n   - The URLs are publicly accessible links, not malicious or hidden.\n   - The function `custom_doc_links` simply returns `None`, indicating no hidden or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and benign.\n   - They consistently identify the code as project metadata, with no input handling, no data leaks, and no malicious intent.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are noted.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and all scores for malware and security risk are zero.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports; justified as there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0; no security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent; no adjustments needed.\n   - Since the code is purely static metadata, assigning any risk higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, static project metadata.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The scores should remain at zero for malware and risk.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, auto-generated metadata module with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
