  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, correctness, and to verify that the scores align with the content.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static, auto-generated metadata for a Python project related to SQL formatting.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic behavior is mentioned.\n- The code consists solely of variable definitions, lists, URLs, and a simple function returning None.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no errors, flaws, or suspicious logic. The reports correctly identify that it is static metadata.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n\n- **Flow and sinks:**  \n  No data flows or sinks involving untrusted data are present, as expected.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**1. Validity of scores:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- Security risk score is 0, consistent with no dynamic or sensitive operations.\n\n**2. Reasonableness of risk scores (>0.5):**  \n- No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n\n**3. Any assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n- All reports correctly state that the code is static and does not handle untrusted data or perform malicious actions.\n\n**4. Consistency of the analysis:**  \n- The conclusions in each report are consistent and justified based on the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and auto-generated project metadata.\n- No anomalies or suspicious elements are detected.\n- The URLs provided are public documentation and repository links, not malicious or obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nGiven all this, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, static metadata with no security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, consistent, and justified. No modifications needed. The code poses no security threat.",
