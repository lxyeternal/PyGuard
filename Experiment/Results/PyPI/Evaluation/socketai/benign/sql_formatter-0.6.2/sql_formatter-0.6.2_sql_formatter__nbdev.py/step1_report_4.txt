{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata, including exports, data structures, and documentation URLs for a Python package related to SQL formatting.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only declares static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments and function definitions with no runtime input handling, no external data processing, and no code that could be used for malicious purposes. The presence of auto-generated comments and URLs suggests it is boilerplate for documentation and module listing. There are no obfuscation techniques, no malicious behaviors, and no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated module definition file with no malicious or security concerns. It simply lists module metadata, documentation links, and does not process or handle untrusted data.",
