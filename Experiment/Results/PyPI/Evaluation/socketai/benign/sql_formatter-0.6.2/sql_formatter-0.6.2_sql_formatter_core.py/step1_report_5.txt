{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for cleaning, formatting, and manipulating SQL query strings, primarily for beautification and standardization purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input strings representing SQL queries; there are no external data sources or inputs outside the parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include regex substitutions that modify query strings, but these are for formatting purposes only and do not directly execute or evaluate untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through multiple functions: cleaning, splitting, comment handling, formatting, and reassembly. No data is read from or written to external sources, and there are no network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code performs purely text-based transformations without any hidden or malicious logic. There are no obfuscated code patterns, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions for cleaning and formatting SQL queries. It uses regex and string operations to manipulate the query structure, comments, and whitespace for readability. All operations are confined to string transformations with no external or system interaction. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. The purpose aligns with SQL query formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of SQL formatting functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility aimed at improving SQL query readability and structure.",
