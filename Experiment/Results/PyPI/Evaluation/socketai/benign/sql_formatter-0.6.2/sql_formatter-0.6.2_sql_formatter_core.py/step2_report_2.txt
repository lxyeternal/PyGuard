  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, the scoring rationale, and the potential for malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive SQL query formatter, involving string manipulation, regex-based parsing, comment handling, and line formatting.\n- It operates solely on input strings, with no network, file, or system command execution.\n- The functions are designed for beautification, standardization, and readability enhancement.\n- No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The regex patterns and string operations are typical for formatting tools.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** SQL formatting utility.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; purely string manipulation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a standard SQL formatter with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** SQL beautification and standardization.\n- **Analysis:** No external data transmission or malicious logic.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, focused on formatting.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Parsing and formatting SQL queries.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns; regex for formatting only.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** SQL beautification.\n- **Analysis:** String transformations only; no external interactions.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SQL formatting.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; safe string operations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Summary\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code performs only string parsing and formatting.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No significant errors. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present. The risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Why risk scores are 0?**  \n  Because the code does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code patterns.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  The code is purely for formatting; regex patterns are standard and used within the scope of string manipulation.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent without evidence. They recognize the functions' purpose and scope.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate SQL formatting utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. The detailed analysis confirms that the functions are safe and serve a standard purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure input validation if used in untrusted environments, but as a formatting utility, the current implementation is safe.",
