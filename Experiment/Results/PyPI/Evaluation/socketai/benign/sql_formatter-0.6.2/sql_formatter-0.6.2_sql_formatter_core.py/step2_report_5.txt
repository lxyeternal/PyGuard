  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, correctness of scoring, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a SQL formatter, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, high confidence.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent, as no security issues are evident.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a benign SQL formatting utility. No issues detected.  \n- **Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above—SQL beautifier, no malicious activity, high confidence.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — aligns with the code's behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no hidden malicious logic or obfuscation.  \n- **Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion—legitimate SQL parsing/formatting, no malicious activity.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly interprets the code's purpose and security posture.  \n- **Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a SQL beautifier with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- **Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—utility functions for SQL formatting, benign.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — aligns with the code's functionality.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden payloads. The code solely performs string manipulation and regex-based formatting.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward, non-obfuscated nature.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security threat.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a set of SQL formatting and cleaning functions. It operates purely on string inputs, employing regex and string manipulations to enhance readability and structure.\n- There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n- The functions do not execute external commands or access system resources beyond string processing.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's actual behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured SQL formatter with no security concerns.",
