{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of functions aimed at formatting, cleaning, and manipulating SQL queries for better readability and structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, particularly SQL query strings (`s`) passed to various formatting functions, and from internal regex pattern matching and string splitting functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is processed without sanitization, particularly in regex substitutions or string concatenations, but no explicit data exfiltration or network communication occurs. No sensitive data is read, stored, or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings (sources) are processed through cleaning, formatting, and reformatting functions (flow), ultimately producing a formatted SQL query output. No external data sinks or network operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials are present. The code is well-structured with regex-based parsing and formatting routines, typical for SQL query formatting tools. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a SQL formatter and cleaner, employing regex and string manipulation to improve SQL query readability. It does not perform any network operations, access system files, or execute code dynamically. All functions operate solely on provided string inputs and produce formatted strings, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects. The use of regex is appropriate for formatting purposes and does not pose security risks. The functions do not handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to injection or data leakage beyond normal string processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SQL formatting utility with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain security threats. It processes input queries for better readability and structure without any harmful side effects or malicious intent.",
