  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a set of functions for cleaning and formatting SQL queries, primarily reading input strings and regex pattern matching.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; the flow is internal string manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution. The code operates solely on string inputs, performing formatting.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SQL formatter, no malicious intent or security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focused on SQL beautification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no code injection, no malicious payloads. Regex and string operations are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility for SQL formatting, no security issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, for parsing and beautifying SQL queries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or system commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic; purely string manipulation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility, no malware or security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on beautification and restructuring of SQL code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication, just internal string processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious payloads, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SQL formatter, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, string-based SQL beautification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system interaction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or network operations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the purely string manipulation nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and align with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary statement:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured SQL formatting utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and accurate.",
