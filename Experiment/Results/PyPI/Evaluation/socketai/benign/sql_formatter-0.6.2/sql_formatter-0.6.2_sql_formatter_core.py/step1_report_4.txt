{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for cleaning, formatting, and parsing SQL queries, primarily for SQL query beautification and restructuring.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as string `s`, especially SQL query strings, and also from regex matches within those strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include regex substitutions that modify query strings, but no direct untrusted data output or system commands are present. No file operations, network connections, or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "Input SQL query strings are processed through cleaning, formatting, and restructuring functions, with regex operations transforming query structure. Data flows are internal transformations within string variables; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation, are observed. All regex patterns and string manipulations are standard for SQL formatting purposes. No signs of malicious logic or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple functions dedicated to SQL query formatting, including cleaning, reformatting long lines, and restructuring query components. It uses regex extensively for parsing and modifying strings but only within the scope of formatting. There are no indications of malicious code, external system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions operate solely on input strings and produce formatted SQL code, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SQL formatter and beautifier, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates purely on string transformations for formatting purposes, with no external communication, data leaks, or backdoors detected.",
