{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for cleaning, formatting, and restructuring SQL queries through string manipulation and regex-based parsing, aimed at improving readability and structure.",
  "sources": "Input strings representing SQL queries, read and processed via regex matching, splitting, and substitution functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or system calls; operations are confined to string outputs.",
  "flows": "SQL query strings are input; functions perform regex-based parsing, comment handling, and formatting; output is a reformatted SQL string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; standard regex and string operations are used for formatting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code operates solely on string inputs, applying regex and string manipulation functions to format SQL queries. No external system interactions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. The functions handle comments, quotes, and SQL syntax to produce a cleaner, more readable query. The absence of hardcoded credentials, network calls, or malicious logic indicates benign intent. The code's purpose aligns with standard SQL beautification tools, and no anomalies or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SQL formatting utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk score to 0, consistent with the analysis.",
