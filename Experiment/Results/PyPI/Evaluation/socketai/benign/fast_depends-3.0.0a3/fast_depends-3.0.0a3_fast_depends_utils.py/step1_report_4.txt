{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for running asynchronous functions, handling context managers in async and sync environments, inspecting call signatures, and managing local variables for dynamic function evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads function parameters, global and local variables via inspect and context frames, and input data from asynchronous iterables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include execution of arbitrary functions via run_async and run_in_threadpool, context manager entry/exit, and dynamic evaluation of annotations. No direct sinks like network or file operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources such as function parameters and global/local variables flow into signature inspection and annotation evaluation; these feed into function execution and context management functions, which execute user-defined callables and context managers. No external data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code relies on standard libraries and well-known patterns for async management, signature parsing, and context handling. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a utility module for async function execution, context management, and signature inspection. It carefully handles coroutine, generator, and async generator functions, wrapping context managers for threadpool execution, and unwrapping function signatures with annotations. All operations use standard Python features without suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors. No data leaks, malicious data transmission, or credential harvesting evident. The code is well-structured and intended for general asynchronous operation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for async execution and signature handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The code appears safe for use in production environments.",
