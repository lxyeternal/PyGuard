  "purpose": "Utility functions for asynchronous execution, context management, and function signature introspection in Python.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, global and local variables, function annotations, and context managers.",
  "sinks": "Execution of callables, context managers, and signature evaluation; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source data (function args, globals, locals, annotations) flows into function calls, context managers, and signature processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python libraries and patterns for async control flow, reflection, and context management. It handles unwrapping callables, managing context managers in threads, and inspecting function signatures with support for forward references. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The functions are designed for dependency injection or async workflows, which are common and safe. The high confidence scores (around 0.9-1) and zero malware scores across all reports are justified. The low security risk (~0.2) reflects minimal potential for misuse, mainly due to dynamic invocation features, but no actual malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for async execution and introspection. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and appropriate given the code's nature.",
