{
  "purpose": "Define abstract and protocol classes for data serialization with configurable options.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external data interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up class structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up class definitions for OptionItem, Serializer (abstract base class), and SerializerProto (protocol). It manages data structures for serialization options and response types without performing any data processing or external interactions. No potentially malicious behaviors or security risks are evident. The code appears purely structural and intended for use as part of a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines structural classes for serialization with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no external input handling, network activity, or suspicious code segments. The code appears safe and non-malicious.",
