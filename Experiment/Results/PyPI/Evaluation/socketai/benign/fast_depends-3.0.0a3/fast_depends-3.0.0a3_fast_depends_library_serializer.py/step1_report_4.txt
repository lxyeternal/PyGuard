  "purpose": "Define abstract and protocol classes for serializing data with configurable options.",
  "sources": "No input sources detected; code defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for OptionItem, Serializer, and a Protocol interface SerializerProto. It mainly sets up data structures and abstract methods for future implementation. There are no external data inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors. No network activity, code injection, or malicious operations are present. The code appears to be standard framework code for data serialization, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious setup for serialization abstractions and protocols. No security threats or malicious behaviors are identified.",
