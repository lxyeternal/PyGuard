{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base class and protocol for serialization with configurable options.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from class attributes, constructor parameters, and method calls. No external input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data outputs are evident; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and method parameters, with no untrusted source to sink paths. The code primarily sets up data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears standard for a serialization framework.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract serializer framework with an OptionItem class for configurable options. It uses standard Python features like dataclasses, type hints, and ABC/Protocol for structure. No external input reading, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The design is typical for extensible serialization, with no signs of malicious logic or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward framework for serialization with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears benign and focused on defining structures for serialization tasks.",
