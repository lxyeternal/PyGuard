{
  "purpose": "The function `build_call_model` constructs a CallModel object for a given callable, analyzing its parameters, dependencies, serialization, and validation logic for use in dependency injection or framework orchestration.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to `build_call_model`, especially `call`, `dependency_provider`, `extra_dependencies`, and parameter annotations.",
  "sinks": "Use of `deepcopy`, `get_typed_signature`, `build_call_model` (recursion), and `dependency_provider` methods (add_dependant, get_dependant). No direct data leaks or external network calls are visible.",
  "flows": "Inputs (call, dependencies, annotations) are processed to create dependency models and validate constraints. Dependencies are added via `dependency_provider`. The final `CallModel` aggregates all dependencies, parameters, and configuration for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. Use of assertions to enforce constraints is standard. Recursive calls to build dependency models are safe assuming external code is secure. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes function parameters, managing annotations, defaults, and dependency injection objects. It enforces constraints on async/sync usage and custom annotations, constructs dependency models recursively, and prepares a call configuration object. No signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated code are present. Usage of deep copying and dependency registration appears standard within a dependency injection framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a dependency injection or API framework, with no evidence of malicious intent. It performs parameter analysis, dependency registration, and configuration setup securely. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are detected.",
