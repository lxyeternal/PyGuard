{
  "purpose": "This code builds a CallModel object representing a dependency-injected callable, handling annotations, dependencies, and serialization options.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (typed_params.parameters), dependency annotations (Dependant, CustomField), default values, and function attributes (e.g., __name__).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dependency injection points where dependency models are built, and where dependency_provider methods are called. No direct data leaks or untrusted data processing are evident.",
  "flows": "Function parameters are analyzed and depending on their annotations and defaults, dependencies and custom fields are created. These are assembled into a CallModel which manages the dependencies and call details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified. The code appears to be a standard dependency builder with validation assertions. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured introspection of a callable, handling annotations, default values, and special types like Dependant and CustomField. It creates dependency models, manages serialization, and assembles all info into a CallModel object. All operations are typical for dependency injection systems. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious logic, or covert behavior. The assertions ensure correct usage but do not introduce security issues. No external network calls or dangerous eval-like functions are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard component for dependency injection with no signs of malicious behavior. It securely processes function signatures and manages dependencies. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
