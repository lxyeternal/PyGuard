{
  "purpose": "The code re-exports selected components from the 'fast_depends' library for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'fast_depends.dependencies', 'fast_depends.exceptions', and 'fast_depends.use' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules and defines an export list without any data flow, input handling, or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from an external library and defines an export list. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external communications. It appears to be a straightforward module re-export without any suspicious behavior. The minimal code and direct imports suggest no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple re-export of dependencies from a third-party library and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a public interface module for dependency injection and validation components, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
