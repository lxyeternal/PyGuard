{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface for importing specific classes and functions related to dependency management, validation, and dependency injection from the 'fast_depends' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes and functions from 'fast_depends.dependencies', 'fast_depends.exceptions', and 'fast_depends.use'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable: the code only imports modules and assigns to __all__, with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from an external library. It declares '__all__' for module exports. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or suspicious constructs. The dependencies appear standard for a dependency injection framework, and no malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions solely as a module interface for dependency management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet.",
