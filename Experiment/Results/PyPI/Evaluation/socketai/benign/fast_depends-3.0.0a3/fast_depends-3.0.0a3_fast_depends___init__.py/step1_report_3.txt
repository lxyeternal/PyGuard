  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from the fast_depends package for dependency injection and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'fast_depends' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, importing known modules and re-exporting them. No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from the 'fast_depends' package and defines an export list. There are no dynamic code execution, hidden behavior, or data handling that could be malicious. All imported modules are standard for dependency management and validation. The code structure is clean and typical for a module re-export file. No anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module that re-exports selected components from 'fast_depends' for easier access. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks evident in this snippet.",
