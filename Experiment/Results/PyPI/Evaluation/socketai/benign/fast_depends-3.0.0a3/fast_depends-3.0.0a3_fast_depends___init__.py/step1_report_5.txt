  "purpose": "To import dependency injection utilities and exceptions from the 'fast_depends' package for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'fast_depends' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; import statements are static code.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static import only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions ('Provider', 'ValidationError', 'Depends', 'inject') from the 'fast_depends' package, and defines the __all__ list to specify exported symbols. The code appears straightforward, using standard import syntax. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. It does not include any hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The structure is simple and aligns with typical Python module practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard imports from a known dependency injection library with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
