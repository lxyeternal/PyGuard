  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code snippet:**\n\n- The code consists solely of import statements from the 'fast_depends' library and an `__all__` declaration.\n- There are no data flows, no dynamic code execution, no network or file operations.\n- The code is straightforward, serving as a module interface or re-export file.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The purpose appears to be to centralize exports for dependency injection and validation utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed facts:\n- The code is benign.\n- No malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very close) are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; straightforward imports, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; re-exporting dependencies, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The slight securityRisk score might be conservative but acceptable given the context.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Identical pattern; simple import and export.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as previous; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same; standard import pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, should be 0 or very close to 0, as in the reports.\n\n**Any higher scores would be unjustified** unless additional context or code snippets indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, benign module re-export with no security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\nAll reports correctly reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.",
