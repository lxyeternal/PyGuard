{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that re-exports specific classes and functions from the 'fast_depends' library, facilitating dependency injection and validation utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the import statements of 'fast_depends.dependencies', 'fast_depends.exceptions', and 'fast_depends.use'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code only imports and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the imported modules into the namespace, then into the __all__ export list; no untrusted data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific components from the 'fast_depends' library and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk and malware scores are justified by the code's simplicity. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the likelihood of obfuscation or malicious intent is very low (0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
