  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling Python type annotations, especially forward references and newer typing features across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads package version info via importlib.metadata, imports conditional modules, and accesses attributes of types like typing.ForwardRef.",
  "sinks": "Uses eval_type_backport and eval_type_backport.eval_type_backport, which evaluate string representations of types; eval_type_backport may execute code if imported or used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input string annotations → _make_forward_ref or eval_type_backport → eval_type_backport.eval_type_backport (potential code execution if eval_type_backport.eval_type_backport evaluates untrusted input).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses conditional imports and dynamic evaluation but within legitimate compatibility scope.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility for type annotation features across Python versions, employing eval and conditional imports. The eval_type_backport.eval_type_backport call is the only potential risk point; however, it is used for evaluating type annotations, which is typical in such utility modules. No malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The code does not perform any network or system modifications, and third-party libraries are used as intended for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, version-compatible utility for handling type annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The potential risk is limited to the eval_type_backport.eval_type_backport call, which is a controlled utility function for type evaluation, not executing arbitrary code from untrusted sources.",
