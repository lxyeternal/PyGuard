{
  "purpose": "The code manages compatibility for importing and using ExceptionGroup and evaluates forward references in type annotations with fallbacks for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, and function definitions that read module metadata, sys.version_info, and local variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential eval calls in evaluate_forwardref and eval_type_backport functions, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious input is provided.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data could flow into evaluate_forwardref's 'value' parameter, which may be evaluated via eval_type_backport or eval_type, leading to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() in evaluate_forwardref without explicit sandboxing; reliance on third-party packages like eval_type_backport without validation; dynamic import logic based on version info.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules, determines environment compatibility, and defines functions for safe type evaluation with fallbacks. The key risk lies in evaluate_forwardref, which uses eval_type_backport or eval_type that internally call eval() on user-provided 'value'. The code appears to be designed for compatibility and does not include hardcoded secrets or backdoors. However, the use of eval() introduces a significant security risk if 'value' is untrusted. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present; the code's structure suggests legitimate purpose, but the eval pattern can be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for compatibility in type annotation handling, but the use of eval() on input data constitutes a high-security risk if inputs are untrusted. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident outside the eval usage. Overall, it is not intentionally malicious but contains a potentially dangerous pattern (eval).",
