{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling Python type annotations, especially forward references and newer typing features, ensuring compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, typing, importlib.metadata), conditional imports of external modules (anyio, exceptiongroup, eval_type_backport), and functions that evaluate or manipulate type annotations.",
  "sinks": "eval_type_backport calls, eval_type_backport import, and eval_type_backport function invocation could potentially execute untrusted code if malicious input is supplied, but in practice, they operate on type annotations, not user data.",
  "flows": "Type annotation strings or objects are passed to evaluate_forwardref or eval_type_backport, which may call eval_type_backport, potentially executing code if malicious input is provided as a type annotation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hidden code, or unusual language features are present. The code relies heavily on standard Python features and conditional imports. The eval_type_backport import is optional and may introduce a fallback, but this is typical for compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a compatibility layer for handling Python type annotations across various versions. It conditionally imports modules based on environment and Python version, and provides functions to evaluate or create forward references and handle newer typing syntax. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The eval_type_backport import is optional and only used for fallback in type evaluation, not executing untrusted code. The code does not include any network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Its purpose is solely to facilitate type handling in a backward-compatible manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility for Python typing features and does not contain malicious behavior. It operates within the bounds of standard Python library and known external packages, without any indicators of sabotage or malware. No security risks are identified beyond typical compatibility considerations.",
