  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling type annotations and ensuring compatibility across different Python versions, including conditional imports and safe evaluation of type expressions.",
  "sources": "Conditional import statements, eval_type_backport calls, and string-based type annotations.",
  "sinks": "eval() calls within evaluate_forwardref and eval_type_backport, which evaluate 'value' or type strings potentially containing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' (possibly a string or forward reference) is processed and passed to eval_type_backport.eval_type_backport, which may evaluate code if 'value' is a string representing a type.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on 'value' in evaluate_forwardref and eval_type_backport, which could execute arbitrary code if 'value' is untrusted; no other suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages type annotation evaluation and compatibility across Python versions. The use of eval() in evaluate_forwardref and eval_type_backport is standard for type evaluation but inherently risky if inputs are untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is moderate (~0.2), reflecting eval()'s potential danger, but in typical controlled environments, this pattern is accepted. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for type handling and version compatibility, with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the use of eval() on potentially untrusted data, which should be used cautiously. The scores are appropriate, with a moderate security risk due to eval().",
