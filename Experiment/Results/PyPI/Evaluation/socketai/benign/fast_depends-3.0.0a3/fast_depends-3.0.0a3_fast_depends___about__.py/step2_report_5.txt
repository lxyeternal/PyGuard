  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting solely of a docstring and a version assignment. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external interactions. Therefore, there are no issues or vulnerabilities present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious content.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. There's no obfuscation present.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of executable logic or external data handling.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely metadata with no active logic, higher scores are unwarranted. The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and match the content's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward package metadata snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the security aspects.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All scores are correctly assigned as zero.",
