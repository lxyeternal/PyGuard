{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for the FastDepends package, likely used for dependency injection in FastAPI applications.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only metadata assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or processing",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement; purely static assignment",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only version string; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a docstring describing the package and a version assignment. No runtime logic, input handling, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The content appears straightforward and typical for a package metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving only as a metadata declaration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
