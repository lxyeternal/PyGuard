  "sources": "No input sources; static string assignment (__version__ = \"3.0.0a3\") and docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a module docstring and a version string assignment, with no functions, imports, or executable logic. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The code serves purely as metadata. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. Scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, metadata-only, and poses no security threat. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
