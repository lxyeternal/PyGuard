  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a version string; no suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header containing a descriptive comment and a version string. It lacks any functional or executable code, input handling, or network interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign code fragment serving as metadata for the package. It does not contain malware or security threats.",
