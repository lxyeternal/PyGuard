  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\nFirst, examining the code snippet: \n\n```python\n\"\"\"FastDepends - extracted and cleared from HTTP domain FastAPI Dependency Injection System\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"3.0.0a3\"\n```\n\nThis is a straightforward module with only a docstring and a version string assignment. There are no functions, no imports, no data processing, no network interactions, and no code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n\nNow, reviewing each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all agree that the code is minimal, metadata-only, with no suspicious activity, and no signs of obfuscation or malware. They consistently assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Logical assessment:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code contains only static data (a version string) and a descriptive comment.\n- There are no data flows, sinks, or sources that could be exploited.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is benign and standard for package metadata.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated score: all reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- Security risk: all reports assign 0, consistent with the code content.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n\n- No issues are present; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is safe, with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the unanimous agreement across reports, I concur with their conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
