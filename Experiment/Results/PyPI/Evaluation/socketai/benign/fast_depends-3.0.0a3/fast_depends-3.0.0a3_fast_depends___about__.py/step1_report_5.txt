  "purpose": "Metadata indicating the package name and version for a FastAPI dependency injection system.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable; no data input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; code is only defining a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code logic, functions, or data handling; only metadata present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment and a version variable assignment. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. No source or sink points are present, and the code appears to be an initial module declaration or metadata snippet. No malicious or suspicious activity can be inferred from this minimal code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard package version identifier without any harmful content.",
