{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for validation errors related to options handling in the fast_depends library, primarily for error reporting and messaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'incoming_options' parameter and the 'expected' dictionary, as well as from the 'locations' sequence and 'original_error' exception.",
  "sinks": "The code formats and constructs error messages for string output, but does not perform any data sinks that could leak data externally or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input data ('incoming_options', 'expected', 'locations') is processed to create error messages. No execution flow involves external data or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed. Exception handling and string formatting are straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, 'FastDependsError' and 'ValidationError'. 'ValidationError' captures details about validation failures, including the original error, options, and expected types, and formats these into a descriptive message. No external data sources, network calls, or code execution is present. The code adheres to typical Python exception patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of custom error classes used for validation error reporting within a library. No malicious intent, no malicious behavior, and no security risks are evident.",
