  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for validation error reporting, capturing details about incoming options, expected types, and error locations.",
  "sources": "Parameters: incoming_options, locations, expected, original_error used in __str__ for message formatting.",
  "sinks": "Formatted string in __str__ that includes untrusted input data (incoming_options) for error messages.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into exception object; used in string formatting for error message output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception pattern, safe string formatting, no obfuscation or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for validation errors. It captures relevant data and formats it into a message. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The use of untrusted input in error messages is typical, with minimal security concern since no code execution or data leaks occur. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
