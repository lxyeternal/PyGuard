{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for validation errors within the FastDepends library, specifically handling incoming options and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads from the incoming_options parameter, expected dictionary of OptionItem objects, and locations list.",
  "sinks": "Generates error message string in __str__, which may include data from incoming_options.",
  "flows": "incoming_options and locations are used to build the error message, with no untrusted data flow leading to system or network effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception hierarchy for validation errors, processing input data for error reporting. It uses data from incoming_options and expected dictionaries to generate descriptive error messages. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. The use of string joins and formatting is standard and safe. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception handling for validation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
