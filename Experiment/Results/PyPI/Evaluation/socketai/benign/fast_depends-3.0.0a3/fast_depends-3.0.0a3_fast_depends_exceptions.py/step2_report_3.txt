  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines two exception classes:\n  - `FastDependsError`: a base exception class.\n  - `ValidationError`: inherits from `ValueError` and `FastDependsError`, capturing validation failure details, including incoming options, error locations, expected options, and the original error.\n- The `__str__` method formats a human-readable error message, including the incoming options and the types of options where the error occurred.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No, the code appears straightforward, with no bugs or vulnerabilities. It uses standard exception handling and safe string formatting.\n\n- **Malicious code or obfuscation?**  \n  No, the code does not contain obfuscated patterns, dynamic code execution, network calls, or secrets.\n\n- **Untrusted input handling?**  \n  The `incoming_options` and `locations` are used for message formatting. Since these are used only in string formatting, and no code execution or data leaks are evident, this seems safe.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Review:\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The logic is sound: capturing validation errors with context and formatting them for display.  \n  The only minor point is that `self.error_fields` defaults to all expected options if no specific locations are provided, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close, and confidence=1. This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  No, all are 0 or very low (0.1). Given the benign code, this is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The only concern might be if `incoming_options` contains untrusted data that could cause issues when converted to string. However, since it's only formatted into a string for display, and no code execution occurs, this is not a security risk.\n\n- **Malicious activity?**  \n  No. The code is purely for error reporting.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for validation errors.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent** with the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is safe, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
