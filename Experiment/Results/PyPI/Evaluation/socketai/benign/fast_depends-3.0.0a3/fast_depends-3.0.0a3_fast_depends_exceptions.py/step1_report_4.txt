{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for handling validation errors in a dependency management context, specifically for serializing options and reporting errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the incoming_options parameter and the expected dictionary, as well as the locations list to determine error fields.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method formats and outputs string representations of the data, potentially including untrusted input in the error message.",
  "flows": "Data flows from incoming_options and locations into error_fields; then, in __str__, data flows into string formatting for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, no file operations, and no obfuscated code are present. The code solely performs data handling and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with no suspicious behavior. It processes input data for error reporting, uses safe string formatting, and relies on standard Python exception inheritance. No malicious or maliciously misleading code is evident. There are no suspicious data leaks, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for validation error reporting. It contains no malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
