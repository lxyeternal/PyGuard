{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for validation errors within a dependency management or configuration validation system, specifically in the context of the fast_depends library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported modules and the parameters passed to the ValidationError class (__init__ method).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data influences system behavior in a harmful manner; the code only processes and formats data for error messages.",
  "flows": "Input data (incoming_options, locations, expected, original_error) flows into the error class, primarily used for generating descriptive error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code uses standard exception handling and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes to handle validation errors, including data collection and string representation for debugging. No external data is fetched, no network operations, no code execution, and no use of dynamic code evaluation. It relies on standard library imports and a specific OptionItem type. All data flows are internal, with no indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom validation exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages and reports validation errors with no external or harmful effects.",
