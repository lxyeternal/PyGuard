{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for validation errors related to dependency options in a fast dependency management system.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from 'incoming_options' and 'locations' parameters, which are provided during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method formats and outputs data from 'incoming_options' and 'error_fields', which could potentially include untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data from 'incoming_options' and 'locations' flows into the string representation, where it is formatted for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external network interactions. Use of standard exception class inheritance and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, 'FastDependsError' and 'ValidationError', used for error handling in dependency validation contexts. The 'ValidationError' captures details about the incoming options and expected types, formatting them for output in __str__. The formatting involves string joins and dictionary item iteration, which are standard. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. No untrusted input is processed in a dangerous way, and no external communication or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with safe string formatting. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears secure and benign.",
