{
  "purpose": "The code is exporting components ('CallModel' and 'build_call_model') from local modules for external use, likely for building or utilizing a call model.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules '.builder' and '.model' to import specific classes/functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: importing specific components from local modules; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behaviors are present; the code is standard module export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports and re-exports specific symbols, indicating typical module structure. No suspicious code, data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The minimal code does not involve any input processing, data handling, or external network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module export file with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply facilitates importing and exporting specific components for external use.",
