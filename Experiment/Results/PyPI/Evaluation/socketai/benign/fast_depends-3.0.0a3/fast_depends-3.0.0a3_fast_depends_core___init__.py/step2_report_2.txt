  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module re-export pattern. The code only imports classes/functions from local modules and defines `__all__` for public API exposure. There are no dynamic behaviors, no data processing, and no suspicious code patterns.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They uniformly state that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of anomalies or malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a static import/export declaration with no runtime or dynamic behaviors, there is no justification for higher risk scores. All reports correctly assign 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They base their conclusions on observable code patterns.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard module re-export pattern with no suspicious or malicious elements. The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain component appears safe, with no security issues or malicious intent detected.",
