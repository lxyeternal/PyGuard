{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific components from local modules and defines the public API for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules '.builder' and '.model' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local modules into the current namespace through import statements; no further data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard import and export statements; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports from relative modules and defines '__all__' to specify exported objects. It does not execute any code with side effects, handle external input, or include any suspicious patterns. The simplicity indicates a typical module setup for exposing classes and functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a Python package module, serving to organize and expose components without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
