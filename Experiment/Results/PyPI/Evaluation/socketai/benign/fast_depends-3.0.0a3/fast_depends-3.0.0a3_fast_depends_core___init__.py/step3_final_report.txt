{
  "purpose": "This module serves as a re-export interface, exposing 'CallModel' and 'build_call_model' for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.builder' and '.model'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules and defines '__all__' for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard module pattern. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export pattern with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and their scores are consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
