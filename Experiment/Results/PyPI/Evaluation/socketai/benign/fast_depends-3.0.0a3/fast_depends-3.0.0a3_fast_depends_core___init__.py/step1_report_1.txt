  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could cause data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs static import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
