  "purpose": "Dependency injection framework with dynamic serializer loading, function wrapping, and support for async/sync/generator functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, optional module imports, function parameters, external 'call' methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'call.solve' and 'call.asolve' which could execute external code if 'call' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through dependency models into wrapped functions, potentially into external 'call' methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback import pattern for serializers; reliance on external 'call' objects; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard dependency injection utility with dynamic import fallbacks and function wrappers for async and sync functions. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The fallback import pattern is common and not suspicious. The main external risk stems from the 'call' object passed into the wrappers, which could execute malicious code if compromised, but this is outside the scope of this module. The code does not perform network operations or handle secrets.\n\nThe malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of reliance on external 'call' objects and fallback import patterns, which are typical but could be exploited in an untrusted environment.\n\nOverall, the code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to external dependencies and environment trust, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from common fallback patterns and reliance on external 'call' objects, which are outside the scope of this review. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
