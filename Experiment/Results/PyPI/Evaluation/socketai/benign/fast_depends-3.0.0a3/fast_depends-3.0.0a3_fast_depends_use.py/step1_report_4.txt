{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide dependency injection mechanisms for a Python framework, enabling injection of dependencies and serializers into functions, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and environment indirectly through optional imports; it also reads function inputs, model parameters, and extra dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Function wrappers execute injected functions, possibly passing untrusted parameters; asynchronous and generator functions invoke methods like 'asolve' and 'solve' on models, potentially involving data processing or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function calls into wrapped dependency-injected functions; data is passed to 'real_model.asolve' or 'real_model.solve' depending on sync/async and generator status; serializer classes are dynamically imported and may process data.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. Use of partial, dynamic imports, and wrapping logic are typical for dependency injection frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dependency injection decorators and wrappers, supporting async and sync functions, including generators. It dynamically imports serializer classes, which are then used in model building, but this appears standard for such frameworks. No suspicious network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The 'Provider' class is used but not shown; its usage seems consistent with dependency injection. The code's complexity is consistent with a DI framework and does not include obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a dependency injection utility module typical of frameworks like FastAPI or similar. It dynamically loads serializers, wraps functions for dependency injection, and supports async, sync, and generator functions. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. The overall security risk appears low, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
