  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk stems from common fallback patterns and reliance on external 'call' objects, which are outside the scope of this review. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
