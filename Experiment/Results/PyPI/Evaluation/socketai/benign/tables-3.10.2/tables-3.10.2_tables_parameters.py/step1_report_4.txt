{
  "purpose": "Define configurable parameters for the PyTables library, including cache sizes, limits, and I/O settings.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'os' module; reading environment variables for thread limits; setting constants and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, user input, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are assigned from constants, environment variables, and hardcoded defaults; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. All code consists of straightforward parameter definitions and documentation comments.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains parameter definitions, constants, and documentation comments for PyTables configuration. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. Importing 'os' for environment variable access is standard. No signs of malicious logic, obfuscation, or data leaks. The parameters influence cache and I/O behavior but do not perform any actions themselves.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely configuration metadata for PyTables, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard setup file defining parameters for the library. No malware or security threats identified.",
