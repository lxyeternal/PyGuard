  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of undo/redo with shadow management, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The shadowing mechanism could be exploited if underlying methods are compromised, but within this context, it is a standard feature. Scores are consistent with this assessment."
