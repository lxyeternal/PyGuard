{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to undo and redo various file and node operations, as well as managing shadowed nodes and attributes within a file system abstraction.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as file_ objects, operation types, paths, attribute names, and arguments to specify which actions to undo/redo or shadow/unshadow.",
  "sinks": "Function calls that perform node moves, attribute manipulations, and shadow management, potentially affecting the file system or node attributes.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., operation type, paths, attribute names) is processed in control flow statements that invoke move or attribute functions, which then manipulate nodes and attributes accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses shadow nodes and attribute reassignments to manage undo/redo states, which is standard for such implementations. No suspicious or hidden code, no hardcoded credentials or secret data. No obfuscated code or indirect execution patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured undo/redo functionalities with explicit move operations for nodes and attributes, involving shadow node management. It relies on straightforward method calls and does not execute any external code or network operations. No malicious behavior or malicious intent observed. The operations are consistent with typical undo/redo implementations in file or node systems. The code does not perform any security-sensitive actions like executing system commands or network communication, and it avoids unsafe practices like dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of undo/redo functionality with shadow node management in a file-like system. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not introduce security risks based on its content.",
