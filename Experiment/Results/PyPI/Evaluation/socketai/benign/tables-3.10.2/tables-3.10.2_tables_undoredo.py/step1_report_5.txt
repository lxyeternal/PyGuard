{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to undo and redo filesystem-like operations on a custom File object, including moving nodes and managing shadow attributes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: file objects, paths, attribute names, and operation types.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include method calls that modify the internal state of file nodes and attributes, such as _g_move, _g__setattr, and _g__delattr.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameters through internal method calls to move or modify nodes and attributes, especially in functions like move_to_shadow, move_from_shadow, attr_to_shadow, and attr_from_shadow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected. The code relies on internal methods and standard attribute manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to manage undo/redo operations on a file-like structure, involving moving nodes to shadow states and restoring them, as well as managing attribute shadowing. The functions perform expected filesystem-like manipulations without any evident malicious logic. No network, file system access beyond internal method calls, or external data leaks are observed. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an undo/redo mechanism with shadow attribute management, with no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of undo/redo functionality with shadow attribute handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low, and there are no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
