{
  "purpose": "This code registers custom pylint checker classes into a linter instance, replacing the default VariablesChecker with a custom one.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported modules, the linter object, and the internal _checkers attribute of the linter.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the linter's _checkers list by removing and adding checker instances, which could potentially affect linting behavior.",
  "flows": "The linter object is passed to register(), which then removes the original VariablesChecker and registers custom checkers, modifying internal checkers list.",
  "anomalies": "Direct access to linter._checkers (a protected attribute) and removal of the VariablesChecker suggest internal manipulation, but no malicious code or external data handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to modify the linter's checkers by removing the default VariablesChecker and registering custom checkers. It accesses a protected attribute (_checkers), which indicates internal manipulation, but this is standard in plugin or extension development for pylint. There are no evident data leaks, external network calls, or malicious code snippets such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions are straightforward and only modify the internal list of checkers for linting purposes. The import statements are standard, and the code does not handle external inputs or perform any insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin setup for pylint with no signs of malicious behavior. It internally manipulates the list of checkers to replace default behavior with custom implementations, which is common practice. No malware or malicious intent is detected.",
