{
  "purpose": "This code registers custom checkers for the pylint linter, replacing the default VariablesChecker with a custom implementation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the linter's internal checkers list via linter._checkers and the imported modules for custom checkers.",
  "sinks": "Modifying the linter's internal checker list (linter._checkers) could affect pylint's behavior; no external data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Code reads internal linter checkers -> removes specific checker -> registers custom checkers.",
  "anomalies": "Access to private attribute linter._checkers; no evidence of malicious code, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates pylint's internal checkers by removing the default VariablesChecker and registering custom checkers. This operation involves direct access to a protected attribute, which is generally acceptable for plugin customization but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no external inputs, network connections, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and focused on plugin registration without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for customizing pylint checkers. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to enhance linting with custom rules, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
