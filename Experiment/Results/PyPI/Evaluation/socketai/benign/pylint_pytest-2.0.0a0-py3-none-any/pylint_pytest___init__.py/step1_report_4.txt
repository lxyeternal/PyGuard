{
  "purpose": "This code registers custom checkers with the pylint linter, replacing the default VariablesChecker with a custom implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pylint.checkers.variables, pylint.lint, and relative imports of custom checkers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform IO operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code manages internal registration of checker objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code accesses a protected member (_checkers) of the linter, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to register custom pylint checkers, removing the default VariablesChecker. It manipulates internal attributes of the linter to replace or modify checkers. No external input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. Use of protected attribute _checkers is unconventional but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code safely manages pylint checker registration with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate customization script for static code analysis tooling.",
