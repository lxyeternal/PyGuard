  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for extending pylint with custom checkers. It involves internal state manipulation but no malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The risk score should be around 0.1-0.2 to reflect the unconventional but benign internal access."
