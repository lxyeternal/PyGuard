{
  "purpose": "A static AST visitor for pytest, tracking class attribute assignments related to fixtures, especially 'request.cls'.",
  "sources": "AST nodes during static analysis, particularly function definitions and assignment nodes within pytest test classes.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures used for analysis; no external data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Traversal from source nodes (function definitions, assignments) to internal data structures; no external or malicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; broad exception handling is typical in AST processing but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static AST traversal to identify fixture setup patterns and class attribute assignments in pytest. It manipulates class locals and tracks specific attribute assignments, which is standard for static analysis tools. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The broad exception handling is typical for AST manipulation but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose is benign, focusing on internal analysis without external effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis helper for pytest, with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given its static, internal nature.",
