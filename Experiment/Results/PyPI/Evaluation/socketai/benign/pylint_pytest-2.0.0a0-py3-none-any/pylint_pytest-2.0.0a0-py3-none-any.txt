      "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for extending pylint with custom checkers. It involves internal state manipulation but no malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The risk score should be around 0.1-0.2 to reflect the unconventional but benign internal access."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern primarily due to broad exception handling. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the code's safety and purpose."

It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified by the controlled invocation of pytest during analysis, which is typical for such tools. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
