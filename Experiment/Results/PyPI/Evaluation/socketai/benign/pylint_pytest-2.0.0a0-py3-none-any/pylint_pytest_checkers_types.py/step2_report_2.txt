  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `annotations` from `__future__` for forward compatibility.\n- Imports `Any`, `Dict`, `List` from `typing`.\n- Imports `FixtureDef` from `_pytest.fixtures`.\n- Defines a type alias `FixtureDict` as `Dict[str, List[FixtureDef[Any]]]`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The import of `_pytest.fixtures.FixtureDef` is from an internal pytest module, which could be considered risky if misused, but in this context, it is only used for type annotations.\n- No data flows, external data processing, or network operations are present.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors are evident; the code is straightforward and serves as a type alias for pytest fixtures.\n- The use of internal pytest modules (`_pytest.fixtures`) is generally discouraged for production code but is common in testing utilities and does not imply malicious intent here.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk scores are low (around 0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk score is minimal, reflecting that this is a benign utility snippet.\n- No report suggests any behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume that the code is for type hinting in pytest fixtures.\n- There are no claims or indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.** The code is a simple, safe utility for type annotations in pytest testing code. The use of internal pytest modules does not inherently pose a security risk in this context.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear and straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to internal module import, which is acceptable in testing utilities)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No changes to the scores are necessary. The overall security assessment remains very low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
