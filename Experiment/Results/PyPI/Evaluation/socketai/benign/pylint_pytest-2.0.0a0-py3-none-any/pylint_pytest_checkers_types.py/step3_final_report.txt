{
  "purpose": "Type alias for a dictionary mapping strings to lists of pytest FixtureDef objects, used for type annotations in testing code.",
  "sources": "Import of '_pytest.fixtures.FixtureDef' from an internal pytest module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "The code only defines a type alias; no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Import from an internal pytest module, which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing standard typing modules and an internal pytest class for type annotation. No dynamic code, data processing, or network activity is present. The internal import could be considered risky in production but is common in testing utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a type alias for pytest fixtures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and intended for type hinting in testing contexts. The internal pytest import does not imply malicious intent but warrants cautious use. Overall, the code poses no security threat, and the reports' assessments are accurate.",
