{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a dictionary mapping string keys to lists of pytest FixtureDef objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing module, and pytest fixtures",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines types and imports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for forward reference support, imports typing constructs, and a specific class from pytest fixtures. It then defines a type alias 'FixtureDict' as a dictionary with string keys and list values containing pytest FixtureDef objects. There are no data inputs, external outputs, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve a type annotation purpose for testing or project structuring. No malicious or security-risk patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type alias definition for a pytest-related data structure with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
