  "purpose": "Define type alias for a dictionary mapping string keys to lists of pytest FixtureDef objects.",
  "sources": "Import statements, including future annotations, typing module, and pytest fixtures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present; no data is being sent or stored in insecure ways.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias definition with standard imports. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for forward compatibility, imports typing for type annotations, and imports FixtureDef from _pytest.fixtures. It then defines FixtureDict as a type alias for a dictionary with string keys and list of FixtureDef objects as values. There are no functions, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and standard for type hinting in pytest-related code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign type alias definition used for typing annotations in pytest fixtures. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
