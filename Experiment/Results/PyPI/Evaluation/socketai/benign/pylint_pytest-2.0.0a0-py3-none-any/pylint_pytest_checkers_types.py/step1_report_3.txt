{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up type annotations and import a specific fixture class from the pytest testing framework, likely for use in testing or fixtures management.",
  "sources": "Import statements (_pytest.fixtures import FixtureDef), type alias definition (FixtureDict)",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks identified",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports necessary modules, defines a type alias for a dictionary mapping strings to lists of FixtureDef objects. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data manipulations. The import of _pytest.fixtures suggests this code is part of a testing setup. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for setting up type annotations in a test-related context. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
