{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type aliases for handling pytest fixture definitions, likely used in testing setups.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data is transferred to sinks such as network, file system, or other sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a potentially internal pytest class '_pytest.fixtures.FixtureDef' which could be considered unusual or risky depending on context, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, uses standard typing imports, and defines a type alias 'FixtureDict' as a dictionary mapping strings to lists of pytest fixture definitions. It references a private module '_pytest.fixtures', which is generally intended for internal use and could be considered risky if used improperly, but in itself does not constitute malicious behavior. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any actions beyond type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility snippet primarily used for type hinting in pytest-based testing code. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
