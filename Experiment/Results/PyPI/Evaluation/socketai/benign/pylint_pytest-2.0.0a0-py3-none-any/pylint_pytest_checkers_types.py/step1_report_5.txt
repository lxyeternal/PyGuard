{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for fixture dictionaries used in pytest-based testing frameworks.",
  "sources": "Imports the '__future__' module, the 'typing' module, and '_pytest.fixtures'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code primarily defines types.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only sets up type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'from __future__ import annotations' to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, which is a common practice for forward references and type hints. It imports standard typing constructs and a specific fixture class from pytest. It then defines a type alias 'FixtureDict' for a dictionary mapping strings to lists of 'FixtureDef' objects. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or other suspicious operations. Overall, this is a straightforward type alias definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for type annotations in pytest test configurations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
