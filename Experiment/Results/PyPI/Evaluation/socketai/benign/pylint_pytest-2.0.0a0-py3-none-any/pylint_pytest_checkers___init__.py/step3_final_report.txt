  "purpose": "Define a pylint plugin class with backward compatibility logic based on pylint version.",
  "sources": "PYLINT_VERSION_MAJOR variable, import from pylint.interfaces, class definition",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interactions",
  "flows": "Conditional import based on version, assignment of __implements__ within class",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import inside class scope, which is unusual but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code implements a compatibility layer for pylint plugins, conditionally importing an interface based on the pylint version. It avoids any data handling, network, or file operations. The pattern is standard for backward compatibility. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or secrets. The conditional import within class scope is unconventional but benign. Overall, the code poses no security threat and functions solely as a compatibility utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-dependent compatibility class for a pylint plugin. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
