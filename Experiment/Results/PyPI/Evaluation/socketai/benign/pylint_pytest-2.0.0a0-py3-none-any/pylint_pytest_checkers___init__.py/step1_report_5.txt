  "purpose": "Define a custom pylint checker class for pytest, with compatibility for different pylint versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from pylint.checkers and pylint_pytest.utils, conditional import inside the class based on PYLINT_VERSION_MAJOR.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external system calls, or sensitive data operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import within class scope based on version check is unusual but not inherently malicious; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that conditionally imports an interface based on pylint version, for compatibility purposes. It uses a version check and dynamic import, which is slightly unusual but benign. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data leaks, or harmful behaviors. The code appears to be a standard compatibility shim for a pylint plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility for a pylint plugin, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
