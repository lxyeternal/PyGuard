  "purpose": "Define a custom pylint checker for pytest-related checks with backward compatibility considerations for different pylint versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pylint.checkers and pylint_pytest.utils; class definition and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution, network, or file write operations present.",
  "flows": "Imports and class attributes do not process external input or data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on PYLINT_VERSION_MAJOR; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports an interface from pylint for backward compatibility, based on the pylint version. It defines a class with a name attribute. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The structure is straightforward and adheres to typical plugin patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign plugin definition for pylint, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves compatibility purposes and does not process or transmit sensitive data.",
