  "purpose": "Define a custom Pylint checker for pytest compatibility, with version-based conditional import.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pylint and pylint_pytest.utils, usage of PYLINT_VERSION_MAJOR variable.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no code execution, data leaks, or external connections present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import logic is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on version; no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Pylint version and conditionally imports an interface for backward compatibility. The import is straightforward and controlled, and no external or untrusted data is processed or executed. The comments clarify intentions and are typical for version handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-dependent Pylint plugin component. It contains no malware, malicious logic, or security risks.",
