  "purpose": "Define a custom Pylint checker class for pytest-related linting, with backward compatibility considerations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pylint.checkers and pylint_pytest.utils, class definition, conditional import inside class.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class, conditional import based on PYLINT_VERSION_MAJOR, setting __implements__ if condition met.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import within class scope is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a custom Pylint checker class with a compatibility layer for older Pylint versions. The conditional import based on a version check is standard practice for compatibility. No malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate purpose of defining a custom plugin class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a compatibility pattern for a Pylint plugin. No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior detected.",
