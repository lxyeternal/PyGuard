  "purpose": "Define a custom pylint checker class for pytest compatibility and retro support.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pylint.checkers, local utils, and conditional import within class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports and class definition flow; no data flow from source to sink with security implications.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import based on PYLINT_VERSION_MAJOR; no suspicious code, no obfuscated patterns, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of BaseChecker, conditionally imports IAstroidChecker for compatibility with pylint versions less than 3, and assigns a class attribute. No user input handling, network access, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or malicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, version-dependent compatibility layer for pylint plugin development. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
