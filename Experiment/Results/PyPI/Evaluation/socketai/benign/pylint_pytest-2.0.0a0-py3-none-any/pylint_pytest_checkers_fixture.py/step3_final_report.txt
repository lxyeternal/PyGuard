{
  "purpose": "A static analysis plugin for pytest that inspects test modules for fixture usage, deprecations, and misconfigurations by invoking pytest's collection mechanisms during analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads test file paths, decorators, function arguments, and pytest collection reports; invokes pytest.main() to gather fixture definitions.",
  "sinks": "Captures stdout and stderr during pytest invocation; stores fixture data and errors for reporting.",
  "flows": "Runs pytest.main() with specific flags, captures output streams, analyzes decorators and function args, then reports findings.",
  "anomalies": "Uses pytest.main() during static analysis, which could execute test code; suppresses output to avoid clutter; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility that leverages pytest's internal fixture collection by invoking pytest.main() during module analysis, capturing output streams to prevent clutter. It inspects decorators for deprecated or improper usage, records fixture definitions and errors, and reports issues accordingly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The invocation of pytest.main() during static analysis is a standard pattern for fixture collection, though it could pose a risk if test files are malicious. The code is straightforward, with clear structure and purpose, and employs standard practices for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis plugin for pytest, designed to improve code quality and enforce best practices. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified by the controlled invocation of pytest during analysis, which is typical for such tools. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
