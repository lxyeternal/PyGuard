{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to analyze Python code structures, particularly focusing on identifying pytest fixtures and decorators, and handling AST nodes for code analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads static code elements such as decorators, function names, AST nodes, and module globals.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is used to influence security-critical operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The functions analyze decorators and function definitions to determine pytest fixture usage, without any data flow to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs deep AST analysis with multiple attribute checks; however, it does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. It is focused on code inspection logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility module that inspects AST nodes to identify pytest-related decorators and fixtures. It employs multiple attribute and type checks to accurately determine whether certain decorators are pytest fixtures, marks, or autouse fixtures. It also verifies whether fixtures belong to the same module via inspect and import operations. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration activities are present. The logic appears straightforward and related to code analysis rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis helper for pytest fixture identification. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, nor does it perform any harmful operations. Its purpose is to facilitate code inspection, with no evident security risks.",
