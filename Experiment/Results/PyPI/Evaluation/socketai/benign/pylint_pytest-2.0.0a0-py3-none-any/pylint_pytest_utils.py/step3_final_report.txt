{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to analyze Python AST nodes for pytest fixtures, marks, and decorators, primarily for static code analysis or linting purposes.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing decorators, function definitions, and import statements; module globals via 'decorator.root().globals'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code inspects static AST structures without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "AST nodes are inspected for specific attribute patterns; no data flows from external sources to sinks; pattern matching is static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling ('except AttributeError' and 'except Exception') which could hide errors but not malicious intent; no obfuscation or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static AST pattern matching to identify pytest fixtures and decorators, employing robust but broad exception handling. It does not perform any network, file, or dynamic code operations. The logic is straightforward, focusing on AST node attributes and structure. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behaviors are present. The broad exception handling could mask errors but does not introduce security risks. The code's purpose is benign, serving static analysis functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for pytest constructs, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern primarily due to broad exception handling. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the code's safety and purpose.",
