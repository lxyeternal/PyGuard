{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing Python code, particularly focusing on detecting pytest fixtures and decorators within AST nodes for static code analysis.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from function decorators, AST nodes, and global symbol tables (e.g., decorator attributes, decorator nodes, import nodes, globals in AST).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or malicious actions are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST nodes (decorators, function definitions) through helper functions that analyze attributes and names, but there is no execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains numerous deep attribute accesses with try-except blocks, but no unusual or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The use of inspect.getmodule() is standard but could be misused if provided malicious modules, which is unlikely in static analysis context.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily static analysis for pytest fixtures and decorators, using astroid library for AST parsing. Functions check for specific decorator patterns and module origin. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or harmful side effects are present. The code appears to be a utility for static code checking rather than executing untrusted code. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis utility focused on identifying pytest fixtures and decorators, with no signs of malware or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious logic.",
