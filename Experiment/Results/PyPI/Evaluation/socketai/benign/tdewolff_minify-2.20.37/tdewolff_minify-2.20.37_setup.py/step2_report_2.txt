  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a legitimate setup script with a custom build extension that compiles Go code if source files are missing. The subprocess call uses fixed arguments, no untrusted data, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (justified, as no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are apparent)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the subprocess call to 'go build' and inclusion of a precompiled 'minify.so'. Slight concern about the use of subprocess without validation, but overall, it appears standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to external build invocation, but still low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** The script is a typical setup with a controlled invocation of 'go build'. No malicious code or secrets are present. The subprocess call is controlled and necessary for building external code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (still low, given the external process call)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, the code is a standard setup with a custom build step invoking 'go build'. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the setup script performs legitimate build steps, invoking 'go build' with fixed arguments. No signs of malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package that integrates Go code via external build commands.\n- **Malware & Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads across all reports.\n- **External Commands & Data Flow:** The subprocess calls are fixed and controlled, with no untrusted input influencing command execution.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Risk Scores:** The scores are generally low, justified by the controlled external build process. Slight increases (0.1-0.2) reflect minimal potential risk but are not indicative of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The current scores seem reasonable given the information.\n- The only point to consider is that invoking external build commands always carries a minimal risk if inputs are manipulated, but in this context, the inputs are fixed and verified.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (due to external process invocation, but controlled)\n\n**Overall, the package setup code appears legitimate, safe, and aligned with standard practices for integrating external language builds.**",
