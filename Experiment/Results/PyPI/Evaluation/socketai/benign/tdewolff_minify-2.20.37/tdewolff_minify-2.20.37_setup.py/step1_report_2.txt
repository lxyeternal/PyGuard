  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package that includes a custom build step for a Go extension and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, checking existence of extension source files, executing subprocess to build Go code",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to 'go build', reading package files",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Checking files -> Possibly executing 'go build' -> Setting up package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess check_call to execute 'go build' without sanitization or validation; extension source 'minify.so' is presumed to be precompiled but is included directly; potential mislabeling of programming languages in classifiers (JavaScript listed among Python), but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks, including defining a custom build class that attempts to compile Go code into a shared object if source files are missing. The subprocess call to 'go build' could be used maliciously if the build command is manipulated, but here it appears standard. The inclusion of a precompiled shared object 'minify.so' indicates reliance on external binary code. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious network activity are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup with custom build steps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom build extension that compiles Go code if necessary. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. The subprocess call is used for external build automation, which is common in such contexts. The package appears legitimate and safe based on the provided code.",
