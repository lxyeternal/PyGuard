  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'tdewolff-minify' with external Go build integration.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, checks existence of source files, invokes 'go build' via subprocess, references 'minify.so'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to 'go build' with fixed arguments; no untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Source: source file existence check; Sink: subprocess call to 'go build'; Flow: source files -> subprocess invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; subprocess uses fixed, controlled arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script that conditionally invokes 'go build' to compile Go code into a shared library. The subprocess call is fixed and does not process untrusted input, minimizing risk. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The package metadata and dependencies are typical. External build invocation is controlled and necessary for integrating Go code. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and align with common practices for multi-language package setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script with controlled external build steps. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified by the external process invocation, which is standard and controlled.",
