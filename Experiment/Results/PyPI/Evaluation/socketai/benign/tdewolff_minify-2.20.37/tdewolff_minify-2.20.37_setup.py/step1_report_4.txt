  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that integrates Go-based minifiers and builds extensions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, reads extension source files, and potentially executes 'go build' command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'go build' command in build_extension method; potentially used to compile external code.",
  "flows": "If extension sources do not exist, the code runs 'go build' to generate shared libraries, which are then used as extension modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'go' command in build process, which is not standard for Python packages; the code attempts to build shared objects dynamically during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup configuration for a Python package, incorporating custom build steps. It reads the README.md for documentation, defines a custom build extension class that attempts to compile Go code into shared libraries if needed, and then sets up the package including the extension module 'minify'. The build_ext_external class dynamically invokes 'go build' to produce shared objects, which are then loaded as Python extension modules. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or privacy violations are evident. The use of 'go build' indicates reliance on an external Go environment, but this is part of the build process, not runtime. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities. The script appears to follow standard setup procedures with a custom build step for external Go code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom build step for compiling Go code during package installation. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware; it mainly facilitates building external shared libraries via Go. No suspicious anomalies or malicious activities are detected.",
