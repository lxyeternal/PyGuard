  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, transparent wrapper around a native minification library. The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity of the external shared library during deployment. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to external library trust assumptions."
