  "purpose": "A wrapper around a native shared library ('minify.so') for code minification, providing configuration, string, and file minification functions.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary keys and values, input strings, filenames",
  "sinks": "Native library functions that process data; potential for untrusted data to cause issues if inputs are malicious",
  "flows": "Configuration data and code strings from Python to native functions; filenames to native functions; errors propagated via exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; dynamic loading of shared library without verification",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python wrapper around a native minification library, passing data directly to native functions with error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the external shared library ('minify.so'), which is loaded dynamically without verification, representing a supply chain trust issue rather than malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior and assign a malware score of 0. The risk score of approximately 0.2-0.3 reflects the concern about external library integrity, which is reasonable. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns support a low malware and obfuscation score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, transparent wrapper around a native minification library. The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity of the external shared library during deployment. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to external library trust assumptions.",
