  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It acts as a wrapper around a native shared library (`minify.so`) for code minification.\n- Provides configuration, string minification, and file minification functions.\n- Loads the shared library dynamically without explicit verification.\n- Passes data directly to native functions, with error handling via exceptions.\n- No evident malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior within the Python wrapper itself.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Assessment:**\n- Finds no malicious activity.\n- High confidence (0.9).\n- Malware score: 0, reasonable.\n- No obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores seem appropriate.** The report correctly identifies the code as a safe wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Assessment:**\n- Notes dynamic loading of `minify.so` without verification.\n- No malicious code detected.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.8).\n- Malware score: 0, justified.\n- Concerns about the integrity of the shared library are valid but not directly malicious.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.** The concern about loading external libraries without verification is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizes the reliance on external shared library.\n- No validation or sanitization of inputs before passing to native code.\n- Maintains low risk, malware score: 0.\n- Confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** The report correctly highlights the trust dependency on the external library.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Assessment:**\n- Reiterates that the code is a straightforward wrapper.\n- No suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n- Focuses on the integrity of `minify.so`.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are justified.** No malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar conclusions: safe wrapper, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Notes the lack of validation of the external library.\n- Malware score: 0.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are consistent and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a wrapper around a native library.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of the external shared library (`minify.so`), which is loaded dynamically without verification.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, due to reliance on external shared library without verification. A score of around 0.2-0.3 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is transparent)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (trust in external library integrity is a concern but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe wrapper around a native minification library. The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity of the shared library (`minify.so`) during deployment, which is outside the scope of this code but critical in practice.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nTo improve security, consider adding checksum verification or signature validation for the shared library before loading it dynamically.",
