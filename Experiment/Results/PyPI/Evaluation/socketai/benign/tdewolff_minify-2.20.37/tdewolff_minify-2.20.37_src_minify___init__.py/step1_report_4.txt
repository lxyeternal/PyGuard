{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to a native minification library, enabling configuration, string minification, and file minification based on MIME types.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from a Python dictionary, input strings from function arguments, and filenames from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Calls to native library functions 'minifyConfig', 'minifyString', and 'minifyFile' which handle the actual minification process and may process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the Python dictionary into the native library via key-value pairs; input strings flow from the 'string' function into the native library; filenames are passed directly to the native library functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly loads a shared object 'minify.so' from the local filesystem without verification; it constructs byte arrays for data passing but does not perform input validation or sanitization beyond the native library’s internal checks; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; the code relies on the native library for core processing.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around a native minification library, passing data directly between Python and C code. It does not execute any untrusted code, nor does it contain evident backdoors or malicious logic. The dynamic loading of 'minify.so' is a potential concern if the library is tampered with, but within this code, no malicious behavior is apparent. The functions are designed to process input data and pass it to the native library for minification. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The library's security depends on the integrity of 'minify.so'. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python wrapper for a native minification library, with no immediate signs of malicious intent. Its security depends on the trustworthiness of the native shared object. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or backdoors, nor unsafe handling of data within the Python code itself.",
