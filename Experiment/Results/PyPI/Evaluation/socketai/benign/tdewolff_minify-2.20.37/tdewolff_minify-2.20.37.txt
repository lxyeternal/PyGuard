The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured setup script with controlled external build steps. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified by the external process invocation, which is standard and controlled."

      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, transparent wrapper around a native minification library. The primary security concern is ensuring the integrity of the external shared library during deployment. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to external library trust assumptions."
