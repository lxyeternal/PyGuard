{
  "purpose": "Defines C function signatures for minification operations and compiles a Python extension module using cffi.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code only sets up function signatures and triggers compilation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no data processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data handling occurs within this script; it only compiles the extension.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports cffi, defines C function prototypes for minification functions, and compiles a Python extension module. There are no input or output operations, no untrusted data handling, nor code execution beyond setup. The code's purpose is to facilitate integration with C functions, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The setup process is standard for creating cffi bindings, and there are no signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for cffi bindings with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It merely defines function signatures and compiles an extension module. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
