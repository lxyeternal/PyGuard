{
  "purpose": "The code defines C function signatures and compiles a CFFI wrapper for a minification library, likely to optimize media or configuration data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly, but implicitly relies on external C implementations and potentially external data passed to the compiled functions at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The compiled functions could process untrusted data when invoked, especially 'minifyString' and 'minifyFile', which handle input data and output buffers, but this occurs outside of this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this code itself, as it only defines C function signatures and compiles the extension. Actual data flow depends on subsequent usage of the compiled module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are visible in the code. It appears to be a straightforward setup for a CFFI extension, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cffi, defines C function signatures for minification routines, sets up a CFFI source, and compiles it if run as the main script. There are no input/output operations, no network calls, and no dynamic execution beyond the compilation process. It relies on external C code for functionality, but this is common for performance-critical modules. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Since the script only prepares bindings for external C functions, potential risks depend on the external C code's implementation, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup for a CFFI-based extension module that interfaces with external C code for minification tasks. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks within this code fragment itself.",
