{
  "purpose": "Define and compile a CFFI interface for minification functions related to configuration, string, and file processing.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code defines C function signatures but does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or perform output actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only sets up CFFI definitions and compiles a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports cffi, defines C function signatures for minification routines, initializes a CFFI object, sets source to None (indicating no C source code included), defines the C functions via cdef, and compiles the module if run as main. It lacks any data processing, external input reading, or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code solely prepares a binding for external C functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python CFFI interface to external minification functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and serves a functional purpose related to defining C function bindings.",
