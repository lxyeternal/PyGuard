  "purpose": "Set up cffi bindings for C minification functions, enabling Python to call external C code.",
  "sources": "Defines C function signatures; no data input or output handling within this script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; external C functions may process data at runtime, outside this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow within this script; potential source-to-sink flows depend on external C code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward setup with no obfuscation or embedded malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines C function signatures and compiles a Python extension module. It does not process data, handle input/output, or perform any runtime logic. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. External C code invoked at runtime could process untrusted data, but this is outside the scope of this script. The code is standard for setting up cffi bindings, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, straightforward, and intended for legitimate use. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for its purpose.",
