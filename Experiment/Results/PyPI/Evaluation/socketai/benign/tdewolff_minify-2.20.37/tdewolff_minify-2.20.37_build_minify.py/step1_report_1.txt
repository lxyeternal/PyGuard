{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) using cffi to interact with C functions related to minification processes, likely for media or data compression.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data directly; it only defines C function signatures and compiles a module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle or pass untrusted data; it only prepares a C extension module.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks within this code; it solely prepares the interface and compiles it.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs. It only defines and compiles a CFFI extension with no embedded or dynamic code execution, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script defines C function signatures for minification operations and compiles a CFFI extension module named 'minify._ffi_minify'. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no external communications. The code is minimal and standard for setting up CFFI bindings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The functions declared are typical for media or data processing and do not suggest malicious intent. The compile step is standard for CFFI modules.\n\nOverall, the code performs a benign setup task without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for CFFI bindings to C functions related to minification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate data processing purposes.",
