{
  "purpose": "This code defines C function signatures for a minification library and compiles a CFFI extension module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it only defines C function signatures and compiles a module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; it solely sets up and compiles a CFFI extension.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. It appears to be a straightforward CFFI setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports cffi, defines C function signatures related to minification operations, sets up a CFFI interface, and compiles it if run as main. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling that could indicate malicious behavior. The code's simplicity and standard structure suggest it's a legitimate binding setup for a native library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a CFFI interface with no malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious, with no evidence of backdoors, malware, or malicious data handling.",
