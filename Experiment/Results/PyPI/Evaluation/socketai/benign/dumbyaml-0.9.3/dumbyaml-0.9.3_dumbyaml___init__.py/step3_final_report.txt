  "sources": "yaml.scan() for token inspection, yaml.load() with DumbLoader for parsing input data.",

  "flows": "Source: yaml.scan() tokens and input document; Sink: yaml.load() execution with DumbLoader; Flow: tokens checked before loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() instead of safe_load(), reliance on external DumbLoader without verification, token filtering as a security measure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs token filtering to restrict certain YAML constructs and then loads the document using yaml.load() with a custom loader DumbLoader. The main security concern is the use of yaml.load() with an unverified loader, which could execute arbitrary code if DumbLoader is malicious or insecure. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets is present. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0. The security risk score varies depending on trust in DumbLoader; given the potential for code execution, a conservative estimate is around 0.6 if the loader is untrusted. The code's safety hinges on the implementation of DumbLoader, which is not provided, making the risk conditional.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the reliance on an unverified custom loader with yaml.load(), which can execute arbitrary code if malicious. No malicious activity is evident, but the risk is significant if DumbLoader is untrusted. The code is clear and not obfuscated. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the overall security risk should be considered moderate to high (~0.6) due to the potential for malicious loader execution.",
