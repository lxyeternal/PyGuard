Overall, the code poses no security threat and can be considered safe."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The primary concern is the reliance on an unverified custom loader with yaml.load(), which can execute arbitrary code if malicious. No malicious activity is evident, but the risk is significant if DumbLoader is untrusted. The code is clear and not obfuscated. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the overall security risk should be considered moderate to high (~0.6) due to the potential for malicious loader execution."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite validating YAML parsing restrictions. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk due to the enforcement of restrictions, but overall, the code is safe and intended for validation purposes."
