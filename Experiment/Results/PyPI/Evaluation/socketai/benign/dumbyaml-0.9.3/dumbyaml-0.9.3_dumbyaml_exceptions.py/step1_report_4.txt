  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for YAML parsing errors and disallowed tokens in YAML processing.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__ methods) and class inheritance structures.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages formatted with object representations and type info, which could potentially leak internal data if misused.",
  "flows": "Exception message creation from object __repr__() and type info, but these are standard and do not involve untrusted input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden logic, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception class from a YAML error module, then defines several custom exception classes for specific YAML error cases. The classes mostly initialize with parameters and generate formatted error messages. The message formatting uses object representations and type info but does not incorporate untrusted input directly. The class hierarchy and exception message generation are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code does not perform any external network operations, data collection, or manipulation beyond exception message formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of custom exception class definitions for YAML error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a normal, non-malicious part of a YAML processing library.",
