  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for YAML parsing errors to handle specific error cases with detailed messages.",
  "sources": "Importing YAMLError from yaml.error module, and class initializations that generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "Super constructors (__init__ methods) of YAMLError that generate error strings; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with parameters; no untrusted data flow leading to external effects.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. Classes are standard exception definitions with no unusual or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from yaml.error.YAMLError. These classes generate formatted error messages based on input parameters. The implementation is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. The use of super() is consistent, and no data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve as part of a YAML parsing library to handle specific error scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in YAML processing. No malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or security risks are evident.",
