  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific YAML parsing and validation errors.",
  "sources": "None; no input data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or sensitive data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The class hierarchy and exception handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from YAMLError. These classes include descriptive messages for type comparison errors, type conversion errors, and disallowed tokens during YAML processing. The constructors properly call superclass constructors with formatted error messages. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. The use of class inheritance and error messages is standard for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely for defining exception classes related to YAML errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a YAML parsing library.",
