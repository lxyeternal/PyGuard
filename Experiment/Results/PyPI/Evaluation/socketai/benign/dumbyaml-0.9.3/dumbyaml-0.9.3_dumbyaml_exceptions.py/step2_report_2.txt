  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines custom exception classes for YAML errors. No malicious activity, no data flow, standard class inheritance, proper constructor calls.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on exception classes for YAML parsing errors. No data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Standard exception class definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, defining exception classes for YAML errors, no malicious code, no data leaks.\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward class definitions, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with message formatting, potential concern about exposing internal data via __repr__().\n- **Assessment:** Using __repr__() in error messages can sometimes leak internal object details if those objects contain sensitive info or are untrusted. However, in a controlled YAML library context, this is common practice for debugging/error reporting.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher due to message formatting with object representations, but generally standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, given the potential for internal data exposure.\n\n**Verdict:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is justified, considering that __repr__() might reveal internal details if misused, but overall, it's a benign pattern in exception reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with message formatting, noting that __repr__() could reveal internal object details if untrusted objects are used.\n- **Assessment:** This is a valid point; using __repr__() in error messages can sometimes expose internal state. However, the code itself is standard, and unless the objects passed are untrusted or contain sensitive info, this is a typical pattern.\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** No.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher, but still within normal bounds.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code pattern. The score reflects a minor potential concern, not a real security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct; no malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0, with a slight increase (0.1) in reports 4 and 5 due to the use of __repr__() in error messages, which could potentially leak internal info if misused.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n\n- The code is standard exception class definitions for a YAML library.\n- No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- The minor security risk score of 0.1 in reports 4 and 5 is justified, considering the potential for internal data exposure via __repr__().\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1          |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with only a minor note on the use of __repr__() in error messages.**",
