  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and logical flaws.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exception classes for YAML errors. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, straightforward class definitions for error handling. No security risks or malware.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard exception class definitions. No suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code is safe and standard.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard custom exception classes with no malicious intent.  \n- **Assessment:** No concerns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Exception message formatting uses object __repr__() and type info, which could potentially leak internal data if misused, but this is standard in error reporting. No malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The use of __repr__() in error messages is typical, but if untrusted objects are passed, it could expose internal details. However, this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, given the potential for internal data leakage if misused. No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with detailed error messages, using __repr__(). Slightly higher confidence in potential information leakage.  \n- **Assessment:** The use of __repr__() could reveal internal object details if untrusted objects are passed, but this is standard in error messages. No malicious activity or malware detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern primarily related to potential information leakage via __repr__().\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor risk due to potential internal data exposure if __repr__() is called with untrusted objects, but this is typical in error handling and not a security flaw.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with only a minor concern about internal data exposure in error messages, which is a common and acceptable practice in exception handling.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No adjustments necessary.",
