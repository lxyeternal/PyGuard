  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for YAML errors, used for error handling within a YAML processing library.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class constructors generate error messages based on passed objects.",
  "sinks": "Error messages that include object representations (__repr__()) and type info, which could potentially leak internal object details if untrusted objects are passed.",
  "flows": "From exception class instantiation with objects to error message formatting using __repr__() and type information.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __repr__() in error messages could expose internal object details; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions inheriting from YAMLError, primarily for error reporting. The use of __repr__() in messages is standard but could leak internal data if untrusted objects are passed. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential information leakage, which is typical in error handling. No data flows from untrusted sources or network activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for exception handling in a YAML library. The minor security concern about __repr__() exposing internal details is acceptable and common practice. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
