{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for handling specific YAML parsing and dumping errors in a YAML processing library.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__ methods) that take input parameters such as items, item types, tokens, and token objects.",
  "sinks": "Super calls to the parent class constructor with formatted error messages; potential display or logging of these messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (items, tokens) are formatted into error messages and passed to the superclass, but no external data flow or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __repr__() in error message formatting could reveal internal object details if triggered with untrusted objects, but this is standard practice in error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes related to YAML errors, including type mismatches, invalid conversions, and disallowed tokens. The constructors format informative error messages. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code primarily facilitates error reporting within a YAML parser or dumper. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The use of __repr__() for error message formatting is typical and not inherently dangerous. Overall, this code is standard error class definitions for a YAML library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception classes intended for handling specific YAML errors. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The code is benign and typical for a parsing library. No security risks are apparent.",
