  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific YAML errors, such as type mismatch, invalid conversions, and disallowed tokens.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines classes and error messages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely establishes exception classes without runtime logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from YAMLError, used for handling specific YAML parsing or dumping errors. It includes detailed error messages for type mismatches and invalid conversions. The classes for disallowed tokens set attributes but do not perform any dangerous operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for YAML error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard error class implementation without any suspicious behavior.",
