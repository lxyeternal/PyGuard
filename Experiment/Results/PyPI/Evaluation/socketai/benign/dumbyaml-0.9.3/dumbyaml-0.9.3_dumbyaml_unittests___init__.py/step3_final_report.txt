{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a simple HTTP server using standard Python modules, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Standard Python modules such as http.server or socket, reading configuration or network data if any.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets used for server operation; no untrusted data flow leading to data leaks or malicious actions identified.",
  "flows": "Input from network requests handled by the server, with no evidence of malicious data manipulation or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed; code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of a Python HTTP server, using standard libraries without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code does not perform unsafe operations like SQL injection, code injection, or data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is effectively zero. Confidence in benign nature is high, given the simplicity and standard modules used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating no malware, no obfuscation, and very low security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
