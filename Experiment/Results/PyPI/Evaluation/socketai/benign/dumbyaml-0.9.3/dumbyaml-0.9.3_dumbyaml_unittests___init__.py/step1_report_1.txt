{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and run a simple HTTP server or handler, possibly for serving static files or API responses.",
  "sources": "Input may be received from network requests or environment variables (if any). There are no explicit input sources shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, system calls, or logging outputs. Specific sinks are not clearly evident from the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network inputs or environment variables (if used) to response handling or logging mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns. No unusual or suspicious functions or behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard Python modules to create and run a server-like process. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system modification, or suspicious network connections. The structure is straightforward, focusing on serving requests. Without additional context or hidden code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code is a typical server setup using Python's standard libraries, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
