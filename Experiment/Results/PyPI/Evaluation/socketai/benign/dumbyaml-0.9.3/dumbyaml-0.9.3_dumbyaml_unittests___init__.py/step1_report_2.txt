  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input functions, and imported modules that may read files or network data.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, depending on later code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from input sources or environment variables to sensitive sinks such as network or filesystem operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs. The code structure is straightforward, but further detail is needed for deeper analysis.",
  "analysis": "Initial review indicates standard import statements and function definitions. No malicious system calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are immediately evident. Lacking specific code content prevents identifying malicious patterns definitively. No malicious intent detected from the provided code snippet, but the absence of detailed logic limits full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The code appears benign but insufficient information prevents a definitive judgment. No malware or malicious anomalies are detected.",
