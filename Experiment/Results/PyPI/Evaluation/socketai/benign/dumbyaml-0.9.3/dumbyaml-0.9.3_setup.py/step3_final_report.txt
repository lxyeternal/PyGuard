  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'dumbyaml' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata definitions, dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static data read from files (README), used for package description; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'codecs.open' without explicit encoding, but this is a common pattern and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for Python packaging, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. All signals indicate benign behavior. The minor concern about file encoding is standard and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain threats. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
