  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'dumbyaml' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads long description from 'README.rst', retrieves package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external commands executed.",
  "flows": "N/A – no flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials, no unusual code behaviors, no obfuscated code, no backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It reads a description file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion rules. It imports only standard library modules and third-party dependencies without executing or processing untrusted input. No suspicious or malicious logic, no network activity, and no code that would indicate sabotage or malware intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
