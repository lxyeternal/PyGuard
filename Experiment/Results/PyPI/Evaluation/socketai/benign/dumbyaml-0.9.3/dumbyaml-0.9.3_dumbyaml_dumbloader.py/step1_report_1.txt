{
  "purpose": "Define a custom YAML loader class that combines multiple YAML parsing components without implicit typing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input stream in the __init__ method via the stream parameter.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process or output data beyond initialization.",
  "flows": "Input stream -> Loader class initialization -> YAML parsing components setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The code simply combines existing YAML loader classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class DumbLoader that inherits from several YAML parser components. Its constructor initializes all parent classes with the provided stream and default parameters. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The implementation is straightforward, intended to create a YAML loader that does not perform implicit typing. No external data flows or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom YAML loader that explicitly avoids implicit typing. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
