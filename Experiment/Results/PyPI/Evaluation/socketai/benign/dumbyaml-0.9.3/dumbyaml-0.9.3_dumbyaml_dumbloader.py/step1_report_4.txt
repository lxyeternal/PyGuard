{
  "purpose": "Define a custom YAML loader class that explicitly avoids implicit typing by combining multiple YAML parsing components.",
  "sources": "Input stream provided to the constructor (__init__).",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input stream → YAML parser components (Reader, Scanner, Parser, Composer, Constructor, Resolver) → Data processing (not shown).",
  "anomalies": "The class combines multiple YAML parsing components but does not perform any unusual operations, obfuscation, or include hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'DumbLoader' that inherits from several YAML parser classes to create a loader that disables implicit typing. The constructor initializes all parent classes with the input stream. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are present. The code is a standard class composition pattern for a custom YAML loader.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a custom YAML loader designed to prevent implicit typing. It contains no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
