  "purpose": "This script conditionally builds Rust extensions for a Python package based on filesystem checks, importing 'setuptools_rust' if needed.",
  "sources": "Filesystem checks for directories 'src/opendp/lib' and 'src/opendp/rust'; import statement for 'setuptools_rust'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks capable of data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks determine whether to import 'setuptools_rust' and configure Rust extensions; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward build setup logic with conditional dependency import.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem checks to decide whether to build Rust extensions, attempting to import 'setuptools_rust' if directories exist. It raises an informative error if dependencies are missing. No malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logic is typical for such build scripts, with no obfuscation or external network activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices support these conclusions. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with optional Rust extension support. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
