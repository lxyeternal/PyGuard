{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup process for a Python package, optionally building Rust extensions if certain directories are present.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check directory existence; imports modules (setuptools, os, setuptools_rust); attempts to import and use setuptools_rust to configure Rust extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted user input or data; no network or system calls that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Filesystem checks trigger conditional setup; imports and module usage lead to conditional installation steps, but no untrusted data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unnecessary dynamic execution. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory existence checks and conditionally configures Rust extension building via setuptools_rust. It gracefully handles missing dependencies by raising an ImportError. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or data leakage. The code only interacts with the filesystem and standard package setup modules, with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It conditionally builds Rust extensions and manages dependencies properly. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
