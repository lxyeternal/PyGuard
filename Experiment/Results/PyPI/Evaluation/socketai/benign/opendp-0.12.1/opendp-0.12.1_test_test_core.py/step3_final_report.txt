{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the opendp library, verifying functionality, boundary conditions, and correctness of domains, measures, transformations, and privacy profiles.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, test data, internal library functions, and boundary inputs within test functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and internal function calls; no external data leaks, network activity, or file access.",
  "flows": "Data flows through test functions and library functions; no external or malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The test for infinite iteration over a ctypes pointer class is a safety check, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, standard test suite for the opendp library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It performs internal validation, boundary testing, and custom domain/measurement creation. No external communication or malicious payloads are present. The minimal security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting the benign and testing nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and intended solely for testing library functionality. There is no malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risk detected.",
