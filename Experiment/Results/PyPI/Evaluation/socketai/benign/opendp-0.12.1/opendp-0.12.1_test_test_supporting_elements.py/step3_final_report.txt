{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for the OpenDP library, specifically testing transformations, domains, and primitive type handling to ensure correct functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test parameters and internal library attributes (e.g., '_PRIMITIVE_TYPES') during test execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, network activity, or system effects; the code performs internal computations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test inputs and internal attributes through transformation functions and assertions, with no external data or network communication involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of private/internal attribute '_PRIMITIVE_TYPES' for testing purposes; no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that exercises library functions related to domain and transformation creation. It does not handle external data, perform network operations, or manipulate sensitive information. The use of internal attributes is typical in testing contexts. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for the OpenDP library, with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
