{
  "purpose": "The code inspects functions in 'measurements' and 'transformations' modules whose names start with 'then_', verifying that each has a documentation string containing a link to a corresponding 'make_' function.",
  "sources": "Function definitions in the 'measurements' and 'transformations' modules accessed via reflection (dir, getattr).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external outputs, or external system interactions; static introspection only.",
  "flows": "Read function names and docstrings (sources) without passing data to external systems or executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static inspection with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static reflection to find functions starting with 'then_' in specific modules, asserting that each has a docstring containing a link to a 'make_' function. It does not process external input, perform network activity, or execute dynamic code. The logic is simple and standard for documentation verification. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor adjustment is that the risk score for Report 1 could be lowered from 0.9 to approximately 0.1, reflecting the static, safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static documentation verification script with no security threats, malware, or obfuscation. The scores across reports are appropriate, with a slight adjustment to the risk score in Report 1 for accuracy.",
