{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite that verifies whether functions starting with 'then_' in certain modules have proper documentation and links to their corresponding 'make_' functions.",
  "sources": "Input source is the pytest parameters for module and function selection; module attributes via dir().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from selecting functions, then checking their documentation content for specific links.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard testing practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing framework pytest and specific modules. It parameterizes tests over functions in 'measurements' and 'transformations' modules that start with 'then_'. It asserts that these functions have documentation and contain specific link patterns. The logic is straightforward, with no external data or system calls, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite verifying documentation consistency for specific functions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
