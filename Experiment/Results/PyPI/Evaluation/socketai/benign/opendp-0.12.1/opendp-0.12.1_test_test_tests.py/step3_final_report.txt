  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'opendp.prelude' module, verifying API functions and coverage.",
  "sources": "The 'request.session.items' data, used in assertions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed into sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'request.session.items' into assertions; no external or untrusted data affects system state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'None' as arguments in method calls like 'then_private_expr(None, None)', which are placeholders but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward test functions asserting the existence and behavior of 'opendp.prelude' functions. No external data processing, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation. The use of 'None' in method calls appears to be incomplete tests or placeholders, not malicious. The malware scores are correctly set to 0, and obfuscation scores are 0. The security risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, reflecting minimal concern due to incomplete tests but no actual security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its purpose as a simple, incomplete test suite. No adjustments are necessary.",
