  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the analyzed open-source dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, external communications, environment variable usage, input handling, and any suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, or any untrusted data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "From data input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file system), including any processing steps that could introduce risks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, unusual code constructs, or any behavior deviating from standard benign scripts.",
  "analysis": "All five reports indicate the code is benign, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting limited code visibility. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk scores are mostly 0.2, but given the benign descriptions, a slight reduction to 0.1 is justified to better represent the low threat level. No significant anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified. The scores are internally consistent and appropriate based on the provided information.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are reasonable; however, reducing the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 would more accurately reflect the low-risk assessment. All reports are consistent in their findings, and no further action is necessary unless additional code or context suggests otherwise.",
