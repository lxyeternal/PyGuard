  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is provided due to lack of comments or context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, input functions, and possibly external files or network requests (if present in the unseen code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, or data output functions that could transmit untrusted data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network calls or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates the code utilizes standard Python libraries and functions. No malicious payloads, obfuscated logic, or suspicious operations are detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual control flows are present. The structure seems typical for utility scripts. Without specific external network or system commands shown, there is no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for open-source utility scripts. Due to limited visibility of external interactions, confidence is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
