  "flows": "Input from request.POST/GET to redirect_to_login after URL validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; standard monkeypatching and URL validation.",
  "analysis": "The code enhances Django admin security by requiring OTP verification and ensuring safe redirects through URL validation. Monkeypatching is controlled and standard for customization. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or supply chain risks are present. The URL validation mitigates open redirect vulnerabilities. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate security enhancement with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0), unobfuscated nature (0), and minimal security risk (approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
