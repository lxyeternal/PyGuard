  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for two-factor authentication views and plugin integrations in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Import statements, app configuration iteration, URL pattern definitions, include calls for plugin URLs.",
  "sinks": "The include() function with dynamic app_config.name, app_config.url_prefix, and app_config.name .urls.",
  "flows": "Apps get_app_configs() -> For each app, if name matches pattern, include app's URLs into main urlpatterns.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic include() with app_config.name, which could potentially be manipulated if app_config values are maliciously altered, but this depends on trusted app configs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No external network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports URL configuration modules and dynamically appends URL patterns based on registered apps. It specifically includes URLs from plugins with names starting with 'two_factor.plugins.'. The include() function is called with app_config.name and app_config.url_prefix, which are derived from app configurations. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or suspicious data handling. The logic relies on Django's app registry, which is a standard and safe approach, assuming app configs are trusted. No insecure data processing, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The pattern appears safe and standard for plugin URL inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration for a two-factor authentication system, dynamically including plugin URLs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It relies on trusted app configurations to include plugin URLs safely.",
