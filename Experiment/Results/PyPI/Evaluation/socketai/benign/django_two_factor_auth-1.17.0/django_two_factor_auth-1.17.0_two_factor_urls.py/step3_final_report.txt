  "purpose": "Defines URL patterns for core two-factor authentication views and dynamically includes plugin URLs based on app configurations in a Django project.",
  "sources": "App configurations retrieved via apps.get_app_configs(), which provide app-specific attributes such as name, label, and url_prefix.",
  "sinks": "The include() function incorporating plugin URL patterns; relies on trusted app configs; no untrusted data processed.",
  "flows": "App configs are iterated; for each, if conditions are met, their URL patterns are included via include(), forming the overall urlpatterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The dynamic inclusion depends on trusted app configs.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs URL patterns for core views and dynamically includes plugin URLs based on app configs. It uses standard Django practices with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The inclusion of plugin URLs is conditional and relies on trusted app configurations, which is common in Django projects. No untrusted input is processed, and the code structure is straightforward. The risk primarily depends on the trustworthiness of installed plugins, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Django URL configuration for a two-factor authentication system with plugin support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The dynamic plugin inclusion is a common pattern assuming trusted app configs. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal, around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting slight concern over plugin trustworthiness but generally safe.",
