  "purpose": "Defines URL patterns for two-factor authentication views and plugin integrations in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Django apps registry (apps.get_app_configs), URL configuration, string literals for URL paths, imported views.",
  "sinks": "Django URL resolver functions (path, include), dynamic URL inclusion based on app configs.",
  "flows": "App configs are iterated to include plugin URLs, which are then added to main urlpatterns; views are mapped to URLs for user authentication flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. Use of app configs and URL inclusion is standard. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs URL patterns for core, profile, and plugin components of two-factor auth in Django. It safely utilizes Django's app registry and URL inclusion mechanisms without executing any untrusted code. No malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to Django conventions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL configuration for a Django two-factor authentication system, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It dynamically includes plugin URLs safely, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
