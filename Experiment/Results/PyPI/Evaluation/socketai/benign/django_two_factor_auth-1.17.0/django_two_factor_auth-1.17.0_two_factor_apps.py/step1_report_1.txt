  "purpose": "Configure Django app for two-factor authentication and optionally patch the admin interface at startup.",
  "sources": "Access to Django settings (settings.TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN) and import of patch_admin() from local module.",
  "sinks": "Calling patch_admin() function, which may modify admin behavior based on settings.",
  "flows": "Code reads setting 'TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN'; if true, imports and executes patch_admin() to modify admin interface.",
  "anomalies": "Use of getattr with default True is standard; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports or code execution. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass for 'two_factor'. In the 'ready' method, it checks a configuration setting 'TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN' with a default of True. If the setting is enabled, it imports 'patch_admin' from the local module and executes it. The import is conditional, which is common for optional patches. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The import and function call are standard practice for applying patches or modifications during app startup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Django app configuration that conditionally applies a patch to the admin interface based on settings. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident.",
