  "purpose": "Configure the Django app for two-factor authentication and optionally patch the admin interface.",
  "sources": "Access to settings.TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN via getattr, import of patch_admin from local admin module.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of patch_admin() which may modify admin interface behavior.",
  "flows": "If settings.TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN is True (default), then patch_admin() is imported and called, potentially altering admin behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of getattr with a default True to conditionally execute code; no hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code. The patch_admin function's content is not shown, so its behavior cannot be fully evaluated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django app configuration that conditionally executes a local function patch_admin based on a setting. It uses safe practices such as getattr with default, and the import is within the method, limiting scope. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The risk hinges on what patch_admin does, but from this code alone, nothing malicious appears.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django app setup for two-factor auth with conditional patching. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet alone.",
