  "purpose": "Configure Django application for two-factor authentication and conditionally patch admin interface.",
  "sources": "settings.TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN, the import of patch_admin, and the call to patch_admin() in the ready() method.",
  "sinks": "The import of patch_admin and execution of patch_admin() function.",
  "flows": "From settings.TWO_FACTOR_PATCH_ADMIN to the conditional check, then to the import of patch_admin, and finally executing patch_admin().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The patch_admin() function is imported dynamically and invoked conditionally, which is standard practice for patching or initializing components.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django AppConfig subclass that sets up a two-factor authentication feature. It checks a setting and, if enabled, imports and runs a patch_admin() function to modify the Django admin interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration pattern for Django apps to modify or extend admin functionality based on a setting. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
