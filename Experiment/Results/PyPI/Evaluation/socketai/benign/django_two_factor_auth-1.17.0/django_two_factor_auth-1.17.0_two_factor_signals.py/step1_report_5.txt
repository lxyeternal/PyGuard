  "purpose": "Define a Django signal named 'user_verified' to notify when a user has been verified, with additional parameters such as request, user, and device.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow since the code only defines a signal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django 'Signal' class and creates a single signal 'user_verified'. This is standard practice in Django applications for event notification. There are no input sources, no data processing, no suspicious or malicious code. It simply establishes a signal for later use within a Django app.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of a Django signal with no suspicious or malicious intent. It appears to be part of a typical Django project setup, with no security risks or malware indications.",
