  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is a minimal Django signal declaration:\n     ```python\n     from django.dispatch import Signal\n\n     # Signal additional parameters are: request, user, and device.\n     user_verified = Signal()\n     ```\n   - All reports agree that this is a standard, benign signal declaration with no data processing, external inputs, or suspicious behavior.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues in this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a typical Django pattern for defining signals.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there is no need for justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is non-malicious, straightforward, and standard.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard Django signal declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates based on the entire context, I would agree with the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
