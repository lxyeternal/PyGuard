  "analysis": "The code imports the Django Signal class and declares a signal named 'user_verified'. It includes a comment indicating additional parameters for the signal: request, user, and device. There are no external data sources, no data processing, or data sinks. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as a part of Django's event system. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are apparent from this snippet.",
