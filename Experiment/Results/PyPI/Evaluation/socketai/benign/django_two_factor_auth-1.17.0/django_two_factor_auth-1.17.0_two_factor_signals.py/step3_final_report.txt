  "purpose": "Define a Django signal named 'user_verified' to notify when a user is verified, potentially carrying parameters like request, user, and device.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Signal' from 'django.dispatch' and declares 'user_verified = Signal()'. No external data sources or inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows in this code snippet; it only declares a signal without processing or handling data.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist within this snippet; the signal is declared but not sent or received here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Django applications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Django signal declaration with no external inputs, data processing, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no security issues or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django signal declaration with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or modification is necessary.",
