  "purpose": "Define a custom Django signal named 'user_verified' to be used for event handling related to user verification.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code imports a Django module and defines a signal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines a signal without any processing or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process or pass any data, just declares a signal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard Django practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Signal class from django.dispatch and defines a signal 'user_verified' intended to handle additional parameters such as request, user, and device. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It is a typical Django pattern for creating custom signals. No external inputs, no data leaks, and no security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django signal definition with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
