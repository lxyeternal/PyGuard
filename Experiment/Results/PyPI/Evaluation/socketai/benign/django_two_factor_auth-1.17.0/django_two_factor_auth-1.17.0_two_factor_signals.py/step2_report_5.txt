  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply defines a Django signal named `user_verified`.\n   - There are no signs of errors, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior in the code snippet itself.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and aligns with standard Django practices.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not contain logical errors or misinterpretations.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No report suggests any hidden malicious intent or security flaw, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a signal declaration with no data processing, no external inputs, and no suspicious behavior, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code does not pose any security threat, so the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is indicated.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or obfuscated code.\n   - Malware score should stay at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they interpret the code as a standard Django pattern.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- While the reports are accurate, they could mention that, in a real application, the signal would be connected to handlers that process the `request`, `user`, and `device` parameters. However, since this is only a snippet, their absence here is not concerning.\n- No further action is necessary; the code is benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard Django signal declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are needed.",
