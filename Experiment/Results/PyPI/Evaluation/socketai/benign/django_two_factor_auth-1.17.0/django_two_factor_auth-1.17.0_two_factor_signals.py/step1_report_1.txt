  "purpose": "Define a Django signal named 'user_verified' to notify when a user verification event occurs.",
  "sources": "None explicitly present; the code only defines a signal object.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the signal is a definition without invocation or data flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward signal declaration with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Signal class from django.dispatch and creates a signal 'user_verified' intended to carry additional parameters like request, user, and device. The code is minimal and typical for Django applications to implement event-driven mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks within this snippet. No external data, credentials, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django signal declaration with no malicious intent or security issues identified. The code is benign and serves a common purpose in Django projects.",
