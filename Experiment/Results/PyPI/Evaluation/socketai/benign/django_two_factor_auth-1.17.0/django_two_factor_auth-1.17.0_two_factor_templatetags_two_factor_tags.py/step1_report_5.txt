  "purpose": "Provides Django template filters for retrieving actions and verbose actions related to two-factor authentication devices.",
  "sources": "The 'device' parameter passed to the filters, 'registry.method_from_device' method, and methods called on the returned 'method' object.",
  "sinks": "The 'method.get_action(device)' and 'method.get_verbose_action(device)' calls, which may process or output data based on 'device'.",
  "flows": "Input 'device' → registry.method_from_device(device) → method object → method.get_action or get_verbose_action with 'device' as argument.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling or network operations. Use of external registry and methods is standard for Django plugins.",
  "analysis": "The code registers two Django template filters that retrieve actions based on a device object via the registry. It relies on external 'registry' and 'method' implementations. The functions are straightforward getters without any data manipulation or insecure operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Since the 'registry' and 'method' objects are external dependencies, their behavior cannot be fully verified here, but their usage appears standard within the context of a Django 2FA plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a Django application providing template filters for 2FA device actions. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet. The use of external registry and methods is normal for such plugins, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.",
