{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django template filters for retrieving actions and verbose actions for 2FA devices.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'device' object passed into the template filter functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns the result of method.get_action() and method.get_verbose_action() which may process the device object.",
  "flows": "device object -> registry.method_from_device(device) -> method.get_action(device) / method.get_verbose_action(device)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; reliance on external registry for device methods.",
  "analysis": "The code registers two Django template filters that operate on a device object. It retrieves a method associated with the device from an external registry and calls methods to get actions and verbose actions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious external communications. The external 'registry' may define device-specific behavior, but this is expected functionality. No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. The logic appears straightforward and typical for a Django plugin system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Django template filters interfacing with an external device registry. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
