{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django template filters to retrieve actions related to two-factor authentication devices.",
  "sources": "Calls to 'registry.method_from_device(device)' and 'method.get_action(device)' / 'method.get_verbose_action(device)'",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; the functions return data obtained from registry methods, no data leaks or untrusted inputs handled directly",
  "flows": "Device input flows into 'registry.method_from_device', which returns a method object, then to 'get_action' or 'get_verbose_action' methods, and finally returned to the template",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of eval, exec, or obfuscated code. The registry usage is standard for Django plugins",
  "analysis": "The code defines two template filters that invoke methods from a registry to obtain actions related to devices. The functions depend on external 'registry' methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code does not process untrusted input directly, nor does it perform any insecure operations. The reliance on 'registry' methods suggests it is part of a plugin system, typical in Django applications, with no indications of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard Django template filter definitions used for rendering device actions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment. It is a typical extension of the Django templating system with external registry lookups.",
