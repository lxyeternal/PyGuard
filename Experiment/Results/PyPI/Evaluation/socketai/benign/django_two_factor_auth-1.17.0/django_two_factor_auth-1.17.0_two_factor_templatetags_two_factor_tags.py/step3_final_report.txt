  "purpose": "Defines two Django template filters that retrieve actions from an external registry based on a device.",
  "sources": "Calls to registry.method_from_device(device) and subsequent method.get_action(device) / get_verbose_action(device).",
  "sinks": "None directly; external registry methods could be sources if malicious, but within this code, no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input device -> registry.method_from_device -> method.get_action / get_verbose_action.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation to external methods; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code registers two filters that delegate to external registry methods to obtain actions. It relies on external components whose trustworthiness is outside this snippet. No malicious code, obfuscation, or insecure operations are present. The primary security concern is the external registry's integrity, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Django plugins, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk stems from external dependencies, which are outside the scope of this snippet. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; risk score is approximately 0.2 due to reliance on external methods.",
