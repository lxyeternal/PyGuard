  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of OTP URL generation and device management. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant vulnerabilities are detected. The minor security risk associated with URL-embedded secrets is typical for such schemes and manageable with proper external secret handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate. Overall, the code is safe and correctly scored."
