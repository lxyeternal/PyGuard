  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on source code patterns, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, external modules, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, file writes, or environment variable access; execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via data processing, dynamic eval/exec, or external communication pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, minimal comments, unusual variable naming, or suspicious import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution (eval/exec) in Report 1, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete malicious indicators. Other reports describe straightforward, benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations: low malware likelihood (0-0.1), moderate obfuscation suspicion in Report 1 (0.4), and low security risks (0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are high where code clarity is confirmed, and lower where only descriptions are provided. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code in all reports appears benign or inconclusive, with minimal suspicion of malicious activity. The scoring reflects this, with low malware and risk scores, and moderate obfuscation suspicion only in Report 1. The overall supply chain security posture is low risk, and the reports are consistent and justified based on the available information.",
