  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets and analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, files, network/system commands, or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, system modifications, or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, such as environment variables or files feeding into network calls or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, lack of suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate missing or incomplete code, preventing detailed analysis. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0—are appropriate given the lack of evidence. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern due to absence of suspicious activity. Confidence levels correspond to the completeness of information, with high confidence (1) when no code is present. The reasoning across reports is consistent, cautious, and justified. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The assessments correctly recognize the limitations posed by missing code and do not overstate risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk scores and zero malware/obfuscation scores are appropriate. The assessments are consistent and justified given the available information. No further action is necessary at this stage.",
