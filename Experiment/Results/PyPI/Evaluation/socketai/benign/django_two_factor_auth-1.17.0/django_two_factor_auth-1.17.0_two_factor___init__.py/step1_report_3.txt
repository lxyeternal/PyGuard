  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code appears to be absent or minimal.",
  "analysis": "The provided prompt contains no actual code to analyze. Without code content, there are no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies to evaluate. This lack of code prevents any meaningful assessment of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. The security risk is considered negligible, and confidence in this assessment is high due to the lack of code to review.",
