{
  "purpose": "The code implements Django forms for multi-factor authentication (MFA) using TOTP, including token validation, device registration, and user interaction forms.",
  "sources": "User input fields (token, method, understand, otp_token), device verification methods, settings for cookie age, and internal cryptographic functions (unhexlify, totp).",
  "sinks": "Verification functions (device.verify_token), database operations (saving TOTPDevice), validation errors, and form submissions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from form fields to validation methods, which call verify_token or totp functions; upon success, data is stored or processed; errors are raised on invalid tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious external network activity, and no unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Django form practices for MFA, with proper validation and cryptographic handling of secrets via unhexlify. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Validation logic is straightforward, and the use of cryptographic functions aligns with best practices. The scoring of malware as 0, obfuscation as 0, and risk as 0.2 is consistent with the code's security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of MFA in Django, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The assigned scores accurately reflect its security status.",
