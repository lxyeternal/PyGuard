  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code manages 2FA workflows securely, using standard libraries and practices. The use of `unhexlify` on the secret key is typical for TOTP secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard MFA implementation, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The key decoding via `unhexlify` is typical. Validation logic is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports—standard MFA logic, proper validation, no suspicious code or external calls. Use of `unhexlify` for secret decoding is normal.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; the risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, standard TOTP MFA implementation with no malicious indicators. Proper validation, no obfuscation, no external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with secure, legitimate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard, secure MFA code with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity. The consistent malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports show clear, readable code without obfuscation. Score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** The primary concern is whether any of these codes could be exploited or have vulnerabilities. The reported code is standard, well-structured, and uses established libraries. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting low but not zero residual risk due to potential implementation errors or misconfigurations.\n\n### Critical Points:\n\n- The decoding of the secret key with `unhexlify` is standard; however, if the key is externally supplied and not securely managed, it could be a risk, but this is outside the code scope.\n- No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- The code follows best practices for MFA in Django.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is clear and readable)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (low, consistent with the reports and code quality)\n\nThese scores reflect a secure, legitimate implementation of MFA functionality with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis is a clean, standard implementation of Django MFA forms, with no evidence of malicious activity.",
