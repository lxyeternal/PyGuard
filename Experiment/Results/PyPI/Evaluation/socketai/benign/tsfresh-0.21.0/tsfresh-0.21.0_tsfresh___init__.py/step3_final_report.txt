  "purpose": "Initialize the tsfresh package by exporting core submodules, setting version info, and configuring logging.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution(__name__).version, import statements for submodules, logging setup",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or code execution points",
  "flows": "Importing submodules and version info retrieval, no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward package initialization code",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup: imports key submodules, retrieves version info with exception handling, and sets up logging with NullHandler. No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected. All signals indicate benign, typical package initialization behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard __init__.py script for a Python package with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify it as such, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
