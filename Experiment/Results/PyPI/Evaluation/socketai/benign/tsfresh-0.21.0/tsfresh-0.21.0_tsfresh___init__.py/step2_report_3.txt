  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard package __init__.py script.\n- Imports key submodules (`extract_features`, `select_features`, `extract_relevant_features`).\n- Retrieves version info via `pkg_resources.get_distribution(__name__).version` with exception handling.\n- Sets up logging with `NullHandler`.\n- No user input, network activity, or external data processing.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues\n- **Presence of all code elements as described:** version retrieval, logging setup, submodule imports.\n- **No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code** are present.\n- **No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent**.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes\n- The code is straightforward; no logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The use of `pkg_resources.get_distribution(__name__).version` with exception handling is standard practice.\n- No external data handling or untrusted data processing.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning\n- **Obfuscated (0):** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware (0):** No malicious activity or code.\n- **Risk (0):** The code is a typical package init script with no security risks.\n\n### Justification for Scores\n- All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- The code is purely for package setup, with no dynamic code execution, no network, no data leaks.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what is visible.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness\n- The scores assigned in the reports (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign __init__.py script for a Python package. It performs standard operations: importing submodules, retrieving version info, and setting up logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nScores should remain at **0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk**, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
