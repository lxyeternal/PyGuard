{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the top-level module for the tsfresh package, exporting core submodules and functions, and manages versioning and logging configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module name (__name__) for version extraction, and imports functions from internal tsfresh modules. It does not process external input data or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing internal functions and obtaining package version info; no external data flows or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The version extraction relies on standard package metadata. Logging setup is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes the module by setting version info and configuring logging. It imports specific functions for feature extraction and selection. All operations are standard, with no network connections, code execution, or data leaks evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is well-structured, and its behavior aligns with standard Python package practices.",
