{
  "purpose": "Provides profiling utilities for runtime analysis of feature calculation functions in the tsfresh package.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and module data, uses cProfile and pstats for profiling, reads/writes files for saving profiling results, accesses defaults.N_PROCESSES for parallel processing settings.",
  "sinks": "Writes profiling data to a file, logs profiling completion message, potentially modifies defaults.N_PROCESSES which influences parallel execution.",
  "flows": "start_profiling() -> profiling data collection -> end_profiling() -> writes data to file; set_n_jobs() -> modifies defaults.N_PROCESSES -> used elsewhere for parallel processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard profiling and configuration patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements profiling utilities and parallel process configuration. It uses standard Python modules and the tsfresh defaults without any suspicious behavior. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are present. The only writable operation is to a specified file for profiling output, which is a normal behavior. Modifying defaults.N_PROCESSES influences parallelism but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on profiling and configuration for performance analysis. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
