  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or security issues:**\n   - All reports are based solely on descriptive comments (docstrings) indicating that the module contains internal utility functions.\n   - There is no executable code, data handling, or logic present in any of these snippets.\n   - No input/output, data flow, or external interactions are described or implied.\n   - The comments explicitly state that the submodule is for internal use only, which is standard practice and does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or logical mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that these are just documentation comments with no executable or malicious code.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude that the code is purely documentation with no executable elements or malicious intent, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores are justified and should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - They recognize that the code is non-executable and purely descriptive.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content, which is just documentation comments.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nGiven that the code is only a docstring with no executable or data handling elements, there is no security concern. The scores assigned are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
