  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure parallel/distributed processing framework for feature extraction, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight security risk score of 0.2 assigned in some reports appropriately reflects the inherent risk of executing untrusted user functions, but the code itself is benign."
