{
  "purpose": "A data distribution framework for parallel and distributed feature extraction tasks, managing data chunks and executing user-defined functions across multiple processing units.",
  "sources": "Internal data modules, standard libraries, user-supplied functions (via map functions), no external input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Internal processing results, no external data leaks or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data is partitioned into chunks, passed to worker functions, and results are gathered back; no external data flows or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard parallel processing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries (multiprocessing, Dask, tqdm) for parallel and distributed execution. It handles data partitioning, manages worker pools, and executes user-defined functions. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration is present. The only potential concern is executing user-supplied functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is a common pattern in such frameworks. The code is well-structured, documented, and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure parallel/distributed processing framework for feature extraction, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight security risk score of 0.2 assigned in some reports appropriately reflects the inherent risk of executing untrusted user functions, but the code itself is benign.",
