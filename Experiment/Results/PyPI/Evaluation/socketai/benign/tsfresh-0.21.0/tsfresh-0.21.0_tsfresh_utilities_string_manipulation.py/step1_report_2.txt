{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for extracting configuration parameters from column name strings and converting parameter dictionaries into string format for column naming conventions.",
  "sources": "Input strings for functions `get_config_from_string(parts)` and `convert_to_output_format(param)`.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not write data, perform network operations, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input string or dict flows into parsing and formatting functions without any external influence or data manipulation beyond string processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries (`ast`, `numpy`) for data parsing and formatting. Functions handle string manipulation, safe evaluation with `ast.literal_eval`, and type conversions. There are no indications of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No network operations, file access, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for string and parameter handling within a data processing context. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
