{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for extracting configuration parameters from column names and converting parameters back into string format for column naming, primarily for data processing or feature extraction workflows.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from the 'parts' parameter in 'get_config_from_string' and the 'param' dictionary in 'convert_to_output_format'.",
  "sinks": "The functions generate strings or dictionaries based on input parameters; there are no data sinks or external output operations.",
  "flows": "Input parts list is processed to produce a dictionary with parameter configurations, and a parameter dictionary is converted into a string format for column naming.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code uses standard Python libraries and safe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code employs straightforward string manipulation, list comprehensions, and safe evaluation via 'ast.literal_eval'. It does not perform any network operations, file handling, or execute untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The use of 'ast.literal_eval' is safe in this context as it only evaluates literals. The functions serve utility purposes for string parsing and formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module intended for configuration parsing and formatting. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. The logic is clear, and no malicious patterns are present.",
