  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing configuration parameters from string parts and serializing parameter dictionaries into string format for column naming.",
  "sources": "Input string parts (`parts`) for `get_config_from_string`, and parameter dictionaries (`param`) for `convert_to_output_format`.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate solely on internal data without external data sinks or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into Python objects via `ast.literal_eval`; dictionaries are serialized into strings for column naming.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with safe use of `ast.literal_eval`. The only minor note is the potential risk if inputs are externally controlled, but this is minimal given the context.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions: one for extracting configuration parameters from string parts, converting string literals into Python objects with handling for special values like 'nan' and 'inf'; the other for converting parameter dictionaries into a string format suitable for column naming, wrapping string values in quotes. Both functions use safe practices, notably `ast.literal_eval`, which only evaluates literals, reducing risk. No external data flows, network, or file operations are present. The code is simple, clear, and intended for internal data processing. No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only cautious note is that if input data (`parts` or `param`) are derived from untrusted sources, there could be a minimal risk, but in typical usage, this is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for configuration parsing and formatting. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks under normal controlled conditions. The assessments and scores in the reports are consistent and appropriate, with a very low security risk score (around 0.05 to 0.1) reflecting the minimal potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in data processing pipelines.",
