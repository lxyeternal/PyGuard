  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for configuration parsing and formatting. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks under normal controlled conditions. The assessments and scores in the reports are consistent and appropriate, with a very low security risk score (around 0.05 to 0.1) reflecting the minimal potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in data processing pipelines."
