  "purpose": "The code imports transformer classes from the 'tsfresh.transformers' package for use in sklearn pipelines.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tsfresh.transformers' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for trusted, open-source library classes. There is no executable code, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The imports are from a reputable package, and the code's simplicity indicates benign intent. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minimal security risk score in some reports (0.1) is unjustified given the benign nature; it should be zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup for importing transformer classes from a well-known library. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this, with minor adjustments to the security risk score to reflect zero risk.",
