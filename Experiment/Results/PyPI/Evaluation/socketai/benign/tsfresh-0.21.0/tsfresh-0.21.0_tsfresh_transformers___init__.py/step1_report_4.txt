  "purpose": "Import statements for transformers used in sklearn pipelines from the tsfresh library",
  "sources": "Import statements, specifically from tsfresh.transformers modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or potentially malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present; code only performs imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a known open-source library (tsfresh). There are no function calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The imported modules are typical components used for feature extraction and selection in machine learning pipelines. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of non-sensitive, standard library components with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
