{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set configuration parameters for a data processing or machine learning pipeline, involving parallel processing and statistical testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'NUMBER_OF_CPUS' via os.getenv",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leak points; no data output or external communication",
  "flows": "Input from environment variable affects 'n_cores' which influences process count; no data flows to external systems or sensitive outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The use of environment variables for CPU count is standard, and the parameters seem related to data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 'cpu_count' to determine the number of processing cores, defaulting to the environment variable 'NUMBER_OF_CPUS' or system CPU count. It defines several configuration variables related to processing chunks, profiling, statistical tests, and output directories. All parameters appear consistent with typical data processing setup, with no signs of malicious logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for a data analysis or processing task. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The usage of environment variables is appropriate and there are no suspicious code patterns.",
