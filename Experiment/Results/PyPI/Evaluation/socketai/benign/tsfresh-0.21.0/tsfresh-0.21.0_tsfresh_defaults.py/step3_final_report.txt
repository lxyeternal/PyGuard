  "purpose": "Configuration setup for parallel processing and testing parameters in a data analysis pipeline.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'NUMBER_OF_CPUS' and static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs processed.",
  "flows": "Reading environment variable to determine CPU count; setting configuration parameters based on system info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a trusted environment variable with a fallback, and sets static configuration parameters. It contains no dynamic code execution, network or file operations, or untrusted data handling. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The logic is simple and standard for configuration purposes, with scores reflecting the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, with high confidence. No improvements are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
