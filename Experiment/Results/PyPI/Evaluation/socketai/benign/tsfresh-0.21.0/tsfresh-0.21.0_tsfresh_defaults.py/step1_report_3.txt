{
  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration parameters for a data processing or analysis pipeline, setting environment variables, process counts, profiling options, and test parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'NUMBER_OF_CPUS' using os.getenv",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modifications observed",
  "flows": "Environment variable reading to determine number of processes; configuration variables set statically or via environment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward configuration setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 'cpu_count' from multiprocessing to determine the number of processing cores, using an environment variable with a fallback. It defines multiple configuration variables, mostly static or based on the number of cores. No functions, network calls, or data processing logic that could be malicious are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for a data processing pipeline with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
