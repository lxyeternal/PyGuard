{
  "purpose": "The code sets configuration parameters and environment variables for a multiprocessing data analysis or profiling script.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'NUMBER_OF_CPUS' using os.getenv",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is processed or output to external systems",
  "flows": "Environment variable reading influences 'n_cores', which determines 'N_PROCESSES' and other configuration flags",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors; all variables are configuration parameters",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines configuration settings, with environment variable reading for CPU core count. No external network connections, file modifications, or code execution of untrusted input is present. The parameters appear to configure multiprocessing, profiling, statistical testing, and output directories. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup for a multiprocessing statistical analysis tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The script simply initializes parameters based on environment variables and constants, which is standard practice.",
