  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a data processing or analysis script, involving parallel processing and profiling options.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'NUMBER_OF_CPUS' accessed via os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable input influences number of processes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious constructs observed. Variables are standard configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a single environment variable 'NUMBER_OF_CPUS' to determine the number of CPU cores for parallel processing. The rest of the code consists of setting configuration flags and constants for profiling, processing, and analysis tasks. There are no dynamic code execution, file writing of untrusted data, network communication, or other suspicious behaviors. All actions are within standard configuration practices for a Python data analysis script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup for a data analysis application with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
