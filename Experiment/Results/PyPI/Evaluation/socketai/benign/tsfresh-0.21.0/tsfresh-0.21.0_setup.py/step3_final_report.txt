{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for the 'tsfresh' package, generated by PyScaffold, used to configure and install the package.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, pkg_resources.require, and setuptools.setup; performs version check via require()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup() is called with fixed parameters, no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Version requirement check flows into setup() invocation if conditions are met; no other data flows or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and setup invocation, no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script that enforces a minimum setuptools version, then calls setup() with use_pyscaffold=True. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The version check is a common practice to ensure compatibility. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup file with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code is safe and appropriate for production use.",
