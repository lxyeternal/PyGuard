{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling and preprocessing time series data in DataFrames, including NaN/imputation, data slicing, and generating shifted time series windows for forecasting.",
  "sources": "Functions read input DataFrames, Series, and dictionaries; access DataFrame columns; and process data in memory. No untrusted external data sources or network input observed.",
  "sinks": "Functions perform in-place modifications, data filtering, and DataFrame manipulations. No data is transmitted externally, no system commands or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data is read from DataFrame or Series objects, processed through imputation, filtering, or shifting functions, and stored or returned after transformations. No external flows or data exfiltration points are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Warnings about non-uniform sampling are standard diagnostic messages. Use of standard libraries and no obfuscated language features.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes common data processing techniques: NaN and infinite value handling, index filtering, and time series windowing. It employs standard pandas and numpy functions with in-place modifications for efficiency. No code injection, network operations, or system calls are observed. The functions serve well-known roles in data preprocessing for time series analysis. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or privacy violations are detected. The presence of warnings for non-uniform sampling is a normal feature of data diagnostics, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for data preprocessing in time series analysis, with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs typical data handling tasks without external communication or covert operations. Overall security risk is low.",
