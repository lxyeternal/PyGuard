  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling DataFrame conversions, NaN/inf handling, and time series windowing for time series analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrames or dictionaries, accesses DataFrame columns, and performs in-place modifications.",
  "sinks": "In-place modifications of DataFrames; no external data leaks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Reads data from DataFrames; replaces NaNs and infinities; filters and slices data; generates shifted time series segments.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or external communication detected. Minor issue: 'astype' calls do not assign back, but this does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation, imputation, and windowing for time series preprocessing using pandas and numpy. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Functions modify data locally, with appropriate validation and warnings. Minor implementation detail: 'astype' calls should assign back to ensure dtype consistency, but this does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate, well-documented utility functions for time series data handling. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is very low.",
