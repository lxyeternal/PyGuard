  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply contains a docstring comment, a copyright notice, and a single variable assignment setting __version__ to a string. No input handling, no external data, no suspicious code constructs or behaviors. The version number appears static and hardcoded. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version declaration with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.",
