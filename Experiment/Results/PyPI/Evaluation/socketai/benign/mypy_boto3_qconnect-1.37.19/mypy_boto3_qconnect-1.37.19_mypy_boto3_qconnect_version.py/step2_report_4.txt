  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a comment and copyright notice.\n   - All reports agree that there are no dynamic elements, no input/output handling, and no suspicious code constructs.\n   - The code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The only minor note is the future year (2025) in the copyright statement, which could be a placeholder or outdated, but this is not a security concern.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1 or 1.0, reflecting high certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5 since there's no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities identified.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static and straightforward nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0               |\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
