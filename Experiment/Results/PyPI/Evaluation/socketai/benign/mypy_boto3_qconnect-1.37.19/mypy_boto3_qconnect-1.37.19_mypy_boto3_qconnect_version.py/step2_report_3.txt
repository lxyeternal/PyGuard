  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a comment. No dynamic behavior, no input/output, no external dependencies or data flows.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025) mentioned in some reports, which could suggest placeholder or outdated metadata, but this is not a security concern.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score: 0\n     - `obfuscated` score: 0\n     - `securityRisk` score: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No changes needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there is no justification needed for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is clearly non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code contains no malicious activity or behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but could be updated for accuracy.\n- The code is a standard, straightforward version declaration with no issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the current scores. The code is benign, and the reports are accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the code.",
