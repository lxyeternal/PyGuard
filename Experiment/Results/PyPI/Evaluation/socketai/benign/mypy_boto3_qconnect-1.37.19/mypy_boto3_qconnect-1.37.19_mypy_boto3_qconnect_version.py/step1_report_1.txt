  "purpose": "Define the version number for the package or module, serving as a source of truth for version control.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ from a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The static assignment of the version string is straightforward and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a version string assignment and a comment. It lacks any dynamic or malicious elements. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The only potential concern is the hardcoded version string, but this is standard practice in package versioning and not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It functions as a static source of version information without any harmful behavior.",
