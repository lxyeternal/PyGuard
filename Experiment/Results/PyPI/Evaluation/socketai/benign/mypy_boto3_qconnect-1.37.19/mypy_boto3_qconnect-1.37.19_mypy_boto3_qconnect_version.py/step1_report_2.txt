  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025) that may indicate placeholder or outdated information, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is standard in Python packages. There are no inputs, external data reads, or suspicious code constructs. The only notable aspect is the copyright year being in the future, which could suggest placeholder data or outdated metadata, but this does not pose security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but might warrant update for accuracy.",
