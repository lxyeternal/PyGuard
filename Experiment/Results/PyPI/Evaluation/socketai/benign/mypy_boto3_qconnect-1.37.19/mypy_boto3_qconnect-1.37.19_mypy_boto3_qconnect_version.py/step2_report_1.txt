  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their assessments:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is a static assignment of a version string with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Fully accurate; no issues here.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Findings:** Notes the future copyright year (2025) as potentially unusual but not malicious.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct; the future year is likely a placeholder or oversight, not a security concern.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward version declaration, no malicious code.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Findings:** Consistent with others; static version string, no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Findings:** Same as above; simple static assignment, standard practice.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n   - **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string. No dynamic or malicious elements are present.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly zero; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, as expected.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The only minor note is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not impact security and is not malicious.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is benign, standard version declaration, with no security concerns.",
