  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow exists beyond setting a static variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version string, no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment setting __version__ to a static string. There are no input operations, no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The version string is hardcoded, which is typical for package versioning. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a metadata indicator for the package or module.",
