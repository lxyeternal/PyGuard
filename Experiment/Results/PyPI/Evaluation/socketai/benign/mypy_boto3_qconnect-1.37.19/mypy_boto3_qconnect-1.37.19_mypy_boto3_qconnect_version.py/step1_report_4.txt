  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only assigns a version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a value to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a simple string assignment for the '__version__' variable with a copyright notice. It lacks any dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions. No obfuscated elements, malicious functions, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard version declaration typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
