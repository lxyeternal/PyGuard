  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or outputs are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or outdated info, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward and minimal; it matches the description in each report.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code itself.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard for version declaration.\n- The mention of the future year (2025) as a potential placeholder is accurate but not problematic.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n### Review of scores:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious elements.\n- No changes needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code is static, straightforward, and has no malicious behavior, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The reports correctly assign a risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- No malicious activity or behavior is present or implied.\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they only describe the code's function.\n- The only questionable aspect is the future year, which is not a vulnerability but a metadata issue.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard version declaration, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No external data, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- The only minor note is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
