  "purpose": "Define the version of the package in a static manner.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.19' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "The future copyright year 2025 is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with a comment. No dynamic code, input/output, or external dependencies are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or oversight. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. The code poses no security threat, and the scores are consistent with its simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for version declaration, with no malicious or security concerns. The only note is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports are accurate and appropriate.",
