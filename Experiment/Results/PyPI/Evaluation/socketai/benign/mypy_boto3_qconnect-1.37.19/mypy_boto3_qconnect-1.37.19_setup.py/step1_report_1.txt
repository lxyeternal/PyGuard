  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-qconnect package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; reading package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data influences security-sensitive operations or data leaks",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description, then passing static metadata and configuration to setup() function; no untrusted data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected; all code appears standard and static",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional Python setup configuration. It reads the README.md file for description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. All data used is static or from trusted sources. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution occurs. No potential attack surface or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely configures package metadata for distribution without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
