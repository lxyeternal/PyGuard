{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-qconnect', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static strings defining package metadata, import statements, and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Static data (package info) flows from constants and file reads into the setup() function, with no dynamic or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a static README.md file, and calls setuptools.setup() with hardcoded package information. All data are static strings or file content, with no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code follows typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior or malicious code components.",
