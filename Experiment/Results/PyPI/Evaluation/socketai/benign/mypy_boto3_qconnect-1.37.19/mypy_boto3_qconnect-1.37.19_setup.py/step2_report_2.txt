  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a module.\n- It reads a static README.md file for the long description.\n- It defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, URLs, etc.\n- No user input, network communication, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is present.\n- All data are static or file-based, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes a typical setup script reading README.md and static data.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no untrusted data influence, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; code is safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static nature and standard practice.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- Confident in the safety assessment.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Also describes a typical setup script, with no external or untrusted data involved.\n- No anomalies or malicious code detected.\n- Accurate conclusion.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Same observations: static data, no dynamic or untrusted input, standard setup code.\n- No suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Consistent with others: reading static README.md, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk score:** Appropriately zero, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero; no malicious actions or payloads.\n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree and the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.",
