  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python module 'mypy-boto3-qconnect' with static metadata and README content.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.md file; uses hardcoded package metadata; no untrusted input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used throughout, no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup code with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script that reads a static README file and defines package metadata. It involves no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging practices. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and static nature support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
