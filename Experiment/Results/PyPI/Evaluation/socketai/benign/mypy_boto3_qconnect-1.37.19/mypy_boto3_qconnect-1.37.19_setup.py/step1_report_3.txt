  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-qconnect Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for long description during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the script performs standard setup tasks with proper package metadata and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations for a Python package, including reading a README file for description and defining package metadata. It uses standard libraries and practices for package configuration. No input from external or untrusted sources is processed dynamically; no network connections or execution of arbitrary code occur. The script does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. All code is static and conventional for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script appears legitimate and free of malicious behavior. It performs standard package configuration without any suspicious or malicious activities.",
