  "purpose": "Static type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 QConnect client, providing method signatures and overloads for IDE support and type checking.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type annotations, import statements, and documentation links; no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external effects, or untrusted data processing; purely static interface definitions.",
  "flows": "Limited to method parameters and return types; no execution or data flow beyond type hints.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; standard autogenerated SDK stub.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static type stub for the boto3 QConnect client, with no runtime logic, secrets, or obfuscation. It uses overloads and detailed type hints to facilitate IDE features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The documentation links and structure are standard for such SDK stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, autogenerated SDK interface stub with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It serves solely for static type checking and IDE support.",
