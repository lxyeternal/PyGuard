  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the boto3 QConnect service, providing methods for interacting with the API.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party botocore, and local modules for paginator and type definitions. Method definitions unpacking request types and returning responses.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No code writes to files, executes system commands, or performs network operations directly. No untrusted input handling or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls unpack request type definitions from kwargs and return corresponding response types. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly interface definitions, with extensive use of type annotations, overloads, and property methods. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class with methods corresponding to API operations, using type annotations to specify request and response types. The imports include standard and external libraries, and the class properties and methods are straightforward. No evidence of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of overloads for get_paginator method is standard for boto3 client stubs. Overall, the code appears to be a clean, well-structured interface definition for the boto3 QConnect client without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface definition for a boto3 client with extensive type annotations. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The code appears safe and typical for SDK interface definitions.",
