{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client method definitions for the qconnect service Client, providing structured API access.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore modules, and internal modules; method signatures with kwargs unpacked from type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. The methods mainly define API interactions with no evident data sinks or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "User calls API methods which unpack input data from predefined type definitions; no data flows to external systems or network connections within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. All functions are straightforward wrappers around AWS service calls, with type hints and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a Python client interface for the AWS QConnect service with detailed type annotations, method overloads for pagination, and clear documentation links. No code executes dynamic or malicious actions. It relies on external libraries and type definitions for operation, with no embedded or hidden code behavior. The absence of any network activity, data manipulation, or system modification code indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a structured API client interface with type safety and documentation. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and purely for API interaction purposes.",
