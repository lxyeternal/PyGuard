{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client method definitions for the boto3 QConnect service, providing a structured interface for interacting with AWS QConnect.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard library, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions including property and overloads; docstrings with URLs; no external user input handling or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types; no code executes with untrusted data; no direct data leaks or external effects identified.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flow from method input parameters (mostly kwargs unpacked from predefined types) to responses; no flow leads to unsafe operations or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and documentation; no executable code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic; the structure aligns with auto-generated type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type declaration and client interface for AWS boto3's QConnect service, with no runtime logic or data processing. It uses type overloads and property definitions to facilitate type checking. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The presence of URLs, licensing, and structured method signatures suggest autogenerated stubs, not malicious code. The code strictly defines interfaces and does not perform any operations or contain executable logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type annotations and method signatures for the boto3 QConnect client, designed for static type checking and IDE support. It does not contain executable code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
