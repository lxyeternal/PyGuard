{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various string-based constants used in the qconnect service for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types for use in type annotations. No runtime data handling, user input, or network operations are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The structure and content are consistent with standard type annotation definitions for a Python SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of type aliases for string literals used in type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign module intended to improve code clarity and type safety.",
