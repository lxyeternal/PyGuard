  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code solely defines string literal types as type aliases for use in static type annotations.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no runtime data flows, external inputs, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns are present.\n- The purpose is to improve type safety, documentation, and code clarity in the SDK.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define Python type literals for constants used in `qconnect`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code is static, benign, and purely for type annotations. No malicious behavior or security risk is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literals for type safety.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. The code is static, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define constants for type safety and documentation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign static type definitions. No dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for constants, for static type checking.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or obfuscated code; purely static definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar static type alias definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward static type alias definitions.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.0** — No external data handling, secrets, or dynamic code.\n\nThe code's purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support within an SDK, which is standard practice and carries no inherent security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My Expert Estimate**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — No malicious intent or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — Fully transparent static definitions.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** — No security vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent with the code's content. All evaluations correctly identify the benign nature of this module. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:** This is a safe, well-structured static type definition module with no security concerns.",
