  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a large collection of string literal type aliases used for static type annotations.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- The code contains no runtime logic, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The purpose is to improve type safety and code clarity within an SDK or codebase.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature and static, declarative intent of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n\n- **Presence of code:** The code matches the description—defining string literal types for constants.\n- **Malicious code or anomalies:** None detected. No backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.\n- **Data flow or sinks:** None. No runtime data processing or external data handling.\n- **Obfuscation or secrets:** None. The code is straightforward and static.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n### Logical or reasoning flaws:\n\n- The reports are consistent; no flawed reasoning or inaccuracies are evident.\n- The import pattern and the content are standard for type definition files.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, justified because the code does not introduce security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Any need for score adjustments?\n\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The code is purely static type annotations, serving as a helpful, standard part of a type-safe SDK.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malicious intent, or malicious payloads.\n- The code is well-structured, with proper version compatibility handling.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type safety.\n\n**My final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis supply chain report indicates no security concern.",
