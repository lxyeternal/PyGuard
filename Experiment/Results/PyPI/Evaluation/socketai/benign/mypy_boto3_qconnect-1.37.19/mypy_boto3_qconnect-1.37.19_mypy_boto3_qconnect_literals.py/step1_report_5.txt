{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations for various string literals used in the qconnect service, primarily to provide type safety and documentation for API parameters.",
  "sources": "The source of data is hardcoded string literals used for type annotations, not external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or used; the code solely defines constants for type hints.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this code only establishes type aliases for static code analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward and solely for type hinting. No dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', then defines numerous string literal types for use as type annotations in the qconnect service. All definitions are static and serve as type hints, improving code clarity and safety. No input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code contains licensing and documentation comments but no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for API literals, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as static type annotations to aid development and code correctness.",
