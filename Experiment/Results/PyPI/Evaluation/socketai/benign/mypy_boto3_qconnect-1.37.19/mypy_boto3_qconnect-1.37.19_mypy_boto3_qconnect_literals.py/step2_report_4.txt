  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining string literal types for type safety.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code includes a version check for importing `Literal`, which is standard practice.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code.\n- The purpose is to improve type safety and documentation, not to execute logic or handle data.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: a collection of type aliases for string literals.\n- No anomalies, malicious patterns, or security risks are detected across all reports.\n- The structure and content are consistent with a benign static type definition module.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** all reports assign 0.0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** all reports assign 0.0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- No issues are observed. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The high confidence (1.0) across all reports aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured static type definition module.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors.\n- The scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are appropriate and should remain at 0.0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, purely for static type annotations, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign static type alias module.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- Scores are correctly assigned as zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and correctly scored.",
