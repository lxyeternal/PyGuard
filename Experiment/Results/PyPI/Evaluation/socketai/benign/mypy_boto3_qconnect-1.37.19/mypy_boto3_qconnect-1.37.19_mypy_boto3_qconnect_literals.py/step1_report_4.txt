{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various constants used in the qconnect service, providing type annotations for static type checking.",
  "sources": "The code imports sys for version checking; defines string literals directly in the module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input sources or output sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution. The version check for 'typing.Literal' is standard practice for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'sys' to check Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines multiple string literal type aliases used for static typing. The '__all__' list specifies exported names. There are no functions, dynamic code, external data processing, or suspicious constructs. The module appears to be a straightforward type annotations definition for the SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions for constants used in the SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
