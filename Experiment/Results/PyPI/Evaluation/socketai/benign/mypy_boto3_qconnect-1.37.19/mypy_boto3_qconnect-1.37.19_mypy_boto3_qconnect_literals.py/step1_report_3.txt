  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various constants used in the qconnect service for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors. The code consists solely of type annotations and string literal definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations for constants via Literal types. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version. No data input, network activity, or system modification code present. The code appears to be standard type declaration for constants, with no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It does not execute any external commands or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotations defining string constants for the qconnect service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
