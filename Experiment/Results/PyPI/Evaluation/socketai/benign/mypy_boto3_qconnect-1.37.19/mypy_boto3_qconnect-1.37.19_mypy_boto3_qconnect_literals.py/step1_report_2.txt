  "purpose": "Define type annotations for string literals used in the qconnect service to improve type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions in the module, primarily at the bottom, which specify acceptable string values for various types.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling, input/output, or external data processing is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is purely static type annotations with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to conditionally import Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version, then declares a large number of type aliases as string Literal types. These are used for type checking and do not perform any runtime operations or data processing. The entire module is static and solely intended for type annotations. There are no code injection, malicious behaviors, or data leakage mechanisms present. The code does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted inputs, nor does it contain any executable logic beyond static type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a standard type definition file for improving type safety with no malicious intent, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It serves solely as static type annotations for various string literal types used within the qconnect service context.",
