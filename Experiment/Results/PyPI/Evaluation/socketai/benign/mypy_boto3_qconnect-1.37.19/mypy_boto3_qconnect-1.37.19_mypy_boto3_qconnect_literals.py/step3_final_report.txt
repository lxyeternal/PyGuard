{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for constants used in qconnect service for static type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only declares string literal type aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime data flows, external data handling, or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Static definitions with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining string literal types for type safety, with conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, static, and purely for documentation and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for string literals, serving as a part of SDK type safety. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.",
