  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the findings are justified, whether the scores align with the content, and if any adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description; code defines paginators, sourcing data from method parameters passed to the underlying paginator classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or execution paths involving untrusted data; data flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is boilerplate for SDK bindings.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, well-structured, and safe. Confidence is high (1). Malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining paginator classes with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is purely structural.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states safety and legitimacy. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining type-safe paginator classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; the structure is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly concludes safety and legitimacy, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded, no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines paginator classes with type annotations, importing type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling, network, or file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses conditional imports for compatibility; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately assesses the code as benign, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) possibly due to the conditional import pattern, but still reasonable.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated:** Correctly scored as 0, given no malicious activity.\n\n**Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.1) due to the conditional import pattern, but this is a common pattern for compatibility, not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, boilerplate nature.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign very low risk (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the consistent and accurate analysis across all reports, and considering the code is standard boilerplate for SDK paginator classes with no malicious or suspicious patterns, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (minimal security risk, purely structural code)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the content and the nature of the code. No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be auto-generated or boilerplate SDK bindings, which are common and safe, and the reports' evaluations are consistent with this understanding.",
