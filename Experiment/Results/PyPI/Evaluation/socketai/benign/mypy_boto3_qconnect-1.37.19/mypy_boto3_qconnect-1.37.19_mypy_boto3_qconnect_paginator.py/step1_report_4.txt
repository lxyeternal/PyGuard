{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the qconnect service client with type annotations for use in boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Imported sys, type annotations, botocore.paginate, and custom type definitions; class methods with **kwargs for pagination.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, network, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources to sinks; pagination methods invoke boto3's paginator with parameter unpacking.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears structured for type-safe paginator definitions; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class definitions for pagination over various qconnect API endpoints. It extends Paginator classes with paginate methods, using type unpacking and type definitions. No code writes to or reads from network, files, or environment variables. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected. The imports and method implementations are straightforward, serving as a type-safe wrapper around boto3's paginator functionality. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-annotated paginator definitions module for boto3 qconnect service. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, serves a clear purpose, and adheres to standard patterns. It appears safe and intended solely for type safety and code completion support.",
