{
  "purpose": "Defines type-safe paginator classes for the boto3 qconnect client, facilitating iteration over paginated API responses with static type annotations.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (**kwargs) passed into 'paginate' methods, which are forwarded to the underlying PageIterator or Paginator objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; the code only creates and returns paginator objects without executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method arguments into paginator instances; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is boilerplate SDK stub code with conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from generic Paginator types, with 'paginate' methods annotated to accept specific request parameters and return PageIterator objects. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The structure is consistent with auto-generated SDK bindings, and documentation links confirm its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of SDK paginator class definitions with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as boilerplate for type-safe iteration over API responses in the boto3 'qconnect' client.",
