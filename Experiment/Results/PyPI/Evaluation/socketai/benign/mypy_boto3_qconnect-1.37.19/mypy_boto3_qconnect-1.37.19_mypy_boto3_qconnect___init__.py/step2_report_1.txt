  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward SDK interface module that imports classes from local modules, sets up aliases, and exports symbols via `__all__`.\n- No reports mention any dynamic code execution, user input handling, network operations, or data processing beyond imports and class definitions.\n- The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright date \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the data training cutoff (October 2023). This could be a typo or placeholder, but it does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code based on the reports and analysis.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None identified. The reports correctly interpret the code as a standard SDK interface setup.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of security issues.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year \"2025,\" which might be a typo or placeholder but does not impact security.\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits. They correctly identify the code as a benign SDK interface.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n## Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n**1. Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n- Based on the code review, I agree with the assigned scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**2. Additional Considerations:**\n- The future copyright year \"2025\" is unusual but not malicious. It might warrant a correction or clarification but does not impact security.\n\n**3. Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a clean, standard SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all the reports and the actual code content.",
