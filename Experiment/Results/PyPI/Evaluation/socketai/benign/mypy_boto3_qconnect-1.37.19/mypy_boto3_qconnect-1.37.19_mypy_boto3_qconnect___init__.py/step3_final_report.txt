{
  "purpose": "Provides an SDK interface for the qconnect service, importing classes and setting up module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and class definitions; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Static import and export setup; no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module, consisting of import statements, class aliasing, and export definitions. It contains no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The only minor anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The structure and content suggest a standard, safe SDK setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent across reports.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
