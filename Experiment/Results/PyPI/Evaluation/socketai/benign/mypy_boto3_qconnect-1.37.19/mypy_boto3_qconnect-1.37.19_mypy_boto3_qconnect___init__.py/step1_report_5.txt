  "purpose": "Provides an interface and imports for the qconnect service, enabling interaction with various paginators and the main client.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), and inline code comments.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly imports and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The copyright date is in the future (2025), which might be a typo or placeholder but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, class aliasing, and defining __all__ for export. It includes comprehensive documentation comments demonstrating usage. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or external data handling present. No code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is detected. The future-dated copyright does not impact security but is unusual.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package interface file.",
