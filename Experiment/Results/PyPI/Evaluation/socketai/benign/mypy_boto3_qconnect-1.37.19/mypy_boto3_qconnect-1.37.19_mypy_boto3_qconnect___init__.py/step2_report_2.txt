  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward SDK interface module, primarily importing classes and defining exports.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing involving untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is well-structured, with documentation and usage examples.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future-dated copyright (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo but not malicious.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's nature—nothing malicious or obfuscated is present.\n- I agree with these assessments.\n\n**Security risk and purpose:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the code's static import/export structure.\n- The purpose is consistently identified as providing an SDK interface for the 'qconnect' service, which is accurate.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n\n- The scores of 1 for confidence seem high but justified, given the clarity and straightforwardness of the code.\n- The other scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all 0, consistent with the code content.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- No issues are found with the code itself.\n- The reports do not mention any external dependencies or runtime behaviors that could introduce risks.\n- The only unusual point is the copyright date (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nBased on all reports and my review, I concur with their assessments. The code is a standard, safe SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is clean, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. No further action needed.",
