{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exposes a client class and various paginator classes for the 'qconnect' service, facilitating interaction with the service's API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: '.client' and '.paginator', and the module's own namespace declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external network calls, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports classes and assigns the client class to a variable; there are no data flows or execution paths that process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and mainly consists of import statements and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python SDK, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of external inputs, and no suspicious operations. The presence of copyright information and documentation links does not indicate malicious intent. No unusual code or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It solely defines imports and exports for a client library, with no external data processing or potential attack vectors.",
