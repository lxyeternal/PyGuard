  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, potential inconsistencies, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a straightforward SDK interface with no input/output, no network operations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no malware, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent; the code is a typical SDK interface with no malicious indicators. The score of 0 for malware and risk is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard import/export setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no network, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent. No signs of malicious activity. The score of 0 for malware and risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, no external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, with documentation demonstrating safe usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data, network, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, with a note about the future copyright date (2025).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no secrets. The future date is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence due to the unusual copyright date, but it doesn't indicate malicious intent. The scores remain appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard SDK interface setup with no dynamic execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is justified given the static, import-only nature of the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are zero, indicating no security risks, which aligns with the code's characteristics.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High (1 or 0.95), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely an import/export module for an SDK, with no runtime behavior that could be malicious.\n- No external data, secrets, or network operations are present.\n- The documentation and structure are typical for SDK modules.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**In conclusion, the provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.**",
