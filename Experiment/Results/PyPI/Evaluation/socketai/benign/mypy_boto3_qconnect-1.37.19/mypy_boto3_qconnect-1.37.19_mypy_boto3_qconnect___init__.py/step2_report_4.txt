  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the validity of their claims, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any security concerns are justified.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward SDK interface module, mainly importing classes and defining exports.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual report reviews**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; describes the code as an SDK interface with no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No data leaks or untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; the code is a typical SDK module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The score aligns with the analysis. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; the code is an import/export setup.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid; straightforward module setup, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; similar to previous.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; documentation mentions client creation, but no dynamic code.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No untrusted data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the only oddity is the future copyright date (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code remains a standard SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct; detailed documentation and import structure.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual point is the future copyright date (2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The high confidence score is justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard SDK interface module, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security concerns.",
