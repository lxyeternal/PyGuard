{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point that outputs package information or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no external or untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input: Command-line argument '--version' in sys.argv -> Output: version info or package info printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing package information and version details based on command-line input. It imports sys for input/output operations, defines simple functions for printing static information, and uses a main guard to execute logic. There are no network operations, no file manipulations, and no handling of untrusted input beyond command-line args, which are checked explicitly. The code does not contain obfuscated elements or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It simply outputs predefined package metadata based on user input, with no suspicious or harmful operations.",
