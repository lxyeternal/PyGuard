  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n- It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine whether to print version info (`--version`) or package info.\n- It writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No secrets, credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present. The code is straightforward, static, and benign.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; the code does not perform any harmful operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Data leaks or untrusted data sinks:** No; only static info is printed to stdout.\n- **External dependencies or network activity:** None.\n- **Secrets or credentials:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n- All five reports consistently describe the script as a benign CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details.\n- They all correctly identify the data flow: command-line argument parsing (`sys.argv`) leading to printing static info.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or security concerns are reported or observed.\n- Confidence levels are all 1, and scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0. Since the code is purely informational with no malicious intent, this score is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. No obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The script poses no security risk; it’s a benign utility.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, static CLI utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. It simply outputs package metadata based on user input, with no external or untrusted data involved.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a safe, benign script with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior.",
