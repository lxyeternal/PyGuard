  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version number based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> conditional check -> print_info() or print_version() -> sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI script that outputs package info or version based on a command-line argument. It uses only standard library modules, performs simple argument checking, and writes static strings to stdout. No external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or secrets are involved. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with high confidence. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
