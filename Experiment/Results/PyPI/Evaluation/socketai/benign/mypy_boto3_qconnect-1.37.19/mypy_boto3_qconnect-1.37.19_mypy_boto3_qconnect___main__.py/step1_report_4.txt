{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details about a Python library related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Input is read from sys.argv, specifically checking for the '--version' argument.",
  "sinks": "Output is written to sys.stdout via sys.stdout.write(). No untrusted data is written, only static information.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in command line arguments, the code flows from the source (sys.argv) to the sink (print_version output), otherwise it flows from main() to print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward printing functions without any obfuscated or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that checks for '--version' in sys.argv and prints static package information or version number. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data flows. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no credential handling are present. The code's structure is clear, and it strictly outputs static, non-sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and intended for informational purposes only. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply displays package info and version details. Overall, the code is safe.",
