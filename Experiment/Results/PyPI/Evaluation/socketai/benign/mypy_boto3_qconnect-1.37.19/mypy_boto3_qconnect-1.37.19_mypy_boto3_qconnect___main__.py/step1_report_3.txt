  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing info and version details about boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (input from command line), sys.stdout.write (output to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (potentially leaks info if misused, but no untrusted data source involved)",
  "flows": "Command line argument (source) leads to conditional logic that triggers printing version info or package info (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded strings are informational, no secrets or credentials present, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines simple functions to print static package info and version to stdout. It checks command line arguments for '--version' and prints accordingly. No input validation issues, no external data dependencies, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and uses only standard library functions with static strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security issues. It serves informational purposes only.",
