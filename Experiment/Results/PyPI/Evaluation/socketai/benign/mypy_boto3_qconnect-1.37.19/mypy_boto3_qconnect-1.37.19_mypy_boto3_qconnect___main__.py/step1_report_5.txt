{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point to provide package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data sources or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input from command-line arguments (sys.argv) triggers conditional flow; output is printed to stdout based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes based on command-line input. It does not perform any network operations, data collection, or system modifications. It simply responds to specific arguments with static information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code. The code's structure and behavior are typical for CLI utilities providing package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI script that outputs package information and version details. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
