  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version details based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only the standard library (`sys`), with no external dependencies.\n- It performs straightforward conditional logic: if `--version` is present, it prints version; otherwise, it prints package info.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, file I/O, or handling of untrusted input beyond explicit argument checking.\n- All output is static, hardcoded strings.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities or malware are evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors?**  \n  None detected. The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n\n- **Security flaws?**  \n  No. The code does not handle untrusted input in a risky way; it only checks for a specific argument and outputs static info.\n\n- **Obfuscation or malicious constructs?**  \n  No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Issues in the Reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature of the script.\n- No overestimation of risk or malware.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and static nature of the code, and the comprehensive, consistent reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
