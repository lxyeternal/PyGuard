  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses `sys.argv` to detect `--version` and writes to `stdout`.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Findings:**\n   - All five reports uniformly describe the script as benign, straightforward, and purely informational.\n   - They correctly identify that the script does not perform any network, file, or untrusted data handling.\n   - They note the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in their benign assessment.\n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, appropriate since the code is clear.\n   - **Malware score:** 0, consistent with no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Security risk:** 0, as the script does not introduce vulnerabilities or perform risky operations.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the reports' consistent conclusions, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n   - The reports seem thorough and accurate.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't present.\n   - The code does not do anything malicious or suspicious.\n\n5. **Overall Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - The code is benign, serving only to display static information.\n   - Malware score remains at 0.\n   - Obfuscated score remains at 0.\n   - Security risk remains at 0.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code and the reports.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (benign utility)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the true nature of the script.",
