  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a package, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs package info and version)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) influences whether print_version or print_info is called; output flows to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it provides package information via CLI commands. It reads command-line arguments to determine whether to print version info or package details. The outputs are written to stdout. There are no signs of data leaks, external data fetching, or malicious behavior. The script is minimal and adheres to normal CLI behavior without any suspicious patterns or embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic CLI output functions for package info and version display. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility script.",
