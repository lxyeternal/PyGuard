  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version number based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses only standard library modules (`sys`) and performs straightforward operations.\n   - There are no external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` output hardcoded strings to stdout.\n   - The logic is simple: if `--version` is in `sys.argv`, print version; otherwise, print package info.\n\n2. **Issues and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of malicious intent.\n   - No data leaks, no external data fetching, no dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No suspicious data sinks; only stdout is used for output.\n   - The code is benign and purely informational.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are warranted.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Additional Justification:**\n   - Since the code only outputs static info, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n   - The confidence in these assessments is high (all reports indicate the same).\n\n6. **Overall Estimation:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, I agree with the provided scores.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Current Score | Justification / Recommendation                                  |\n|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0               | No malicious activity detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               | Clear, straightforward code.                                   |\n| Security Risk  | 0               | No vulnerabilities or risky operations present.                |\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
