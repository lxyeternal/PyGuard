  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any security concerns, inconsistencies, or potential malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and data models for a qconnect service SDK, no external input or dynamic code.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is declarative, defining data schemas.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, standard SDK data models with high confidence (1.0). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—type annotations for data models, no external input handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or malicious code. Static type definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, with high confidence (0.9). No malware present.\n\n**Assessment:** No security concerns; the code is purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—defining data schemas for API entities.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, external calls, or suspicious patterns. Standard Python typing practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, safe, with full confidence (1.0). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for SDK, no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-supported, safe, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others—type annotations and data schemas.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully consistent, no malware, high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports indicate zero, which is consistent with the static, declarative nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk:** The code is purely type annotations and data models, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or executable code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a comprehensive, well-structured set of static type definitions for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be purely declarative, serving as data schemas for API interactions.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No further action needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
