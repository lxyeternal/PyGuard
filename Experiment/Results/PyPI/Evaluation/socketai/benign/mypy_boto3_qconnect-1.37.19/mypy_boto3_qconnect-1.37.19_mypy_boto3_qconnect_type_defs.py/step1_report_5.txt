{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the qconnect service in a Python SDK, primarily for data validation and type checking.",
  "sources": "The code defines class-based data schemas (TypedDict) and type aliases, with no input or data reading operations; it also imports various type annotations and literals from external modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points involving untrusted input; no code executes based on input, nor is there any network or file operation, or command execution.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code strictly defines types and data schemas without runtime logic or data handling code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code solely contains type definitions, import statements, and structured data schemas. No dynamic code execution, external command invocation, or embedded payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations, data structure definitions using TypedDict, Union, and Literal, as well as import statements for typing and literals. It includes no functions, runtime logic, or data processing. The data schemas are extensive but standard for data validation in a typed Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, code injection, or sabotage. The code is purely declarative and used for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the qconnect service SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural, aiding in static type validation and code correctness. No evidence of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present.",
