{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data model definitions for the qconnect SDK, including request/response schemas, configurations, and data structures. It is purely declarative, intended for static type checking and API schema representation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, constants, and import statements. No runtime data input, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted data at runtime, nor does it include network calls, code execution, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "None. The code is static type definitions with no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "None detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors. The code is standard for SDK data schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility. It does not contain executable logic, external data processing, or network activity. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, following standard Python typing practices, and serves as data schemas for API interactions. The absence of runtime code, dynamic evaluation, or external calls indicates a purely declarative purpose, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of static type definitions for a Python SDK. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence and zero malware score are justified.",
