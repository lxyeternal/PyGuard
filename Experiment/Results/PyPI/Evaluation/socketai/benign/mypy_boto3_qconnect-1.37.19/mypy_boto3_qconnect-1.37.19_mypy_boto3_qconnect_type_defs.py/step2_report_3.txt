  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report to identify any inconsistencies, potential risks, or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** The report states the code is a set of type annotations and data structures for the qconnect service SDK, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. It is standard for SDK data schemas.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both are zero, consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to the first, focusing on type annotations and data models, with no external input processing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies or malicious patterns. The code is static, primarily for type safety.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both at zero, matching the purely declarative nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious indicators; the code remains safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Again, type annotations and data schemas for a Python SDK.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, dynamic code, or external calls. The code is purely for data modeling.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both at zero, consistent with the static definitions.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as above, defining data models with no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies or malicious patterns detected. The code is standard for static type definitions.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both at zero.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** Clearly safe, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Content:** Consistent with previous, static type definitions for SDK.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data processing.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both at zero.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** No security risks or malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is composed solely of static type annotations, data schemas, and class definitions for a Python SDK related to a qconnect service.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or network operations that could be exploited.\n- **Consistency:** All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the static, declarative nature of the code—extensive type annotations, data models, and conditional imports for compatibility—there is no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a well-structured SDK schema definition, which is common and safe.\n\n### Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious patterns. No further action needed.",
