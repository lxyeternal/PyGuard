{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and data structure definitions for various entities within a Python SDK or client library related to a bot or AI service, such as agents, prompts, content, and configurations.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class and variable definitions, imports, and Union/List/Dict structures defining data models. No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or execution points that process untrusted or external input; the code solely defines data types and structures without executing code, data processing, or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows, input processing, or data transformations; all code is static type definitions and class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is purely type annotations and data model definitions with no logic or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of structured TypedDict and Union definitions used for static type checking, documentation, and ensuring data consistency within a Python SDK. It imports standard modules, conditional imports for compatibility, and defines data models with no runtime logic, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. There are no suspicious behaviors, dynamic code execution, or potential injection points. The code is purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of data type definitions for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform data processing, external input/output, or command execution, and appears to be safe for use. The overall security risk score is low.",
