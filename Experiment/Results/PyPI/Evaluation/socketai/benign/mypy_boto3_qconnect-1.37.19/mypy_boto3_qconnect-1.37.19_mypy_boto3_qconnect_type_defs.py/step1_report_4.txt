{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for qconnect service, mainly used for defining request and response schemas, configurations, and data models within the service.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, datetime, typing), and local modules (literals). Definitions of TypedDicts, Unions, and Literals for various data models and request/response schemas.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing functions are present. The code primarily defines static data structures and types without executing external commands or processing untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows or untrusted data processing flows are present. The code consists solely of type definitions and data models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code is purely declarative with no executable logic, external data fetching, or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly defines various TypedDicts, Unions, and constants for a Python SDK or API client. It employs conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or I/O operations that could be exploited. The code follows standard patterns for type annotations and data schemas. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely composed of type definitions and data schemas for a service SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a safe and standard implementation for modeling data in a Python project.",
