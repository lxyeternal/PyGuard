  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for qconnect service, including request/response schemas, configuration types, and associated data models.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and variable declarations throughout the code; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily defines data structures and type annotations without runtime execution or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "None; static type definitions and data models without data flow logic or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of type annotations and class definitions appears standard for SDK or API client code. No suspicious function calls or external network interactions are present. No obfuscation or hidden code signatures identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is predominantly composed of TypedDict class definitions and type annotations for a Python SDK dealing with a qconnect service. It includes import statements conditioned on Python version, but no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network operations. The code is well-structured, clearly documented, and aligns with typical data model definitions. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns are evident. All data models serve to structure request and response payloads, with no runtime or malicious activity apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-formed set of type definitions for a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be purely declarative, serving as data schemas for API interactions. No malicious intent or security risks are identifiable based on static analysis.",
