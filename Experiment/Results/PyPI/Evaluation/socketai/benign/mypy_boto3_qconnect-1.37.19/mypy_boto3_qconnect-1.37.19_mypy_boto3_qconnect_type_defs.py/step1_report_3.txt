  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for qconnect service API.",
  "sources": "All class and type definitions, especially TypedDict and Union constructs, along with import statements.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include data serialization/deserialization, API request/response handling, and data validation points.",
  "flows": "Sources are type definitions; flows occur when these types are used in API operations, data exchange, or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code execution, code injection, or dynamic code evaluation observed. Use of type annotations and data models appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of structured type definitions using TypedDict and Union, with no runtime code, no data processing logic, or code execution pathways. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. Usage of external type literals and annotations is consistent with standard Python typing practices. Import statements are safe, conditional imports based on sys.version_info are standard for compatibility, and there is no evidence of malicious behaviors such as network activity, data theft, or malicious code execution. Overall, the code appears purely for type safety and data schema definitions without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains extensive data structure definitions for a service API, employing safe, standard Python typing. No malicious activity, sabotage, or malware indicators are present. The code is solely for data modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
