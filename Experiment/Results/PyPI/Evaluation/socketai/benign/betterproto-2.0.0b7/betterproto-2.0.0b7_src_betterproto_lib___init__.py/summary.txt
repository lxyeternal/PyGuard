  "conclusion": "The dependency contains suspicious obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns that warrant cautious scoring. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the patterns justify elevated malware and security risk scores for reports 1 and 2. Benign reports are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, but slight score increases for reports 1 and 2 could be considered for more conservative security posture."
