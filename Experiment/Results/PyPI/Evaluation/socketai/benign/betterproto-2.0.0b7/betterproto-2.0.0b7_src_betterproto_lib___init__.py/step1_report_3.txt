  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic Python script potentially designed for data processing or automation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external data files or network sources (if present in omitted sections).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs. Specific sinks are not visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, function args) through processing functions to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are immediately visible. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from standard input methods such as environment variables and function parameters. It uses standard Python libraries without evident malicious imports. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscated strings, or unusual control flow. The structure is typical of data processing scripts. Due to lack of network calls, cryptography, or system manipulation code, there's no apparent malicious intent. The absence of hardcoded secrets or backdoors further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activity detected. Confidence in this assessment is high given the limited scope.",
