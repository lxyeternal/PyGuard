  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, untrusted input sources, dynamic code execution points such as eval()/exec(), network or file I/O, potentially obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, system commands, file operations, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution pathways.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, untrusted inputs) leading to sinks (network, system commands) via dynamic evaluation or obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with unverified input, obfuscation (base64, dynamic code), hardcoded IPs/domains, suspicious imports, variable name obfuscation, inconsistent code clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns typical of obfuscated malicious scripts, including dynamic code execution and hardcoded network indicators. Benign scripts show straightforward data handling without suspicious constructs. Suspicious patterns justify higher malware and security risk scores, while benign patterns align with low scores. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic evaluation, not confirmed malicious payloads. Scores for suspicious code are appropriately cautious, with potential slight adjustments upward if confirmed malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains suspicious obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns that warrant cautious scoring. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the patterns justify elevated malware and security risk scores for reports 1 and 2. Benign reports are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, but slight score increases for reports 1 and 2 could be considered for more conservative security posture.",
