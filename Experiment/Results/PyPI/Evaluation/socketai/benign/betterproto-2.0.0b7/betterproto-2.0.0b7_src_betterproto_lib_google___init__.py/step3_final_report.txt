  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, user input, external files, network sources, or system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, or data exfiltration points where untrusted data could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from sources like environment variables or user input to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected in the provided snippets.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify no malicious or suspicious code, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. The reasoning aligns with the benign nature of the code, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
