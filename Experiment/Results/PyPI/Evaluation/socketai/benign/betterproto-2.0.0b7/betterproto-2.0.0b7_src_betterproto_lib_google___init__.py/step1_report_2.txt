  "purpose": "This source code appears to implement a data processing or utility function, but without further context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, possibly input files, or user inputs (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console, logs, or network connections; possibly writes to files or databases.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks like output functions or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL or IP connections, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or malicious functions like system commands, code execution, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data handling routines, with no signs of malicious activity such as data leakage, backdoors, or unauthorized network access. Usage of third-party libraries is typical; no unsafe practices detected. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalies like obfuscated segments or suspicious behaviors are present. Without external context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code functions as a typical utility or data processing module with no suspicious behaviors observed.",
