  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, correctness of the assessment, and the appropriateness of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  The code is a straightforward import statement. No data flows, sinks, or malicious activity are evident.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reasoning**  \n  The report correctly notes that wildcard imports can be discouraged but are not malicious. The conclusion is sound.\n\n- **Scores**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — no evident risk.  \n  - Overall risk: justified as zero.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, just an import statement. No data handling or malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws**  \n  The report mentions the risk of wildcard import but emphasizes that it’s not malicious. The security risk is slightly elevated at 0.1, which seems cautious but acceptable.\n\n- **Scores**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — minimal, due to wildcard import.  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Same as previous, a benign import statement.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws**  \n  The report correctly states that no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Scores**  \n  All zeros for malware and obfuscated, security risk is zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  The import is a wildcard, which can obscure imported components.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws**  \n  The report correctly notes that this practice can hide malicious components if the package is compromised, but the import itself is not malicious.\n\n- **Scores**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly elevated due to wildcard import, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue Present?**  \n  Same as previous, a wildcard import.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws**  \n  The analysis is consistent, emphasizing that the risk depends on the trustworthiness of the package.\n\n- **Scores**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — acceptable given the wildcard import.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is just an import statement with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly elevated (0.1 or 0.2) due to the use of wildcard imports, which can be a security concern if the package is compromised, but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could be flagged for best practices, but not for malicious intent.\n- No evidence suggests malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — due to wildcard import, but overall low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
