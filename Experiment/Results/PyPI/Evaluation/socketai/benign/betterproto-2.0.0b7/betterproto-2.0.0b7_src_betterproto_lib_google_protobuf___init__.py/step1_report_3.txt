  "purpose": "Import all standard protobuf classes and functions from the betterproto library's google.protobuf module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data flows or processing occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement; no anomalies, secrets, or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement importing all contents from a standard protobuf module within the betterproto library. There are no functions, variables, or code execution, and no indication of malicious behavior or malicious intent. Since it's only an import, the code's purpose is likely to enable protobuf serialization/deserialization. No suspicious activity or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
