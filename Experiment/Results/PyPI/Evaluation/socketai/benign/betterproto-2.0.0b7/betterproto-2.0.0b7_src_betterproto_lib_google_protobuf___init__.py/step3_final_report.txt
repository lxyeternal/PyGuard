  "purpose": "Import protobuf classes/functions from the 'betterproto' package for serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from 'betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import is static and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import '*' which can obscure imported symbols but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, with no executable logic or malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of '*' in the import, which can hide imported symbols and potentially obscure malicious components if the package is compromised. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the passive nature of the code and the potential risks associated with wildcard imports. The trustworthiness depends on the package source, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent. The main issue is the use of wildcard import, which is a best practice concern but not an active security threat. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low security risk reflects the passive nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
