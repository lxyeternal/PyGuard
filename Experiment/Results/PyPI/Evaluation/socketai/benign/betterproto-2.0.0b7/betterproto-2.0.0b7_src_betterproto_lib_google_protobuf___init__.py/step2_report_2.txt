  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement; no malicious code or data flow.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; the import is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; a simple import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report mentions that wildcard imports can be risky but not malicious—accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (due to wildcard import), obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The minor security risk from wildcard import is acknowledged.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, just an import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No direct malicious code, only import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The concern about wildcard import is valid but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (due to wildcard import), obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The risk from obscured imports is acknowledged.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; passive import.\n- **Errors or flaws:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (from wildcard import), obfuscated=0 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure imported components but are not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence suggests malware or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import practices, which are generally discouraged but not malicious)\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis. The highest security risk stems from the wildcard import, which could hide malicious components if the package were compromised, but in this context, there's no evidence of such.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which should be avoided for clarity and security auditing but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and justified.",
