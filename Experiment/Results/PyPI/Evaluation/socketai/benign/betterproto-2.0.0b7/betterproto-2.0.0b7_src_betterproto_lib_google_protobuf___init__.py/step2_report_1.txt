  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf import *`.\n- None of the reports identify any actual malicious activity, code execution, or data leakage.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of a wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious or unintended components if the package is compromised.\n- The code itself is benign and standard for setting up protobuf serialization/deserialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code only performs an import; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.\n- The use of `*` import is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports correctly identify the risks associated with wildcard imports but do not overstate or misinterpret the benign nature of the code.\n- They reasonably note that trustworthiness depends on the package source, which is appropriate.\n- No report suggests that the package is malicious or compromised; they only flag potential risks.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the risk associated with wildcard imports and third-party trust.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- Confidence levels vary but are generally high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nScores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports or the code itself justifies a risk score higher than 0.5.  \n- The main concern is the wildcard import, which is a coding practice issue, not an active threat.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n- The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the actual risk depends on the trustworthiness of the package.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores align well with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import and third-party trust considerations)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the context, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects that the code is benign but acknowledges the potential issues with wildcard imports and external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is standard and non-malicious, with the primary concern being import practices rather than security vulnerabilities.",
