{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'betterproto' package using importlib.metadata or a fallback for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata import, metadata.version() call",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks or output functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source of the package version (metadata.version) does not involve untrusted data flow or external inputs; it simply reads package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs a standard package metadata query with a fallback for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'metadata' from importlib for Python 3.8+ and falls back to importlib_metadata for earlier versions. It then retrieves the version of 'betterproto' using metadata.version(). This is a common pattern for package version retrieval and does not involve any malicious activity or suspicious code behavior. There are no external data inputs, no obfuscation, and no malicious sinks. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign snippet for obtaining package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
