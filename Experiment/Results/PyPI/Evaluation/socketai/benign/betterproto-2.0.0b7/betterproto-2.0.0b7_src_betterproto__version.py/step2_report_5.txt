  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core functionality: importing `metadata` from `importlib` (or fallback to `importlib_metadata`) and retrieving the version of `betterproto`.\n- The code is straightforward, standard, and does not involve any external data input, network activity, or data sinks.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected in any report.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None are evident. The code is a standard pattern for package version retrieval.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports — correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 in all reports — correct.\n  - Security risk: mostly 0 or 0.1 — appropriate, given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Potential for higher risk or malware?** No. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Any assumptions about vulnerabilities?** No, all reports correctly state that the code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 in some reports is acceptable, considering the minimal security concern related to package metadata access, but overall, the risk is negligible.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the code's simplicity and benign nature, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since no security risk exists)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard, safe pattern for retrieving package version information, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores and analysis are appropriate.",
