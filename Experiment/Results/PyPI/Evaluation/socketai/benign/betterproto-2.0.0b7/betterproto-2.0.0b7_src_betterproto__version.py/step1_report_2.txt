{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'betterproto' package using importlib.metadata, compatible with Python versions before 3.8.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load 'metadata' from importlib or importlib_metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Import and version retrieval occur during module import; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'metadata' from 'importlib' and falls back to 'importlib_metadata' for older Python versions. It then retrieves the version of the 'betterproto' package using 'metadata.version'. There are no inputs, no data processing, or untrusted data handling. The logic is straightforward and standard for package version retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign approach to obtain package version information. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
