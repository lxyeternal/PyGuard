  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'betterproto' package using importlib.metadata or its fallback for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward version retrieval",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'metadata' from importlib for Python 3.8+ and falls back to 'importlib_metadata' for earlier versions. It then retrieves the version of the 'betterproto' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. It solely reads package metadata without performing any external network activity, data leakage, or executing untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard method to obtain package version information, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
