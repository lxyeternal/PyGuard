  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'betterproto' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements and 'metadata.version' function call to obtain package version.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Importing the module, then fetching version info; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'metadata' from 'importlib' for Python 3.8+ or falls back to 'importlib_metadata' for older versions. It then retrieves the version of the 'betterproto' package. The code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or system modifications. There are no obfuscated elements or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign package version retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
