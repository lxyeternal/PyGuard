  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'betterproto' package using importlib.metadata or its fallback for older Python versions.",

  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for obtaining package version information, involving no external input, network activity, or data sinks. It uses well-known Python modules with no suspicious or malicious constructs. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and security profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly overcautious but acceptable; it can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is free of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
