  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly overcautious but acceptable; it can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is free of malicious activity or vulnerabilities."
