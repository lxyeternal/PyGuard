{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'betterproto' package.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'metadata' from 'importlib' or 'importlib_metadata' depending on Python version, then calls 'metadata.version' with 'betterproto'.",
  "sinks": "The code only accesses package metadata; no sinks such as network, file write, or untrusted input processing are present.",
  "flows": "The source of data is the package metadata, which is used directly to obtain the version; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. The use of conditional import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'metadata' to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It then retrieves the version of a specific package, 'betterproto'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific, performing only benign package metadata retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for accessing package version information, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
