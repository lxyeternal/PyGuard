{
  "purpose": "Import all components from the 'betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf.compiler' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module import statement.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if the imported module contains malicious code or backdoors, but the import statement itself is not a sink.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads the entire module, which could include malicious code if the module is compromised, but no direct flow of untrusted data is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard '*', which can obscure what is being imported, but this is common in package imports and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing all definitions from a specific submodule within 'betterproto'. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. The import does not by itself execute malicious code but relies on the integrity of the package. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious patterns are evident. Given only this line, the risk depends on the trustworthiness of the 'betterproto' package.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard module import with no explicit malicious behavior detected. However, reliance on external package integrity is necessary. No malware or malicious activity is indicated within this snippet.",
