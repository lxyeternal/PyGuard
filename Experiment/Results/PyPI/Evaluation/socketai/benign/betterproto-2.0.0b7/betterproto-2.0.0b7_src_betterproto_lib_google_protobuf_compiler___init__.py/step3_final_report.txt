  "purpose": "Analyze the provided import statement for potential malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies to assess supply chain security concerns.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf.compiler'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted sinks or data flows are present; the code is a static import.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported components and is considered poor practice but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no executable code, data processing, or network activity. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which can lead to namespace pollution and maintainability issues. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent are detected. The malware score is set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), justified by the import style concern but not indicating actual threat. Confidence in the benign nature is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of an import statement. The main issue is the use of wildcard import, which is a style concern rather than a security threat. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low security risk score. No further action is necessary.",
