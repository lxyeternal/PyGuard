  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Content:** Import statement from 'betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf.compiler'\n- **Assessment:** No data flows, sinks, anomalies, or suspicious behavior. It’s a straightforward import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Content:** Import all symbols from 'betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf.compiler'\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, no data flow or malicious activity. The only concern is the use of a wildcard import, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malicious activity, just a note on best practices.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Content:** Import all components from 'betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf.compiler'\n- **Assessment:** Use of wildcard import is less ideal but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8\n- **Justification for scores:** The securityRisk is minimal; the primary concern is the wildcard import which could hide imported elements, but it’s not inherently dangerous.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scores. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Content:** Import all modules from the same package.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, with emphasis on the potential for namespace pollution due to wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk due to wildcard import obscurity, but no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Content:** Same import statement.\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the import is standard, with reliance on package trustworthiness.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports identify the code as a simple import statement, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure what is being imported but are not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting minor concerns related to best practices rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal security concern, a score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import, but no actual threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The import statements are benign in this context, and no further action is necessary based solely on these lines.",
