  "purpose": "Import all modules from betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf.compiler",
  "sources": "Import statement as a source of code execution or data reading",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this line; potential impact depends on imported modules",
  "flows": "No data flow evident from the import statement alone",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can mask what is being imported, which may hide malicious or unnecessary modules; potential for namespace pollution",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement that imports everything from a specific module within betterproto. No code execution, data reading, or suspicious behavior is directly observable from this statement alone. However, wildcard imports can obscure what functions or classes are being loaded, possibly hiding malicious or unintended components if the module itself is compromised. The module path indicates it is part of the betterproto library, which is an open-source protocol buffers implementation, but without additional context or code, no malicious behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This line is a simple import statement. It does not exhibit malicious behavior on its own. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure imported elements. No malicious activity or security issues are evident from this single line, but further context or code is needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
