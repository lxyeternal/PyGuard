  "purpose": "Importing modules from the 'betterproto' library, specifically related to Google Protocol Buffers compiler functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'betterproto.lib.std.google.protobuf.compiler'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks observed; no data output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows; just an import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import statement, no obfuscated code or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement from a third-party library, 'betterproto'. There are no data inputs, user interactions, or dynamic code execution. The import appears standard and does not involve any suspicious or malicious constructs. As this is only an import, it does not pose any security risks by itself. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement of a library module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a Python project that depends on 'betterproto'.",
