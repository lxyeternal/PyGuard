{
  "purpose": "Define type variables for type hinting and conditional imports for gRPC message types.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own type hints and conditional imports within the 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and conditional imports, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' for optional type hints is standard; no suspicious or unusual code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports type hints used for static type checking only, avoiding runtime overhead. It defines two TypeVars with bounds referencing 'Message' and 'IProtoMessage', respectively, facilitating type hinting for subclasses or implementations. No code execution or data handling occurs; the code is straightforward and adheres to common Python typing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard typing setup for a gRPC-related module with no malicious intent or security concerns. It contains no obfuscated, malicious, or risky elements.",
