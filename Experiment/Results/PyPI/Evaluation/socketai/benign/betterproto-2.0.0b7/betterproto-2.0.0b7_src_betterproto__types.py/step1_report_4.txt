  "purpose": "Define type variables for use with protocol message classes, facilitating type hinting and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TYPE_CHECKING, TypeVar, and conditional imports within the TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no runtime data handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely type hinting and import management.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for conditional imports is standard; no suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type variables for class methods that return 'self', enabling precise type hints for subclasses. It conditionally imports types for static analysis purposes only, avoiding runtime overhead or external dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no use of untrusted data, and no obfuscation or hidden behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for type hinting and static type analysis in Python projects. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
