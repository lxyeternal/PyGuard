  "purpose": "Define type variables and conditional imports for type checking in a gRPC messaging context",
  "sources": "Conditional import statements under `if TYPE_CHECKING`",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only sets up type annotations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type variables and conditionally imports modules for static type checking. It uses Python's typing system to set up bounds for generics. The `if TYPE_CHECKING` block prevents runtime import overhead and is a standard pattern. No code execution, external data reading, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard type annotation setup without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
