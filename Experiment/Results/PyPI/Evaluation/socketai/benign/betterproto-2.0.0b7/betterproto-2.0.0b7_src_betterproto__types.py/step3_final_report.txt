{
  "purpose": "Define type variables T and ST for use in static type checking, bound to Message and IProtoMessage classes respectively, with conditional imports to avoid runtime overhead.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports within 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block, which are only executed during static type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not handle runtime data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type variables for static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, standard for type hinting, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python patterns for static type hinting: defining TypeVars with bounds and conditional imports guarded by 'if TYPE_CHECKING'. It does not process or handle runtime data, nor does it include any code that could be malicious or obfuscated. The purpose is purely for type annotations, which do not impact runtime behavior or security. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for static type checking in Python modules related to messaging classes. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scoring in the reports is appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
