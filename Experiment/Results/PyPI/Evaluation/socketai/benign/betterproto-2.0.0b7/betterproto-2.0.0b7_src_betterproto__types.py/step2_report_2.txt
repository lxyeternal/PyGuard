  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard for type hinting and conditional imports, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- The code only defines type variables and uses `if TYPE_CHECKING` to conditionally import modules for static analysis.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- The scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all zero across reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code matches the original code snippet exactly.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent, emphasizing that this is standard, benign code for static type checking.\n- No report suggests any potential vulnerability or malicious intent based on the code.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The security risk score is appropriately 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The code is safe, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus in the reports.\n\n**Final note:** No further action is necessary; the code is benign and well-understood.",
