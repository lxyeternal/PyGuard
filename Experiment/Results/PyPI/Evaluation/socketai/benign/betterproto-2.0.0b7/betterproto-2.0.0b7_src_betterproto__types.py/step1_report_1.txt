  "purpose": "Define type variables and conditional imports for type checking in a gRPC-related Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'typing' module for type annotations, and conditionally imports from 'grpclib._typing' and the local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present; the code is solely for type annotations and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not handle runtime data, only static imports and type variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The use of TYPE_CHECKING for conditional imports is standard; no suspicious or unusual code structures are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type variables T and ST bound to 'Message' and 'IProtoMessage' respectively, which are used for type hinting. The conditional import block ensures that certain imports are only evaluated during static type checking, not at runtime. This is a common pattern in Python to avoid circular dependencies or unnecessary import overhead. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for type hinting and conditional imports in Python projects, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
