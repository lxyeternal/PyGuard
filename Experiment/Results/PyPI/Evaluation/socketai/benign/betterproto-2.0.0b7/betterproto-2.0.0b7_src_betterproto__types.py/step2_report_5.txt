  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is standard for type hinting with conditional imports, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusion: standard pattern, no issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same reasoning; the code is typical for static type annotations.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also standard, no suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments; no issues found.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely for type annotations and conditional imports, with no runtime data handling, no external data processing, and no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign zero or negligible scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** No reason exists to justify higher risk scores since the code is standard and benign.\n- **Malware considerations:** The malware score is zero across all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- **Overall coherence:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a typical, benign pattern used in Python projects for static type checking, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
