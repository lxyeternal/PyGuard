{
  "purpose": "A sophisticated custom enum system utilizing metaclasses and protections to manage enum members, preventing reassignment and deletion, with support for iteration and mapping.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, class creation via type(), and internal mappings for enum members.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or data leaks; internal memory management only.",
  "flows": "Class attributes and methods access internal _value_map_ and _member_map_ to retrieve enum members; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom enum framework with metaclasses, using dynamic class creation and internal mappings to manage enum members. It enforces immutability of enum members through attribute restrictions. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code is complex but follows standard patterns for advanced enum implementations, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured custom enum implementation with protections against modification. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
