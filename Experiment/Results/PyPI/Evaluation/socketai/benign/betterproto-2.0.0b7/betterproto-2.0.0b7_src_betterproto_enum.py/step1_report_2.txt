{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom enumeration framework compatible with Python's enum, implementing dynamic class creation and member management for enumerations.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, attributes, and built-in functions such as hasattr, isinstance, and sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic class creation via type(), attribute setting, and access to class members, but no explicit data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining enum classes, creating enum members, and managing member access and iteration; no external data flow or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard patterns for class and enum creation, with no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom Enum system with class creation, member management, and iteration capabilities. It uses standard Python features such as __new__, __setattr__, and class properties. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The dynamic class creation via type() and attribute manipulations are standard for such patterns. No suspicious or unsafe operations are identified, and no external data or inputs are processed in an insecure manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of custom enumeration classes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows Python conventions and does not contain any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
