{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom enumeration system, including metaclasses and base classes, for handling enum-like types with additional features and protections.",
  "sources": "Reads include standard library imports, type checking conditionals, and class definitions that process input parameters for enum creation and access.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present. The code primarily manages in-memory enum structures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters for enum creation, lookups by value or name, and attribute setting/reassignment attempts form the primary data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code uses standard patterns for defining enums and protecting attributes. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom enum system via metaclasses and classes, with protective measures against modification of enum members. It includes mechanisms for creating enum types, mapping values and names, and restricting attribute modifications. No signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The functions and classes behave as expected for a utility module related to enum handling. There are no obfuscation techniques, suspicious dynamic code execution, or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of custom enum classes with safety protections. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this module.",
