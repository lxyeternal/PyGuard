{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom Enum classes with metaclasses for enhanced enum behavior and type safety, primarily used for protobuf enumeration representations.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, method parameters, and the namespace dictionary during class creation; also reads values passed to methods like try_value and from_string.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data externally. It raises exceptions for invalid inputs but does not send data over the network or store sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input data (values or strings) is used within methods to fetch enum members, but no external data flow or transmission occurs; internal lookups are performed safely.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or dynamic code execution, are present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom Enum class with a metaclass that manages enum members, mappings, and class behaviors. It includes type checking and compatibility code for different Python versions. It raises errors for invalid enum access. No external network, file I/O, or suspicious dynamic code is present. The structure appears standard and focused on enum management, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom enum classes intended for protobuf use. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs input validation and controlled attribute management without external data leaks or harmful actions.",
