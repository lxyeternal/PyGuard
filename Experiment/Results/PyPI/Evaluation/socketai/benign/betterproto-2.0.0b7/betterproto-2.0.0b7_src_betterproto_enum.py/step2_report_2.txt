  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described purpose, logic, and behavior with the actual code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Custom enum system with metaclasses and protections.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external interactions.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a complex but standard custom enum implementation.  \n- No signs of malicious activity, external data flow, or obfuscation.  \n- The securityRisk score of 0.5 seems high given the absence of any suspicious activity. A score of 0 or 0.1 would be more appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Lower securityRisk to 0 or 0.1, as no real risk is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Custom enum framework compatible with Python's enum.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no external data, standard patterns.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a sophisticated but legitimate enum system.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- The securityRisk of 0.2 is reasonable, given the complexity but lack of malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep the score as is; it aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Mimic enum.IntEnum with control, possibly for protobuf.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no external network or file access, complex but standard.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a complex but legitimate custom enum implementation.  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Security risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Custom Enum classes with metaclasses for enhanced behavior.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no external data flow, standard enum management.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a sophisticated but benign enum utility.  \n- No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores as assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Custom Enum classes for protobuf, with type safety.  \n- Analysis: No external data, no network or file I/O, input validation present.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-structured enum implementation.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identified no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are correct.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Most reports assigned 0.2 or 0.5, but given the code's nature—purely in-memory enum management with no external interactions—these should be closer to 0 or very near 0.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no external data flow, no network/file I/O, no backdoors)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, complex implementation of custom enum classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The existing scores overstate the security risk; they should be adjusted downward to reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Set malware score to 0.  \n- Set obfuscated score to 0.  \n- Set security risk score to 0.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's behavior.",
