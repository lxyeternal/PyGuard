{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to convert strings into different naming conventions such as snake_case, PascalCase, and camelCase, with sanitization to avoid Python keyword conflicts.",
  "sources": "None. The code only processes input strings passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "None. No untrusted data is read or processed from external sources.",
  "flows": "None. The functions operate on their input parameters without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code primarily performs string manipulation and keyword checking.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for string case conversions and sanitization, employing regex patterns for pattern matching. The functions include handling for Python keywords and identifier validity. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident in the implementation. The code's purpose appears to be straightforward string formatting utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for string case conversions and sanitization, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain any obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
