{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for converting strings into different naming conventions such as snake_case, PascalCase, and camelCase, with handling for Python keywords and symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads string input parameters provided to the functions `safe_snake_case`, `snake_case`, `pascal_case`, and `camel_case`.",
  "sinks": "The functions process and return transformed string data; no untrusted data outputs or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through transformation functions where they are modified by regex substitutions and string manipulations, but no data is sent externally or used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The regex patterns and string handling appear standard for string formatting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for string case conversions with attention to Python language keywords and identifier validity. It uses regex for pattern matching and substitution to perform transformations. The functions sanitize names by appending underscores to Python keywords and non-identifiers. No external network access, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident. The code appears solely focused on string formatting without any side effects or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for string case conversions with proper handling of Python keywords and identifiers. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code.",
