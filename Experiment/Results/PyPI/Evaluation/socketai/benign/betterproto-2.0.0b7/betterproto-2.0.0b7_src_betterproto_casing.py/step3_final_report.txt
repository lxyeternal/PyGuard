  "purpose": "Provides string case conversion functions (snake_case, PascalCase, camelCase) with sanitization for Python keywords and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Regex-based pattern matching for string transformations, keyword.iskeyword() check for sanitization.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or system interactions; all operations are internal string manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through regex substitutions and keyword checks; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward regex usage and sanitization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string case conversions with sanitization for Python keywords and invalid identifiers. It uses regex for pattern matching and substitution, which are safe in this context. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The sanitization functions correctly handle keywords and non-identifiers by appending underscores. The regex patterns are typical for such string transformations. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is clean, readable, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for string case conversion and sanitization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The minimal security risk score (0.1 in one report) is justified but can be considered negligible. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
