{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting strings into different case styles (snake_case, PascalCase, camelCase) with some sanitization for Python keywords and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the function parameters 'value', which are strings provided by the user or other parts of a program.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any output operations, network access, or file writing; it only processes and returns transformed strings.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through functions where they are matched against regex patterns, transformed by substitution functions, and sanitized before returning.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The code performs string transformations and sanitization without unusual or suspicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string case conversions and sanitization for Python identifiers, utilizing regex substitution and keyword checks. All operations are straightforward and serve to generate valid Python variable names or identifiers. No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code does not include any malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a harmless utility for string case conversions and sanitization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard and safe for use.",
