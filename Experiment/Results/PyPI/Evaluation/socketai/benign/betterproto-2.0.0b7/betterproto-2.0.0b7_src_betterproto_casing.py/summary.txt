  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for string case conversion and sanitization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The minimal security risk score (0.1 in one report) is justified but can be considered negligible. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
