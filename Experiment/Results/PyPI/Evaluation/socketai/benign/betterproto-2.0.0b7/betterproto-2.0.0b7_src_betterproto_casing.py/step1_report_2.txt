{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert strings into different naming conventions (snake_case, PascalCase, camelCase) with sanitization for Python keywords and invalid identifiers.",
  "sources": "Constants SYMBOLS, WORD, WORD_UPPER; input parameters to functions (value, strict); re.sub patterns; keyword.iskeyword check",
  "sinks": "re.sub replacements, keyword.iskeyword, string concatenation, return statements",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through regex substitutions and keyword checks; sanitized and returned as different case formats",
  "anomalies": "The code appears focused solely on string case conversions and sanitization; no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no hidden backdoors, no obfuscated code, and no external system interactions are present. It uses standard Python regex and string operations. No suspicious logic or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for converting strings into snake_case, PascalCase, and camelCase, handling edge cases such as Python keywords and invalid identifiers. It employs regex substitutions with clearly defined, benign purposes. The functions include sanitization steps and simple string manipulations. No external calls, no code injection, no suspicious data handling, or network operations are present. All code appears to be standard string formatting logic, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely for string formatting and sanitization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal use in code generation or naming standardization tasks.",
