{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting strings into various case formats (snake_case, PascalCase, camelCase) with sanitization for Python identifiers, primarily for code styling or naming purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the function parameters (strings) passed to functions such as safe_snake_case, snake_case, pascal_case, camel_case, and sanitize_name.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, file systems, or network. The functions produce transformed string outputs based on the input.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through the conversion functions, potentially being sanitized, transformed into different cases, or checked against Python keywords. There are no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes regex-based string manipulation, but all patterns and operations are standard for case conversion and sanitization. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for string case conversion (snake_case, PascalCase, camelCase) with options for strictness and sanitization to prevent invalid Python identifiers. The functions employ regex substitutions with straightforward logic, including keyword checks and identifier validation. The code appears to be a utility library for code style enforcement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. All operations are contained within string processing, with no external side-effects or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for naming conventions and sanitization, with no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It functions solely as a string transformation library for code or variable naming, adhering to standard practices.",
