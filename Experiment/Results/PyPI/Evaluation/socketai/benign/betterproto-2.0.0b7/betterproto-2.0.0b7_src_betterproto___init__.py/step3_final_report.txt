{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive protobuf serialization/deserialization library supporting JSON and stream encoding, with metadata management and optional performance modules.",
  "sources": "Input streams, JSON data, class attributes, external modules like 'betterproto_rust_codec'.",
  "sinks": "Serialized protobuf bytes, JSON strings, class attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes, JSON) flows through parsing functions into class fields; serialization functions convert class fields into bytes or JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected. External optional modules are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured protobuf handling library, implementing serialization, deserialization, JSON conversion, and stream processing. It uses common patterns such as metadata management, optional external modules for performance, and safe data handling. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. External dependencies are optional and benign. Data flows are typical for serialization libraries, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure protobuf serialization framework with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. It is safe for supply chain use under normal conditions.",
