{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom decorators for class and instance methods, specifically 'hybridmethod' and 'classproperty', to provide flexible method access patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior are present. The code employs advanced typing and decorator patterns but nothing inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party typing modules, then defines two generic classes, 'hybridmethod' and 'classproperty'. 'hybridmethod' provides a flexible decorator to create methods that can be accessed both at the class and instance levels, storing function references and retrieving them via '__get__'. 'classproperty' allows defining class-level properties. The code appears to serve as a utility for advanced method definitions, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The usage of advanced typing features is consistent with intended functionality, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code injection, or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility decorators for class and instance methods using advanced typing features. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation of custom method decorators for flexible method access patterns.",
