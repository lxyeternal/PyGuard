{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom decorators for hybrid methods and class properties, enabling methods to be called both at class and instance levels.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and instance context for method invocation; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output mechanisms are present; no untrusted data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code solely defines decorators and methods without data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code uses advanced typing features but nothing suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements advanced Python decorators for hybrid methods and class properties, utilizing typing and descriptor protocols. No external input sources or data sinks are identified. The code appears to serve as utility decorators for class design, with no indication of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or system harm. It employs standard Python features in a straightforward manner, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module defining decorators for hybrid methods and class properties. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible, and there are no signs of malicious intent.",
