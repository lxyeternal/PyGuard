{
  "purpose": "Defines decorators for hybrid methods and class properties using Python's descriptor protocol and advanced typing.",
  "sources": "Code reads class definitions, method functions, and type annotations; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; no network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Decorator functions and descriptor methods flow from class definitions to method calls, but no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements utility decorators (`hybridmethod` and `classproperty`) using standard Python features and typing. It does not perform any external communication, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The implementation appears correct, idiomatic, and free of malicious patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, risk=0 or 0.1, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for advanced Python decorators. No signs of supply chain security issues, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal security risk score (0 or 0.1) is justified given the code's static, structural nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
