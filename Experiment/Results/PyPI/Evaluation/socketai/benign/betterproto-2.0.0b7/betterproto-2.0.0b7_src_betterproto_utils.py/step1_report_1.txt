  "purpose": "Define custom decorators for hybrid methods and class properties in Python, enabling flexible method binding and property access.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and typing_extensions; class method definitions; function definitions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input handling, external data access, or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Code uses advanced typing features but no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes, 'hybridmethod' and 'classproperty', which implement custom method decorators. The 'hybridmethod' allows defining methods that can behave as class methods or instance methods depending on context, while 'classproperty' creates properties accessible at class level. Both classes use standard Python features, advanced typing, and do not execute any untrusted data or perform external actions. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be well-structured, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, well-structured implementation of custom decorators for class and instance methods. There are no malicious behaviors, no hidden backdoors, or security risks present.",
