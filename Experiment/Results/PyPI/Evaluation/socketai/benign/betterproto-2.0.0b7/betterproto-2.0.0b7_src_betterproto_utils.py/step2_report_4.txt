  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines custom decorators for hybrid methods and class properties.\n- Source/Sinks/Flows: No external data, no data leaks.\n- Anomalies: No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- Analysis: The code is straightforward, advanced typing, no external interactions.\n- Conclusion: Safe, well-structured, no security risks.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, custom decorators for hybrid/class properties.\n- Source/Sinks/Flows: No external data or external actions.\n- Anomalies: No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- Analysis: No external data handling, no dynamic code execution.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, security risks negligible.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (slightly above zero but justified as the code is purely structural)\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, justified by the absence of any malicious activity. The malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines decorators for hybrid and class properties.\n- Source/Sinks/Flows: No external input or data leaks.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Analysis: Utility decorators, no external data handling, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility decorators for class and instance methods.\n- Source/Sinks/Flows: No external data, no data leaks.\n- Anomalies: No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Standard Python features, no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign utility code.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Custom decorators for hybrid methods and class properties.\n- Source/Sinks/Flows: No external data or malicious behaviors.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Analysis: Utility decorators, no external interactions.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and uses standard patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, justified by the structural nature of the code and lack of external data handling.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- The code is a set of utility decorators for class and method behaviors, implemented with advanced typing but no malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The security risk is negligible, primarily structural.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with a very low but non-zero security risk due to the potential misuse of advanced decorators in a supply chain context, though no actual vulnerabilities are present)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe from a security perspective.",
