{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom decorators for hybrid methods and class properties, allowing flexible method binding and property access in Python classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, typing_extensions). No input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or sinks. The code mainly sets up class decorators and descriptors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code uses standard Python features for metaprogramming.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces custom class decorators: 'hybridmethod' for creating methods that can act as both class and instance methods, and 'classproperty' for defining class-level properties. These are implemented using Python's descriptor protocol and type annotations, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, input handling, or data leakage. The code relies solely on standard library features and typing extensions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of advanced Python decorators for method and property behavior customization. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code segment.",
