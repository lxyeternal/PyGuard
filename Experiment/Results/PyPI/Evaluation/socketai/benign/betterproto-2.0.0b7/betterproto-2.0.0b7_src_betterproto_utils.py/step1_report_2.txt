{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom decorator classes 'hybridmethod' and 'classproperty' to facilitate hybrid and class-level property behavior, respectively.",
  "sources": "Code reads class types, function attributes, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks for untrusted data; no I/O operations, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow paths indicating malicious intent are present; the code primarily sets up method decorators.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains advanced Python typing and decorator patterns, but no signs of obfuscated or malicious code such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom decorators for advanced class and method behaviors. It uses type annotations and typing_extensions for flexibility. No external data sources or sink points, no dynamic code execution, and no use of environment variables or I/O. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of decorator patterns to enhance class and method behaviors with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
