  "purpose": "A unit test stub for the TaskExtraLinks model in the airflow_client package, serving as a placeholder for future tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class definitions; no external data or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a standard autogenerated test scaffold with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, autogenerated unit test stub with no executable logic, data manipulation, or external interactions. It contains only import statements, class definitions, and placeholder methods. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as a safe, structural template with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is also 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, autogenerated test scaffold with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
