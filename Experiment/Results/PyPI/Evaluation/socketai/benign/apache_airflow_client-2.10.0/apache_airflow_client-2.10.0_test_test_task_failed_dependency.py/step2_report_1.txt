  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Describes a unit test stub for `TaskFailedDependency`.  \n- Sources: Imports modules, no external data.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: No data flow, just a placeholder.  \n- Anomalies: Contains only a placeholder with no logic, no malicious code.  \n- Analysis: Standard boilerplate, no external interactions, no suspicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware score: 0\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, a test stub for `TaskFailedDependency`.  \n- Sources: Same imports, no external data.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: No data flow.  \n- Anomalies: Placeholder only, no anomalies.  \n- Analysis: Standard boilerplate, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, no security concerns.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware score: 0\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, a test stub.  \n- Sources: Same imports, no external data.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: No data flow.  \n- Anomalies: Placeholder only.  \n- Analysis: Typical auto-generated test scaffold, no malicious code.  \n- Conclusion: No security issues.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware score: 0\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same, a test stub.  \n- Sources: Same modules, no external data.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: No data flow.  \n- Anomalies: Placeholder only.  \n- Analysis: Standard boilerplate, no malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware score: 0\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same, a test stub.  \n- Sources: Same modules, no external data.  \n- Sinks: None.  \n- Flows: No data flow.  \n- Anomalies: Placeholder only.  \n- Analysis: Typical auto-generated code, no malicious intent.  \n- Conclusion: No security concerns.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware score: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe a minimal, boilerplate unit test stub with no operational logic, no data processing, no network activity, and no external inputs or outputs.  \n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; all reports confirm the absence of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Security risk:** Effectively zero, as these are just structural test scaffolds with no active logic.\n\n### Final scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior identified)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding techniques present)  \n- **Risk:** Given the absence of any active or potentially harmful logic, the overall security risk is negligible. I would assign a score of **0** here.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis code is a benign, auto-generated unit test scaffold with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The scores should reflect this:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final recommendation:** The report accurately describes a safe, standard boilerplate code with no security concerns.",
