{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal, auto-generated unit test scaffold for the TaskFailedDependency model, containing no active logic, data processing, or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external outputs, or network communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic execution; placeholder test method with no active code.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only placeholder comments with no implementation or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward boilerplate test class with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any security-sensitive code. The structure is typical of auto-generated test scaffolds, with no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard placeholder for unit testing, and the scores should reflect its safe, inert nature.",
