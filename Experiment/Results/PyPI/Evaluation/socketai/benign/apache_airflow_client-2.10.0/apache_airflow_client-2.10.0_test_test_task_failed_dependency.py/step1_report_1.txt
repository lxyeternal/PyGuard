  "purpose": "Unit testing stub for the TaskFailedDependency model in the airflow_client package.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, unittest, airflow_client.client, and airflow_client.client.model.task_failed_dependency; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no processing of untrusted data or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up a test class with placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a placeholder test method with no implementation, no actual test logic, and a commented-out instantiation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for unit testing, defines a test class for TaskFailedDependency, and contains empty setup and teardown methods. The test method is a placeholder with a commented instruction to construct the object but currently does nothing. There are no external inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a standard boilerplate for future unit tests. No suspicious or malicious elements identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test stub template for a specific model class, with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks present.",
