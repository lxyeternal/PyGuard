{
  "purpose": "The code defines a unit test stub for the TaskFailedDependency model in the airflow_client package, intended for testing the behavior of this data model class.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules (sys, unittest, airflow_client.client, airflow_client.client.model.task_failed_dependency), and the class methods (setUp, tearDown, testTaskFailedDependency).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow paths from untrusted sources that could lead to vulnerabilities; the code does not process external inputs or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the test stub does not execute any logic beyond setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate test class structure with commented-out construction of the model object, with no actual data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python unittest structure intended as a placeholder for future test implementations. It imports modules, defines a test class with setup and teardown methods, and a test method that is currently empty. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues. The code does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or sensitive operations. Its purpose appears solely to facilitate testing of a data model class.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, boilerplate unit test stub with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any harmful actions. Overall, it is a standard testing scaffold with no security concerns.",
