{
  "purpose": "A utility class ResultIterable designed to wrap a SizedIterable for use in Spark, enabling pickling of result data that cannot be pickled by default iterators.",
  "sources": "The data source is the SizedIterable passed during initialization, which is used in __init__ and __iter__ methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or output data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the SizedIterable source into the class, and __iter__ returns an iterator over this data; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple wrapper class for a SizedIterable, providing iteration and length functionalities to facilitate pickling in Spark. It uses standard Python constructs, with no network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic. The class stores the data, computes its length, and provides iteration, fulfilling its utility purpose. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence (1). The code's purpose is solely to support distributed data processing, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility class with no malicious intent or security risks. All evidence points to a safe implementation suitable for its intended use in Spark environments.",
