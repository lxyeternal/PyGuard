{
  "purpose": "Define a specialized iterable class for handling non-picklable results in a Spark environment",
  "sources": "Input data provided during class instantiation, specifically the 'data' parameter in __init__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code does not write or transmit data",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'data' parameter into the class and is accessed via __iter__ and __len__ methods",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class ResultIterable that wraps around a 'SizedIterable' to enable pickling of results that normally cannot be pickled. It stores the input data and provides iteration and length functionalities. The import statements and class methods are standard and do not perform any network or system modifications. No untrusted data sources, sinks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a purely functional purpose within a larger Spark context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility class for handling result data in Spark. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
