{
  "purpose": "Define a specialized iterable class for handling data that cannot be pickled, primarily for use with Spark results.",
  "sources": "The 'data' parameter passed to the constructor (__init__) which is a 'SizedIterable[T]'.",
  "sinks": "The class provides no sinks for untrusted data; it simply encapsulates data for iteration.",
  "flows": "Data is passed into the ResultIterable instance, stored internally, and then accessed via __iter__().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, uses standard typing, and includes licensing comments only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured Python class designed to wrap around a sized iterable. It provides iteration and length functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. It does not perform network operations, handle secrets, or execute dynamic code. The import statements and comments suggest standard usage within Apache Spark context. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class intended for handling Spark result data. There is no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in this implementation.",
