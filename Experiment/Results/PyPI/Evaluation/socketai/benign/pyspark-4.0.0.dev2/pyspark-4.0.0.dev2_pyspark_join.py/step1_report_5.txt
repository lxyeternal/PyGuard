  "purpose": "Implementations of various join and cogroup operations for RDDs in PySpark.",
  "sources": "Input RDDs provided as function arguments (rdd, other, rdds).",
  "sinks": "Data returned from join functions; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input RDDs -> Processing in join functions -> Output RDDs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual or misleading variable names, no obfuscated code, no network or system modification behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several standard Spark join operations (_do_python_join, python_join, python_right_outer_join, python_left_outer_join, python_full_outer_join, python_cogroup). It uses mapValues, union, groupByKey, flatMapValues, and mapValues with dispatch functions to produce Cartesian product joins or grouped results. There are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets, no network calls, and no external resource access are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Spark join operations, utilizing standard patterns and library functions without obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of PySpark join and cogroup functions. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is low, with no malicious intent detected.",
