{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for performing various types of joins and cogroup operations on PySpark RDDs, facilitating data combination tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from RDDs via mapValues, union, groupByKey, and reduce operations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are RDDs resulting from join and cogroup transformations; no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input RDDs through mapValues and union into groupByKey, then through dispatch functions to produce joined results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard PySpark join utilities with clear, straightforward logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external data leaks. The functions perform typical data processing tasks without network activity or system modifications. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, benign PySpark RDD join functions with no malicious or suspicious features. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign utility purpose.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
