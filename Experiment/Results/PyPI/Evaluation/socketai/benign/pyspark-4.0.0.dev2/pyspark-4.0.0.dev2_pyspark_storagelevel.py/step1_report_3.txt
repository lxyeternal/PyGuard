  "purpose": "Define and manage storage level configurations for an RDD in a distributed computing framework, providing constants for common configurations.",
  "sources": "Class initialization (__init__), class variable assignments (StorageLevel.*), and string representation methods (__repr__, __str__).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink locations that handle untrusted data; methods do not process external input or output data untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Initialization of StorageLevel instances with parameters, and usage of class constants which are predefined instances; no dynamic or external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The constants are straightforward predefined configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a StorageLevel class for managing RDD storage configurations, including various static constants for common storage strategies. It uses type annotations, class variables, and standard string representations. No input validation, external data handling, or network activity is present. The class constructor sets configuration flags and replication factor, and the static constants are instantiated with fixed parameters. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration class with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for managing storage options in a distributed system context. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is purely for internal configuration purposes.",
