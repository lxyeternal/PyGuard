{
  "purpose": "Define a class for managing storage level configurations in an RDD system, with preset constants for common configurations.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__), static constants assignments, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not send data to external systems or perform data leakage.",
  "flows": "The class constructor initializes internal state; the static constants instantiate predefined configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard for a configuration class. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a StorageLevel class with multiple class variables representing different storage configurations. The constructor sets internal attributes based on parameters. Constants are instantiated with specific parameters. The code is purely for configuration management, with no input/output or external network interaction. The implementation is straightforward, with no unusual language features, dynamic code execution, or misleading constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for storage levels in an RDD context, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply defines data structures and constants without any external interaction or sensitive data handling.",
