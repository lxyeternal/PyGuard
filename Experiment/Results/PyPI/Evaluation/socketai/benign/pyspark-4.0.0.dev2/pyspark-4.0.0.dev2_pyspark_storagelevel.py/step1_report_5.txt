{
  "purpose": "Define a class for representing various storage levels and their configurations for controlling data storage in an RDD framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code defines constants and a class with configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code is purely defining data structures and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the class instances are used for configuration purposes within the system.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious logic. The class design appears standard for a configuration object.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a StorageLevel class with several class variables representing different storage configurations, initialized with specific parameters. The class includes methods for representation, string conversion, and equality comparison. It is part of a larger framework (likely Spark or similar) and only contains configuration data. No external input, user data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. No malicious or malicious-sounding code detected. The code appears to be standard, well-documented, and intended for defining storage behavior settings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a configuration class for storage levels, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines constants and data structures used for internal system configuration.",
