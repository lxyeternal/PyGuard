{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing storage level configurations with static constants for common setups, used in data processing frameworks like Spark.",
  "sources": "Class constructor parameters, static constant initializations",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input/output or network activity",
  "flows": "Instantiation of static constants, comparison methods, string representations",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward configuration class with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, standard class defining storage configurations with static constants. It contains no external input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The implementation is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static constants are fixed configurations, and methods are typical for such classes. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration class for storage levels, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.",
