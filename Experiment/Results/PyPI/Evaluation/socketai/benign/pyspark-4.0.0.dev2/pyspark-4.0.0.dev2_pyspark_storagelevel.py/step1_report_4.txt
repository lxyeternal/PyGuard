{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for controlling storage levels of RDDs in a data processing framework, with static constants for common configurations.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__), class variable initializations, and magic methods (__repr__, __str__, __eq__).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of StorageLevel instances -> use of predefined static constants -> comparison and representation methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or obfuscated code. The static constants are straightforward predefined configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with attributes controlling data storage behaviors for a data processing system. It includes static constants representing common storage configurations. The class methods provide standard object behaviors such as string representation and equality checks. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of configuration objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for storage levels, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a straightforward data container with predefined settings. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
