  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Spark worker responsible for executing user code with dynamic deserialization and execution points. While no active malicious activity or payloads are evident, the use of deserialization and eval/exec poses inherent security risks if inputs are untrusted. The overall malware score should be low but non-zero, reflecting the potential for arbitrary code execution through malicious serialized data."
