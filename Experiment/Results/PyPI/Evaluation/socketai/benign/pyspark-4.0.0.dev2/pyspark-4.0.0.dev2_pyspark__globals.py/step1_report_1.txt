{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton class for a special keyword value and prevent module reloading to maintain class identity.",
  "sources": "Module import and execution; global namespace; class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code mainly sets up a singleton class and a reloading guard.",
  "flows": "Import/initiation → singleton class creation → global reload check.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a singleton class '_NoValueType' with a global instance '_NoValue'. It also prevents reloading of this module by raising a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to reload it, which ensures consistency of the class identity. The class implementation follows standard singleton pattern, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. The initial check using '_is_loaded' prevents module reloading, which is a common pattern for preserving singleton state. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of singleton pattern and module reloading guard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a singleton class and a reload guard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
