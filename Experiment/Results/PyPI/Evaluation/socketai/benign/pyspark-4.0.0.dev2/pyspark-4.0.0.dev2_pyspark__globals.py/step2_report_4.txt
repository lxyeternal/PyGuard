  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a singleton class (_NoValueType) used as a sentinel value, with a guard against module reloading to preserve singleton identity.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscated segments.\n- The reloading guard raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to reload the module, which is a known pattern to maintain singleton integrity.\n- The singleton pattern is implemented via __new__, with support for pickling (__reduce__) and a custom __repr__.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected; the code appears to serve a utility purpose within a larger system.\n\n**Issue Presence:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The reported issues are primarily about the design pattern and reloading guard, which are legitimate practices.\n\n**Score Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or lower in all reports. The only potential concern is the deliberate raising of an exception on reload, which could be inconvenient but not risky or malicious.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- No report suggests that the code could be exploited or used maliciously; thus, increasing the risk score would be unwarranted.\n\n**Overall Synthesis:**\n- The code is a benign utility module implementing singleton pattern and reload prevention.\n- No issues are present that would indicate security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The approach is standard and well-understood in Python singleton and module management patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Malware**   | 0                 | No malicious activity detected. |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0                 | Code is clear and straightforward. |\n| **Risk**       | 0.1               | Minimal risk due to reload guard; generally safe. No security concerns. |\n\n**Note:** The small non-zero risk score (e.g., 0.1) can be justified by the fact that raising exceptions on reload could cause runtime issues if reloading is expected in some workflows, but it does not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Remarks:\nThe code is a standard, benign singleton implementation with a reload guard. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware Score: 0  \n- Obfuscated Score: 0  \n- Risk Score: 0.1 (or 0.0 if you prefer absolute safety)  \n\nThis assessment confirms the code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
