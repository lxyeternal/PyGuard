{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton class for a special keyword value and prevents reloading of the module to preserve class identity.",
  "sources": "The module itself, specifically the import and class instantiation sections.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily manages class instantiation and module reloading behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. The module raises an exception if reloaded, which is a deliberate design choice but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a singleton pattern for the _NoValueType class, ensuring only one instance exists. It raises a RuntimeError if the module is reloaded to prevent identity changes, which is a safeguard mechanism. The class includes methods for singleton preservation and representation. The logic is straightforward and does not perform any data manipulation, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard singleton implementation with a module reload guard. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code.",
