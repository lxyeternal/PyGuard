{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton class for a special sentinel value (_NoValue) used as a default argument in functions, and prevent reloading of the module to maintain class identity.",
  "sources": "The module reads no external input or untrusted data; it defines classes and module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only creates singleton instances and enforces module load restrictions.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable behavior is preventing module reloading via a global flag and raising a RuntimeError, which is a standard pattern to preserve class identity; no malicious or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class _NoValueType for a special sentinel value, ensuring only one instance exists. It includes mechanisms for pickling (via __reduce__) and string representation (__repr__). The module raises an error if reloaded, using a global flag _is_loaded. All behaviors are standard and aimed at maintaining singleton identity and module integrity. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code's structure and logic are typical for singleton pattern enforcement and module load control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a singleton sentinel value with a module reload prevention mechanism. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code appears to serve a utility purpose without security concerns.",
