{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton class _NoValueType used as a sentinel value, with a module reload guard to prevent reinitialization, ensuring singleton identity remains consistent across reloads.",
  "sources": "The module reads no external input; it defines classes and global variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data flows or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The explicit RuntimeError on reload is unusual but is a deliberate design choice to maintain singleton integrity; no malicious or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern via __new__, with a global guard against reloading by raising RuntimeError if '_is_loaded' exists in globals(). It defines a singleton instance _NoValue of class _NoValueType, which supports pickling and custom representation. The pattern is standard, with no external dependencies or malicious code. The reload guard prevents reinitialization, which could cause runtime issues but is not malicious. No obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code serves as a utility to maintain singleton identity across module reloads, with no security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module implementing singleton pattern and reload prevention. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
