{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton class _NoValueType and prevent reloading of the module to preserve class identity, as part of a larger system (pyspark).",
  "sources": "Module import and execution, specifically the import of this script which sets __ALL__, and the check for '_is_loaded' in globals.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, output, or system interaction that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Import and execution of module code, setting __ALL__, checking and setting _is_loaded, and singleton creation via __new__ in _NoValueType.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The module strictly enforces singleton pattern and prevents reloading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class _NoValueType with controlled instantiation to ensure only one instance exists. It also sets a guard against reloading the module by raising RuntimeError if '_is_loaded' is detected in globals, which is a legitimate technique to preserve class identity. The class includes __reduce__ to support pickling, and a __repr__ method for representation. No data input/output, network activity, or other suspicious operations are present. The code appears to serve a purely structural purpose within a larger system, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility to enforce singleton pattern and prevent reloading, with no indications of malicious or suspicious activity. It appears safe and consistent with its intended purpose.",
