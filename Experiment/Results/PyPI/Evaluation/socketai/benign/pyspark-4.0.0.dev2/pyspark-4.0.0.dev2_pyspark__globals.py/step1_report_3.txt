{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton class _NoValue for use as a default keyword argument, and prevent module reloading to preserve class identity.",
  "sources": "The module reads no external input or data; it defines classes and module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is primarily class and module management.",
  "anomalies": "The module raises an error if reloaded, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are present. The singleton pattern implementation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code prevents reloading to maintain singleton identities, a common practice in some Python modules. The class _NoValueType enforces singleton behavior through __new__, and supports pickling via __reduce__. No external inputs, network operations, or hidden behaviors are present. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured singleton implementation with reload protection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard singleton class implementation combined with reload prevention. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
