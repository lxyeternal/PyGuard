  "purpose": "Configuration management for a Spark application, setting various parameters via key-value pairs.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, JVM objects, internal properties, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Internal storage structures, JVM configuration objects, debug string output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and JVM interactions to internal storage and debug output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard SparkConf class for managing Spark configurations. It interacts with JVM objects when available and uses internal dictionaries otherwise. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code's structure is clear, and its purpose is benign. The interactions with JVM objects are typical for PySpark and do not introduce security concerns. No external data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-documented and follows best practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Spark configuration class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, primarily reflecting the minimal risks associated with configuration management and JVM interactions. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments.",
