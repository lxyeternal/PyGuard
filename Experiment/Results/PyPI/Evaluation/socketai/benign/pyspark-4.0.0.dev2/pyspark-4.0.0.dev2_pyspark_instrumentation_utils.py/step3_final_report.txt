{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to wrap methods and properties in modules and classes, adding logging for success, failure, and missing attribute events, primarily for instrumentation, debugging, or monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reflection via inspect and importlib to access functions, properties, and class members; external logger module for logging events.",
  "sinks": "Logger methods such as log_success, log_failure, and log_missing; no direct data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Wrapped functions and properties invoke logger methods during execution; source (original function/property) to sink (logger call).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard reflection and dynamic wrapping are used for instrumentation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign instrumentation utility that dynamically wraps functions and properties to add logging. It uses reflection to identify functions, properties, static methods, and missing attributes, wrapping them with additional logging behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The reflection and dynamic wrapping could be misused if malicious modules are injected, but the code itself is standard for debugging or monitoring purposes. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, transparent instrumentation utility for logging method and property calls. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The low security risk score is justified, and the code can be considered safe in isolation.",
