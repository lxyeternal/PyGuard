{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions to wrap functions and properties within modules and classes for logging purposes, primarily to monitor success and failure of method calls.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as functools, inspect, threading, importlib, and time; accesses module attributes and functions; reads class and method definitions; accesses threading local storage.",
  "sinks": "Calls to logger methods (log_success, log_failure, log_missing); wraps functions and properties which could potentially be exploited if logger or function inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Wraps functions and properties during module and class inspection, with flow from inspection to wrapping, then to calling wrapped functions that invoke logging methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses threading local storage and dynamic wrapping but these are common in logging frameworks. No obfuscated or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically wraps functions and properties for logging purposes, including special functions and missing method handling. It dynamically imports loggers, applies decorators, and manages threading state. No suspicious data handling or malicious behavior is evident. The code is designed for monitoring, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for method and property wrapping to facilitate logging within modules and classes. No malicious or sabotage behavior is detected. It does not perform any harmful actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or reverse shells.",
