  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of a version comparison utility, originating from the CPython source.\n- It uses regex to split version strings into components, converts numeric parts to integers, and provides comparison operators.\n- No external network activity, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- All reports consistently describe the code as benign, straightforward, and aligned with standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues or malicious behavior are present.** The code is a benign utility for version comparison.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified.** The code appears correct and well-structured.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are 0, reflecting no risk.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, which is justified since the code performs no malicious actions.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior based on assumptions; all assessments are consistent with the code's function.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a standard, well-understood utility from the Python standard library, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, benign, and intended solely for version string parsing and comparison. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
