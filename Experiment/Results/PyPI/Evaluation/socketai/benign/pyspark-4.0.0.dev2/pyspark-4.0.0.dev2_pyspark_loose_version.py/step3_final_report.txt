  "purpose": "A utility class for parsing and comparing version strings, derived from the CPython source code.",
  "sources": "Input version string passed to the constructor or parse method.",
  "sinks": "Comparison operators (_cmp method) comparing internal version components.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex split into components -> convert numeric parts to int -> store in self.version -> comparison operations use self.version for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a version comparison utility, using regex to split version strings into components, converting numeric parts to integers, and providing comparison operators based on internal list comparison. It originates from the standard Python cpython source, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code performs internal parsing and comparison without external interactions or data leaks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as is the obfuscated score and security risk score. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate version string comparisons, and no anomalies or malicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version comparison utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
