  "purpose": "Assign a version string '5.0.0' to a variable, serving as a version declaration in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '5.0.0' to the variable 'version'. No external data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the assignment is static and does not involve any source-to-sink data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to a variable. It involves no inputs, outputs, or control flow. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code is typical for version declaration in software projects and poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and safety. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
