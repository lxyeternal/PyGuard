{
  "purpose": "The code provides syntax rules, autocompletion functions, and metadata accessors for Cassandra CQL, primarily supporting parsing, suggestions, and schema introspection within tooling.",
  "sources": "User input contexts, database metadata retrieval functions (e.g., get_keyspace_names, get_table_meta, get_usertype_names), fixed command strings like 'LIST USERS' and 'LIST ROLES'.",
  "sinks": "Suggestion generation functions, metadata queries, and static command executions; no untrusted code execution or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input or context into suggestion functions; metadata retrieval functions query Cassandra schema info; suggestions are generated based on sanitized inputs and schema data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Functions employ standard escaping and quoting methods; no network activity or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured set of syntax rules and completion functions for Cassandra CQL, relying on safe metadata access and string escaping. It performs read-only operations and suggestion generation, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of static commands like 'LIST USERS' and 'LIST ROLES' could potentially leak sensitive info if misused, but this is typical for management tooling. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Cassandra schema parser and autocompletion utility. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from potential information disclosure via metadata queries, which is standard for such tools. The assigned scores are justified and align with the detailed analysis.",
