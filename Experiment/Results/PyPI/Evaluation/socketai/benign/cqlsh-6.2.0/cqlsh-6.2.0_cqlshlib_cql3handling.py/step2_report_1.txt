  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code functionality, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of syntax rules, autocompletion functions, and metadata accessors for Cassandra CQL. It primarily provides parsing, suggestions, and schema introspection.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are detected. Functions are standard for tooling support.\n- **Security implications:** The code is read-only, relying on trusted database metadata and standard escaping functions.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score = 0 is appropriate; obfuscated = 0; security risk = 0.1 is reasonable considering the potential for injection if misused elsewhere, but within this code, it appears safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with a legitimate utility component.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on schema and metadata retrieval for autocompletion. It mentions potential risks if untrusted data influences suggestions or if the database responses are maliciously manipulated.\n- **Assessment:** The code interacts with the database to retrieve user/role info, which could be sensitive if misused, but no malicious code is present.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0 is correct; security risk = 0.1 is acceptable, acknowledging minimal exposure.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on parsing and suggestion generation with standard escaping and quoting functions. No network or malicious code detected.\n- **Assessment:** The functions are typical for such tooling; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0; obfuscated = 0; security risk = 0.1 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate schema and query parser, no malicious signs.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe metadata queries and suggestion logic.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; standard metadata retrieval and suggestion functions.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0; obfuscated = 0; security risk = 0.2 is slightly higher but still acceptable, considering the potential for injection if external input is mishandled elsewhere.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, scores appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—schema parsing, autocompletion, and metadata access with standard practices.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code or obfuscation; safe and typical for tooling.\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0; obfuscated = 0; security risk = 0.1 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code with no signs of sabotage.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clarity and structure of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) due to the potential for injection if external inputs are misused, but within acceptable bounds given the context. No significant security risks are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — justified.\n- **Risk score:** Given the analysis, a uniform risk score of **0.1** is appropriate for all, reflecting minimal but non-zero potential if misused.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\n**All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed analysis.** No modifications are necessary.",
