{
  "purpose": "This code provides syntax parsing, auto-completion, and metadata retrieval for Cassandra CQL queries and schema management, likely part of a tool or CLI for Cassandra.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from user-provided CQL queries and commands, and from Cassandra metadata and session queries (e.g., get_keyspace_names, execute LIST USERS/ROLES).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string formatting for prompts and hints, and Cassandra session executions that retrieve user/role lists and trigger names.",
  "flows": "User input → parsing/validation → data retrieval from Cassandra metadata/session → string formatting for auto-completion and hints.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network actions are present. The code uses standard parsing and Cassandra interaction methods. No data leakage or security-critical operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a comprehensive parser and autocompletion framework for Cassandra CQL commands. It retrieves schema and session information securely via Cassandra's API. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden network activity. The session queries for listing users and roles are typical administrative operations. All operations seem confined to Cassandra metadata and do not involve external or suspicious network connections. The code structure and usage follow standard practices, with no suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, schema-related parsing and autocompletion utility for Cassandra CQL, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs schema introspection and command parsing in a controlled manner, with no indication of malicious intent.",
