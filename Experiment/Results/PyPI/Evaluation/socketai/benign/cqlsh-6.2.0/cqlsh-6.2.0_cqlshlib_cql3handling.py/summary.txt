  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Cassandra schema parser and autocompletion utility. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from potential information disclosure via metadata queries, which is standard for such tools. The assigned scores are justified and align with the detailed analysis."
