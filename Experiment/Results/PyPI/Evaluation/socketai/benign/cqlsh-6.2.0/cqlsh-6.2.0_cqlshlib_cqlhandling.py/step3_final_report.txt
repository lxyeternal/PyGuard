{
  "purpose": "The code implements a parser and autocompletion utility for Cassandra Query Language (CQL), focusing on syntax analysis, token handling, and keyword management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text for parsing, tokenization, and completion suggestions; it accesses external modules for lexing, parsing, and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; the code does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input text is tokenized, processed through parsing and completion functions, with no data flowing into external systems or executing malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious patterns; use of 'traceback' is standard for debugging, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward parser and autocompletion utility for CQL, relying on external libraries for lexing and parsing. It manages reserved keywords, token processing, and syntax matching. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration are present. The use of 'traceback' for exception printing is typical during development. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the nature of the code as a syntax utility, with no network or data leakage functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a standard CQL parser and autocompletion helper. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
