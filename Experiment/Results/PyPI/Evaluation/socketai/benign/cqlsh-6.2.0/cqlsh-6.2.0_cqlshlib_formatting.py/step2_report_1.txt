  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is for formatting Cassandra data types, with input via function parameters and environment variables. No external data sources like network or files outside parameters are read.\n- **Sinks:** String formatting, regex substitutions, and display functions. No external system interactions.\n- **Flows:** Data flows into functions, transformed, and output as formatted strings. Environment variables influence formatting but don't introduce untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a standard, well-structured formatting utility. It handles various data types, uses regex for control characters, and environment variables for configuration. No malicious or malicious-looking logic is present.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks, malware, or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on formatting with input from parameters and environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** String outputs, with colorization. No external system interaction.\n- **Flows:** Data processed through formatters, no external commands or data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Uses regex for control characters, standard libraries, and environment variables for configuration. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard formatting code with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero) — justified as minimal configuration-based risk, but overall very low.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Formatting for Cassandra data types, with environment variables and input parameters.\n- **Sinks:** String outputs, no external system interaction.\n- **Flows:** Data flows into formatting functions, no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Focused on safe string formatting, regex for control characters, environment variables for configuration. No malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate formatting utilities.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (appropriate for configuration risk)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Formatting functions for Cassandra types, environment variables, and input data.\n- **Sinks:** String outputs, no external system calls.\n- **Flows:** Data processed into display strings, no external data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Focused on data display, regex for control characters, environment variables for configuration. No malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate formatting code, safe for use.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (justified as minimal configuration-based risk)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on data formatting, with input data and environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** String outputs for display, no external system interaction.\n- **Flows:** Data flows into formatting functions, no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Uses regex, standard libraries, environment variables. No malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard formatting utility.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to configuration via environment variables, but overall very low.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, the code appears to be a standard, safe formatting library for Cassandra data types. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden logic)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 to 0.1 (very low, primarily due to configuration options, but no real security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for data formatting and display purposes only.",
