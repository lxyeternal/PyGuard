{
  "purpose": "Formatting Cassandra data types for display and serialization, including handling control characters, colors, and various data formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, environment variables for configuration (e.g., timestamp formats). No external data sources or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "String outputs, regex substitutions, formatted display values. No external system calls or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows through formatting functions, regex processing, and output formatting; environment variables influence formatting but do not introduce untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Regex for control characters and environment variable usage are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive data formatting utility for Cassandra types, with functions for parsing, formatting, and display. It uses regex for control character handling, environment variables for configuration, and standard libraries. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or external system interactions are present. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and appears to serve purely for data presentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate formatting utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is well-structured, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The environment variable usage is standard for configuration purposes. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
