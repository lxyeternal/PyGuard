{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions and classes for formatting and coloring terminal output, primarily for displaying string values with optional color coding and alignment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it operates solely on input parameters provided to functions or class constructors.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, network, or external systems; it only processes and returns formatted strings.",
  "flows": "Input values are processed by functions like colorme() and class methods, which generate formatted or colored string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code relies on standard string and formatting operations without obfuscated or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for color codes and a class for formatted string values with methods for padding and alignment. Functions handle the coloring and formatting of strings based on provided color mappings. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The code serves purely as a formatting utility for display purposes, with no apparent malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for formatting and coloring terminal output. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and appears to be standard formatting code.",
