{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for color-formatted string display, including color styling for different data types and formatting functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it defines constants and classes for formatting output.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; all data is static or derived from internal formatting.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the functions operate on internal data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected. The code primarily handles string formatting and color coding for terminal display.",
  "analysis": "The code defines color codes, formatting functions, and classes for stylized terminal output. It uses constants for ANSI escape sequences and provides methods to pad, justify, and colorize strings based on their data type. There is no dynamic code execution, external data reading, or malicious behavior evident. The code appears to be purely presentational, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for terminal text formatting with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as expected for its purpose without handling or transmitting sensitive data.",
