{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for colored terminal output formatting, including handling of color codes and string alignment.",
  "sources": "Constants defining color escape sequences, input parameters for formatting functions and class constructors, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily outputs formatted strings with optional color codes, which are returned or printed elsewhere; no direct output or data sinks are present within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (strings, color maps) flow into functions and class constructors, resulting in formatted string objects or colored string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; the code uses standard methods for string formatting and color handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines color constants, a utility function 'colorme' for applying color formatting, and a 'FormattedValue' class for managing string display and coloring with consideration for terminal display widths. It includes mechanisms to handle color maps and default color schemes, but all logic pertains solely to string formatting for display purposes. No input/output operations or network activity are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of terminal string coloring utilities, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely intended for terminal string formatting with color support. There is no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risk detected. It functions as a utility for display formatting without side effects.",
