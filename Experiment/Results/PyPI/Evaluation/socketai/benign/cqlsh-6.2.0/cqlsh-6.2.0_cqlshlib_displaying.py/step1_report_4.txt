{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for color formatting and display of string values in terminal output, including support for colored text and padding.",
  "sources": "The code reads color settings, string values, and formatting parameters from internal variables, class instances, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly send data to external systems, network, or files; it primarily formats output for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (strings, color mappings) through formatting functions and class methods, resulting in styled string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns observed. Usage of color escape sequences and string formatting appears standard and for visual output purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles terminal color formatting, padding, and string representation through classes and functions. No input from external sources such as environment variables, network, or files is processed. No dynamic code execution, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions perform straightforward string manipulations and formatting, with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for terminal text styling and formatting. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger display or logging utility. The overall security risk is negligible.",
