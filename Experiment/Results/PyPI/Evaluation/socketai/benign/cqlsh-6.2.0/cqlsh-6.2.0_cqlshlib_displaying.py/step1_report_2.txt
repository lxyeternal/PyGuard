{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for colorizing and formatting string values, primarily for display purposes, with no apparent functional logic related to data processing or external interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the constructor of the FormattedValue class, which takes string values and optional display parameters.",
  "sinks": "The formatted string outputs, including color codes, are generated and returned but do not directly lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to FormattedValue objects; methods like ljust, rjust, color_ljust, and color_rjust process these inputs and produce formatted string outputs with color codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No external network connections or file operations are included. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for color codes and classes for formatting and displaying string values with color attributes. The functions and classes serve purely for formatting and display, with no data input validation, external data handling, or side effects. There are no code injection points, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is well-structured for formatting purposes only, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module focused on string formatting and colored output for display, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a way that would lead to vulnerabilities or leaks.",
