  "purpose": "Generate SSL settings for Cassandra based on configuration files and environment variables, including validation and protocol negotiation.",
  "sources": "Configuration file sections [ssl], [certfiles], environment variables SSL_CERTFILE, SSL_VALIDATE, SSL_VERSION, and user paths expanded from certfile and keyfile options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Reads config options -> determines validation and certfile paths -> expands paths -> constructs SSL context parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard validation and error handling with sys.exit(). Warning about ignored SSL versions is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code reads SSL configuration from files and environment variables, performs validation checks, expands user paths, and sets SSL parameters accordingly. It uses sys.exit() for critical errors, which is typical for CLI tools. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with best practices for SSL setup. The warning about ignored SSL versions is benign. Overall, the code is a standard SSL configuration utility with minimal security risk and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SSL configuration utility with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports are accurate and justified.",
