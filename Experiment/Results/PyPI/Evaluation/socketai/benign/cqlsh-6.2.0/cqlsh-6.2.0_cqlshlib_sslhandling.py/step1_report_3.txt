  "purpose": "Generate SSL settings for Cassandra cluster connections based on configuration files and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (configparser.read), environment variables (env parameter), function parameters (host, config_file).",
  "sinks": "sys.exit call when validation is enabled but no certfile is provided, potential for abrupt termination if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Reads config and environment variables -> Validates presence of certfile -> Returns dictionary with SSL configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.exit for error handling, which could cause abrupt termination; no evident malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads SSL configuration from files and environment variables, applies standard validation and protocol selection. Uses sys.exit for error conditions, which is typical for CLI tools but not inherently malicious. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. It performs standard SSL configuration handling without insecure practices or hardcoded credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration utility for SSL settings with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected operations securely, without secret exfiltration or malicious network activity. No security risks are apparent beyond typical configuration handling issues.",
