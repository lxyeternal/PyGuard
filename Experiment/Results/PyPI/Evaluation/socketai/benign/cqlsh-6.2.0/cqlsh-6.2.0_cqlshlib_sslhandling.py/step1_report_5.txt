  "purpose": "Generate SSL settings for Cassandra cluster connections based on configuration files and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Configuration file read via configparser, environment variables (SSL_VALIDATE, SSL_VERSION, SSL_CERTFILE), and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The returned dictionary may be used to configure SSL connections, particularly for certfile, keyfile, and SSL protocol version.",
  "flows": "Environment variables override config file options; config file options influence the returned SSL settings; certfile and keyfile paths are expanded.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a print warning about ignoring explicit SSL versions, but no malicious or suspicious anomalies are present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from a file and environment variables to set up SSL parameters. It performs standard validation and fallback mechanisms for SSL cert files and validation settings. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, or suspicious logic observed. The use of sys.exit for missing certfile when validation is enabled is standard for critical configuration errors. The code relies on secure SSL library constants and practices.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a typical configuration utility for SSL settings in a database client, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain security risks. It handles configuration data carefully, with proper fallback and validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
