  "purpose": "To define the package metadata and dependencies for the 'cqlsh' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() call, specifically the 'install_requires' list and package name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration, no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup.py script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Dependencies are common Python packages related to Cassandra. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
