{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'cqlsh' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name and dependencies from the script; no external inputs are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only specifies static package information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The script is a straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' to define package metadata, mainly dependencies. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. It is a standard setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply declares dependencies for the package.",
