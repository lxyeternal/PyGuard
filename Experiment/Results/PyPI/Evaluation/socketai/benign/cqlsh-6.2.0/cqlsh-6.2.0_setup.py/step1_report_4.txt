  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the Python package 'cqlsh'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata and dependencies from the code itself, specifically the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' could be installed; no direct data leakage or untrusted input processing present.",
  "flows": "No input data flows into any sink or external system; the code merely specifies dependencies for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and conventional for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file utilizing setuptools for packaging. It specifies the package name and dependencies. No code execution, input handling, or data processing occurs. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The dependencies are common Python packages for Cassandra database interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
