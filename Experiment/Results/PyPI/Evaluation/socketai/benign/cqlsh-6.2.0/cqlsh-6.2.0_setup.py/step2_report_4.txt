  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for the 'cqlsh' package.\n- No untrusted input, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The dependencies listed are common and benign.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and adheres to typical practices.\n\n**Specific review of scores:**\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n   - No signs of malicious activity are present.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is clear, readable, and contains no obfuscation.\n\n3. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n   - No vulnerabilities or security issues are evident.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or points of challenge:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The only minor point is that, while the reports confidently state there's no malicious intent, in a real-world scenario, one might consider whether dependencies could be compromised, but that is outside the scope of this script analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0.0**.\n- The confidence level is high (1.0), which is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- Maintain confidence at 1.0.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and well-understood.",
