{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the Python package 'cqlsh' including dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; static code only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; setup configuration does not process runtime inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static package setup code without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup script with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata and dependencies. There are no input sources, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The dependencies listed ('cassandra-driver', 'pure-sasl', 'wcwidth') are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The script appears to be a standard package setup configuration, and the comments clarify its purpose. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security issues. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
