  "purpose": "This code provides a class for retrieving help topics related to CQL3 (Cassandra Query Language 3) commands and statements.",
  "sources": "The class methods that return string identifiers for help topics; no external input reading or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only returns static strings or attribute values.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs; method calls are straightforward and return fixed strings or attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists entirely of method definitions returning static string values. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods that return predefined help topic identifiers. The methods are simple, returning either fixed strings or attribute values. The class includes a method to list available topics by filtering method names. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, and no operations that could lead to code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions. The code appears to serve as a static reference or lookup for help topics related to Cassandra CQL commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility class providing static help topic references. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscated or suspicious code features. It appears safe and benign.",
