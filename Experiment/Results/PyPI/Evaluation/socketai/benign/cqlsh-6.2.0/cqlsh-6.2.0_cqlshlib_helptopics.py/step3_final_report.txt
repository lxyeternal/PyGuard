{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static class providing help topics and their descriptions related to Cassandra Query Language (CQL). It serves as a reference or documentation utility without any dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "The class inspects its own method names via dir(self) to generate a list of help topics.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The get_help_topics() method retrieves method names starting with 'help_' and returns their suffixes; get_help_topic() constructs method names from input and calls them to get static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The class contains multiple methods returning fixed strings representing help topics. The get_help_topics() method dynamically lists available help topics by inspecting method names, which is safe here. All methods are static, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code serves as a static mapping for help documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The reflection used is limited to method name inspection, which is safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static help-topic mapping class with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a reference utility, and the analysis confirms it poses no threat.",
