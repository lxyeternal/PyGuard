  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or potential issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a static, straightforward class mapping help topics to strings for CQL documentation purposes.\n- No external inputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The methods are simple getters returning fixed strings, with some dynamic listing of method names.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does **not** contain any embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The logic is consistent and simple.\n- The code is static and serves as a reference or documentation helper.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and static.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are all zero, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Score evaluations:**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The confidence level is 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n**Any adjustments needed?**\n\n- Given the consistent and thorough analysis, the scores seem appropriate.\n- No reason to increase the malware or security risk scores.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, static helper class for help topics related to Cassandra Query Language.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely static, with no external data, no dynamic execution, and no malicious patterns. The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and serves as a static documentation aid. No changes to the reported scores or reasoning are necessary.",
