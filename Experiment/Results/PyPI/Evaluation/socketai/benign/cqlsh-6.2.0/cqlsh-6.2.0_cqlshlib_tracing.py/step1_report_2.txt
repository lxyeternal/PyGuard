{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve and display tracing information for Cassandra database sessions and events.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Cassandra QueryTrace objects and session IDs, as well as system time for timestamp conversion.",
  "sinks": "The data is output via shell.print_formatted_result and shell.writeresult functions, which display the trace information to the user.",
  "flows": "The session ID is used to populate a QueryTrace object (source), then data from the trace (such as events and timestamps) is formatted and printed to the shell (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code present. The code uses standard libraries and functions. No suspicious dynamic code execution or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves Cassandra trace data via QueryTrace, formats the trace events and timestamps, and displays them. It includes standard exception handling for trace unavailability. The datetime conversion considers local time offset, and the total_micro_seconds function converts timedelta to microseconds. All functions perform straightforward data processing and output. No security issues, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling are observed. The code appears to be a standard Cassandra tracing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility for displaying Cassandra trace data. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. It appears secure and benign.",
