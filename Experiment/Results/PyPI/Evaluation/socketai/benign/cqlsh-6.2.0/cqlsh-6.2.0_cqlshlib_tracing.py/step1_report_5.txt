{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve and display tracing information from a Cassandra database session for debugging or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "session_id input in print_trace_session, trace object populated by QueryTrace, trace.events, trace.request_type, trace.started_at, trace.coordinator, trace.client, trace.duration, trace.trace_id",
  "sinks": "shell.printerr, shell.writeresult, shell.print_formatted_result, print statements that output trace information",
  "flows": "session_id from user input or external source -> QueryTrace(session_id, session) -> populate() -> make_trace_rows() -> shell output functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual data flows are detected. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code safely uses data from the Cassandra QueryTrace object to produce formatted output for tracing sessions. It includes error handling for missing traces and formats datetime and timedelta objects for display. No user input is directly used in insecure ways, and there are no network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions observed. It relies on external Cassandra query results and displays them for debugging. The code appears standard, well-structured, and does not contain suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging utility for Cassandra tracing sessions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use and does not pose supply chain threats.",
