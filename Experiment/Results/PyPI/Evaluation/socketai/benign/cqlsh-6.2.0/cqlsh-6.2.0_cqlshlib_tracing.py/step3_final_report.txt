  "purpose": "Utility for retrieving and displaying Cassandra trace data, including formatting and outputting trace events and session details.",
  "sources": "Reads trace data from QueryTrace objects, session IDs, and trace events.",
  "sinks": "Shell output functions such as printerr, writeresult, print_formatted_result, which display trace information.",
  "flows": "Trace data is fetched via QueryTrace, populated, processed into rows, and then formatted for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Time conversion uses system time, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data retrieval and formatting for Cassandra trace sessions. Exception handling is appropriate, and no external network activity or obfuscation is present. The functions handle trace data safely, converting timestamps and durations for display. No malicious or security-compromising operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Cassandra trace visualization. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are zero, and the security risk is minimal. Minor adjustment of the security risk score in one report from 0.2 to 0 would improve consistency.",
