  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Cassandra trace visualization. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are zero, and the security risk is minimal. Minor adjustment of the security risk score in one report from 0.2 to 0 would improve consistency."
