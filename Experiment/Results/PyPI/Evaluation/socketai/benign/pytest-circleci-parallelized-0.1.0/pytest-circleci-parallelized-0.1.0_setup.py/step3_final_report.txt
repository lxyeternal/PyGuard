{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring and distributing a package named 'pytest-circleci-parallelized'.",
  "sources": "Reads local 'README.md' file; static metadata in setup() call; imports only trusted modules 'setuptools' and 'os'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; all data is static or local.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package configuration script using setuptools. It imports trusted modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic inputs, external data, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code structure is clear, and the scores are consistent with the analysis. No issues or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a safe and typical configuration.",
