{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for streaming data to/from various storage backends such as S3, HDFS, local files, and compressed files, using generators and pipes for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'smart_open', local module functions ('open', 'parse_uri', 'register_compressor'), and the deprecated 's3_iter_bucket' function that internally calls 'iter_bucket' from '.s3'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code exposes functions for opening and streaming data, but does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Calls to 's3_iter_bucket' flow into 'iter_bucket' from '.s3' module; other functions are simple wrappers or import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated function 's3_iter_bucket' which logs a warning; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code is present; the code appears to be a standard utility module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions and defines a deprecated wrapper for 'iter_bucket' with a warning message. It does not handle user input directly, nor does it perform network connections or data processing itself. The use of logging and import statements is straightforward. The presence of deprecated functions with warnings is typical in maintaining backward compatibility, not malicious activity. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated elements, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for streaming data to storage backends, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The deprecated function is properly logged and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
