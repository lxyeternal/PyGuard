  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for GCS file-like access, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to handling untrusted URI inputs, but overall, the supply chain security is minimal."
