{
  "purpose": "Provides file-like objects for reading from and writing to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the google-cloud-storage library.",
  "sources": "URI parsing via parse_uri, get_blob_kwargs and blob_properties passed to open(), client initialization, and get_blob() method.",
  "sinks": "Blob open() method which allows reading ('rb') and writing ('wb') to GCS blobs.",
  "flows": "URI parsed -> open() determines mode -> Reader or Writer instantiated -> Blob retrieved via get_blob() -> Blob.open() for reading or writing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated parameters (buffer_size, line_terminator) with warnings. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual data handling observed. The code does not perform any network activity beyond calling Google Cloud APIs. The lambda for terminate() appears to be a backward compatibility stub but does not execute malicious code. No obfuscation or encoding detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up secure interactions with Google Cloud Storage using the google-cloud-storage library. It includes functions to parse GCS URIs, open blobs for reading and writing, and configure blob properties. The code properly raises exceptions if blobs are not found, and warns about deprecated parameters, but otherwise adheres to standard patterns for cloud storage interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and functionality are consistent with legitimate cloud storage utility code. No suspicious network activity or hidden code was identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for interacting with GCS. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It performs standard cloud storage operations with proper error handling and warnings. Overall, it is safe and aligns with expected usage patterns.",
