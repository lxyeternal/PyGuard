      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for HDFS access with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the absence of URI validation, which could be exploited in a worst-case scenario. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with a moderate potential for command injection if untrusted URIs are used. Implementing input validation would mitigate this risk further."

The low security risk score reflects the plugin architecture's potential for misuse if untrusted callbacks are registered, but this is an expected pattern and not inherently malicious."

The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to handling untrusted URI inputs, but overall, the supply chain security is minimal."

The minor security concern relates to unvalidated input, which is typical for such functions but does not indicate malicious intent. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary."
