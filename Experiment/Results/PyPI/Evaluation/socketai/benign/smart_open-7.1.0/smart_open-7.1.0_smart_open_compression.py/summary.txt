  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard utility module for managing compression handlers within the smart_open library. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects the plugin architecture's potential for misuse if untrusted callbacks are registered, but this is an expected pattern and not inherently malicious."
