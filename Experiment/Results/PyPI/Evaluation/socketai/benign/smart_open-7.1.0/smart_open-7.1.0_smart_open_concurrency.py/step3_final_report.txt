{
  "purpose": "Provides concurrency management through thread or process pools with environment-aware fallbacks.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules; checks for module availability; creates pool objects based on environment flags.",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted input is processed; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Pool creation functions instantiate and yield pool objects; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code manages concurrency pools using standard Python libraries, with environment checks and fallbacks. It does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain obfuscated code. The design is typical for utility modules, and no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard concurrency utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
