{
  "purpose": "Provides common functionality for concurrent processing using threading or multiprocessing, allowing flexible pool creation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (concurrent.futures, multiprocessing.pool), potentially from external libraries, and reads environment settings via try-except blocks.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating thread or process pools based on availability and configuration; no external data flows or malicious actions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. Uses standard concurrency patterns and warnings for missing modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard concurrency modules, creates wrapper classes for thread and process pools, and provides a context manager for pool creation. It contains no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or hidden backdoors. The usage appears to be for facilitating concurrency in a safe, conventional manner. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of concurrency pool management, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply abstracts thread and process pools for concurrent task execution, with proper fallback handling.",
