  "purpose": "Provides an interface to read from and write to HDFS using command-line utilities, parsing URIs to invoke 'hdfs dfs' commands via subprocess.",
  "sources": "URI parsing functions, subprocess invocation with URI as argument",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing 'hdfs dfs' commands with user-provided URIs",
  "flows": "URI input -> parse_uri -> open_uri -> subprocess command with URI -> data read/write",
  "anomalies": "Lack of URI validation or sanitization before passing to subprocess; no input sanitization measures",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around HDFS command-line tools, with URI parsing and subprocess invocation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The subprocess calls are made with argument lists, reducing injection risk, but the URI is used directly without validation, which could be exploited if malicious URIs are supplied. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The overall structure is standard and safe, with the main potential vulnerability being unvalidated input leading to command injection. The malware score is therefore 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to lack of input sanitization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for HDFS access with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the absence of URI validation, which could be exploited in a worst-case scenario. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with a moderate potential for command injection if untrusted URIs are used. Implementing input validation would mitigate this risk further.",
