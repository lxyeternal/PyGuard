  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for HDFS access with no signs of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the absence of URI validation, which could be exploited in a worst-case scenario. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with a moderate potential for command injection if untrusted URIs are used. Implementing input validation would mitigate this risk further."
