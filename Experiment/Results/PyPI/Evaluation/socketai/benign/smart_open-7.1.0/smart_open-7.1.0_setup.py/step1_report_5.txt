  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'smart_open' Python package, used for streaming large files from various storage services.",
  "sources": "Reads local files ('version.py' and 'README.rst') and processes package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and description files; processes dependencies; executes setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data exfiltration points.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a local file and package descriptions. It constructs dependencies and metadata for package distribution. The code is standard for a setup.py script, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No external or untrusted data flows are detected, and no suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
