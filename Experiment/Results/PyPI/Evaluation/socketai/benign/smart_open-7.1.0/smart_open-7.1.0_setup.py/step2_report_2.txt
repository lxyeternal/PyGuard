  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Sources & Flows: Reads version from a local file; no external data or user input.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, typical setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources & Flows: Reads version info locally; no external data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard packaging code, no dynamic code execution or network activity.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Sources & Flows: Reads version info from a local file; no external data flows.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources & Flows: Reads version info locally; no external data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, safe setup process.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Sources & Flows: Local file reads; no external or untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup code.\n- Conclusion: No issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard setup.py script, performing common tasks such as reading version info from a local file and defining dependencies.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or external data fetching.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the script is a typical package setup file.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (standard, safe package setup script).\n\n### Justification:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows. The code only reads local files and sets up package metadata and dependencies, which is typical and safe.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior. |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected.           |\n\n**Overall, this is a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns.**",
