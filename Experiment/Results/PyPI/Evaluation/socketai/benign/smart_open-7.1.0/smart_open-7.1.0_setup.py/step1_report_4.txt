  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'smart_open' Python module, including dependency management and version retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'smart_open/version.py' and reads files for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data effects observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file, loads package metadata, dependencies, and configuration data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a file, constructs dependency lists, and configures package setup parameters. It avoids executing external code for version retrieval by reading file contents directly. No network operations, command execution, or sensitive data handling are present. The dependencies are standard for a Python package that handles file streaming and cloud storage integrations. No suspicious code or behaviors are found.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
