  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'smart_open' Python library, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'smart_open/version.py' and long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data flows during execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version string locally; no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads version info from a local file, defines dependencies explicitly, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated operations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The dependencies are standard and static. The version is obtained via reading a file, which is a common pattern. Overall, the script is safe, benign, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
