  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**  \n   The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project. It reads version info from a local file, specifies dependencies, and calls `setuptools.setup()`. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, obfuscated segments, or any form of malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Potential vulnerabilities or anomalies:**  \n   The only somewhat dynamic part is `_get_version()`, which reads the version string from a file (`version.py`). This is a common pattern and does not introduce security issues or malicious behavior. The code explicitly avoids importing the version module to prevent dependency issues during setup, which is a standard practice.\n\n3. **Dependency management and data flows:**  \n   All dependencies are explicitly listed and are static. No untrusted data flows or external data fetching occur during setup.\n\n4. **Malware or malicious intent:**  \n   There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n5. **Scores assessment:**  \n   - **Malware score:** Given the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is appropriate.  \n   - **Risk score:** Since the script is a standard setup configuration with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a low risk score (e.g., 0) is justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard setup script with no security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis matches the analysis and the evidence provided. There are no indications of malicious activity or security issues in this code.",
