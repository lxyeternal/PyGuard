{
  "purpose": "Provides HTTP(S) file-like objects for reading data streams with support for authentication, buffering, and seeking.",
  "sources": "URL input, request headers, and optional user credentials or certificates.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted URL and headers, which could be exploited if malicious URLs are supplied.",
  "flows": "Input URL and headers -> HTTP request -> data stream -> buffered read operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard HTTP streaming with optional authentication (Kerberos, basic) and seek support. It uses common libraries (`requests`, `urllib`) and handles errors appropriately. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The main security concern is misuse via malicious URLs or headers, which is typical for network I/O libraries but not indicative of malicious intent within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of HTTP(S) streaming with authentication and seeking capabilities. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, reflecting potential misuse but not inherent malicious behavior.",
