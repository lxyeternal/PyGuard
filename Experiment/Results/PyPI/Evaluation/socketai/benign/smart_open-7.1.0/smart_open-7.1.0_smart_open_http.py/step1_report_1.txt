{
  "purpose": "Implement file-like objects for reading data from HTTP(S) sources, supporting authenticated and seekable streaming.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL parsing in parse_uri, user-supplied URLs, and request parameters such as headers, authentication info, and timeout.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks are the internal buffers (_read_buffer) and the final data returned by read() and related methods.",
  "flows": "Input (URL, headers, credentials) → HTTP request via requests or requests_kerberos → data streamed into internal buffers → read() methods output data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for streaming HTTP data; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network connections are evident. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors identified. No apparent backdoors or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes HTTP(S) connections with options for authentication (Kerberos, basic auth). It implements stream reading, buffering, and seeking support through HTTP range headers. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network behaviors are present. It uses standard libraries and well-known patterns for HTTP streaming, with proper error handling. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or covert communication channels. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for reading remote files via HTTP(S).",
  "conclusion": "This module implements standard HTTP streaming functionality with support for authentication and seeking, without any signs of malicious or sabotage behaviors. It relies on common libraries and practices, and does not include suspicious code. It appears safe and purposeful.",
