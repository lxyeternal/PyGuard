{
  "purpose": "To handle file:// URIs by parsing and opening local files with support for user home expansion.",
  "sources": "The function parse_uri and open_uri read the URI string; extract_local_path reads and modifies the input URI.",
  "sinks": "io.open is used to open files based on the parsed URI path.",
  "flows": "parse_uri calls extract_local_path to process input; open_uri calls parse_uri and then opens the resulting path using io.open.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code simply handles local file paths and supports URI schemes. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to parse 'file://' URIs, expand user paths, and open files accordingly. It uses standard Python libraries with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling. The functions perform straightforward URI parsing and file opening. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a utility module for local file access.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for handling local file URIs. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
