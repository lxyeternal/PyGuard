{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse and open local files specified by file:// URIs.",
  "sources": "The function parse_uri and open_uri read the input URI string; extract_local_path reads the URI string to determine local file path.",
  "sinks": "The open function from io opens the file at the local path with specified mode, potentially leading to local file access.",
  "flows": "URI string → parse_uri extracts path → open_uri opens the file at the extracted path.",
  "anomalies": "The code straightforwardly maps URI to local file path; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. It performs simple string replacements and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard method to parse 'file://' URIs and open local files accordingly. There are no suspicious code paths, no data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose of accessing local files based on URI inputs. The functions do not handle untrusted input beyond converting URIs to local paths, which could be misused if user input is malicious, but this is typical for such functionality and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a basic utility to parse and open local files from file URIs without any suspicious or malicious logic. No malware or security risks are apparent from the code presented.",
