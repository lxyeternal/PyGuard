{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse and open file URIs using the file:// schema, mainly for local file access.",
  "sources": "Reads input from URI strings provided to parse_uri and open_uri functions.",
  "targets": "Uses io.open to open local files specified by the URI paths.",
  "flows": "URI string input -> extract_local_path() -> parse_uri() -> open_uri() -> io.open() -> file access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Uses standard library functions without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code handles local file URIs by parsing and expanding user directories, then opens the files using io.open. It does not perform network operations or execute any code. No obfuscated code features or unusual behavior are detected. The functions are straightforward and serve a specific purpose for local file access.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling file URIs for local file access, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages local file paths and opens files accordingly.",
