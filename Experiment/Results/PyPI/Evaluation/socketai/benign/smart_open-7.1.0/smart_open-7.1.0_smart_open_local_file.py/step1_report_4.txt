  "purpose": "Implement transport functions for handling file:// URIs, including parsing and opening files locally.",
  "sources": "Input URI strings provided to parse_uri, open_uri, and extract_local_path functions.",
  "targets": "File system access via io.open, which reads or writes to local file paths derived from URIs.",
  "flows": "URI string -> parse_uri -> extract_local_path -> io.open to access files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of untrusted data beyond standard file path handling. No external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to parse and open local files based on file URIs. It safely extracts local paths, expands user directories, and opens files with io.open. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data leakage, network transmission, or backdoor creation. The code relies on standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It appears to be straightforward utility code for file access with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple implementation of local file URI parsing and access, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations securely and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code elements.",
