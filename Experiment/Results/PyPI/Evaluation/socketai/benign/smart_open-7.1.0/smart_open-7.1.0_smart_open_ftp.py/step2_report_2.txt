  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings, scores, and the underlying code logic.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard FTP/FTPS client implementation, focusing on URL parsing, connection setup, and file transfer.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are reported.\n- The code uses SSL context for FTPS, which is standard.\n- The connection and transfer logic follow typical patterns, with proper error handling and resource cleanup.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware is identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears correct and functional for its purpose.\n- No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are consistent with the code analysis.\n- Security risk is low (~0.2), which aligns with the code being a standard utility.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The report's reasoning is sound; it correctly identifies the code as a legitimate FTP/FTPS client.\n- No errors or flaws in logic or implementation are evident.\n- The scoring appears reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk (~0.2):** Justified given the network operations and parameter handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- While the code is standard, it relies on user-supplied parameters (host, username, password, URI), which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, this is typical for such utilities and not specific to this code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.\n- No obfuscation or malicious payloads are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate for network utility code with user input handling)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code's functionality.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n- The code appears safe and legitimate from a supply chain security perspective.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented FTP/FTPS client utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nIf you need further detailed analysis or have additional reports, please let me know.",
