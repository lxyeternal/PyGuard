{
  "purpose": "Implements I/O streams over FTP/FTPS protocols, allowing opening and reading/writing files on remote servers.",
  "sources": "URI parsing functions (`parse_uri`), open_uri function, and open function which establish FTP/FTPS connections and transfer files.",
  "sinks": "FTP connection, login, and file transfer commands (`connect`, `login`, `transfercmd`, `makefile`). These can execute user-provided data such as host, username, password, and file paths.",
  "flows": "URI input -> parse_uri extracts connection details -> open_uri calls open -> connect establishes FTP connection -> login authenticates -> transfercmd executes commands with user-supplied file paths -> file object returned for read/write.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration present. Use of standard libraries and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation for FTP/FTPS file operations. It handles URI parsing, connection setup, login, and file transfer with configurable parameters. The connection and data transfer steps utilize user-provided inputs like host, username, password, and file paths, which are typical in FTP client implementations. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activities such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage are evident. The use of SSL context and secure connection options aligns with best practices for secure FTP connections. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended solely for file transfer purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical FTP/FTPS client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely manages connections and file transfers based on user inputs. No indicators of malware or supply chain compromise are detected.",
