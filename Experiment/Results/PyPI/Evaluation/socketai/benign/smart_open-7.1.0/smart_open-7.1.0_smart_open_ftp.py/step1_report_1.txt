{
  "purpose": "Implements FTP/FTPS file access via URL parsing and connection management for reading and writing files.",
  "sources": "URI input string to parse scheme, host, path, username, password; user credentials in parse_uri and open functions; connection parameters in open_uri and open functions.",
  "sinks": "FTP connection and login functions; transfer commands (RETR, STOR); socket's makefile method; close method override.",
  "flows": "parse_uri extracts credentials and host info; open_uri passes data to open which calls _connect; _connect establishes FTP/FTPS connection; open performs transfer commands; file object close method closes socket and connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns found. Use of SSL context for FTPS is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed. Logging is standard for error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code handles FTP/FTPS file transfers, with proper URL parsing, secure connection options, and connection management. Credentials are supplied via parameters, not hardcoded. The connection and file transfer processes follow standard protocols. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity. No suspicious or obfuscated code present. The only potential concern could be if transport_params include sensitive data, but this is typical for configuration, not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a standard FTP/FTPS client implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate FTP/FTPS file handler with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations with proper error handling and connection management. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
