{
  "purpose": "Implementing I/O streams over FTP/FTPS protocols for reading and writing files on remote servers.",
  "sources": "URI parsing in parse_uri, input parameters for open_uri and open functions, environment variables potentially used in transport_params.",
  "sinks": "ftp.connect, ftp.login, ftp.prot_p, ftp.transfercmd, socket.makefile, socket.close, conn.close",
  "flows": "parse_uri extracts credentials and connection details from URI -> open uses these details to connect and transfer files -> transfercmd creates data streams that are closed via full_close",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network destinations or external data exfiltration; standard use of libraries; no code injections or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for FTP/FTPS file transfer, involving parsing of URI strings, establishing connections, and handling file streams. It securely manages connections with optional SSL context for FTPS. The connection setup, login, and data transfer steps follow typical procedures. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. All functions appear to handle their tasks straightforwardly with appropriate error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation for FTP/FTPS file transfer with no detectable malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Overall, it is a benign utility module for remote file operations.",
