  "purpose": "Implementing input/output streams over FTP and FTPS protocols for file transfer operations.",
  "sources": "URI parsing functions (parse_uri), open_uri function, and open function that read and process connection parameters, URI strings, and method parameters for FTP/FTPS connections.",
  "sinks": "Connection establishment (ftp.connect, ftp.login), transfer commands (transfercmd), and file object close method, which could potentially be misused for unintended data transfer or resource management.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like URI or connection details flow into parse_uri or open, then into _connect for establishing the connection, followed by transfer command execution (transfercmd), and finally file object operations (close).",
  "anomalies": "Standard use of SSL context for FTPS, no hardcoded credentials; warning logs for unsupported parameters; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors; proper error handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles FTP and FTPS connections by parsing URIs and connection parameters, establishing connections with SSL context where needed, and managing file transfers with proper resource cleanup. The functions check for required parameters, handle exceptions, and do not contain suspicious or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malware-like behavior observed. Logging provides transparency for errors and unsupported parameters. Usage of third-party libraries (ftplib, urllib) appears standard and safe. Overall, the code appears legitimate with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities from a supply chain perspective.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for FTP/FTPS file I/O operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration detected. It manages connection setup and file transfer properly, with appropriate error handling and logging. No obfuscation or malware identified.",
