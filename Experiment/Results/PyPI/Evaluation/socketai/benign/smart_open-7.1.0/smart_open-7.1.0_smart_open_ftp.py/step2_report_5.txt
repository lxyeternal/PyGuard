  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scoring reflects the actual risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe a standard FTP/FTPS client implementation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are detected.\n- The code handles URI parsing, connection setup, authentication, and file transfer in a typical manner.\n- The malware scores are all 0, with high confidence (0.9), indicating no malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.2), consistent with a benign utility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors. They all describe standard, well-structured code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No explicit errors or flaws are noted. The code appears to follow best practices for FTP/FTPS handling.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning mistakes:\n\n- The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and operations.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made without evidence.\n- The assessments are consistent and cautious.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct; no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk (0.2):** Slightly conservative, considering potential misuses of user inputs, but overall acceptable.\n\n### Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):\n\n- None of the reports assign scores >0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The code's functionality is standard and does not pose significant security risks on its own.\n\n### Potential concerns or assumptions:\n\n- Some reports mention that user inputs (URIs, parameters) could be exploited if maliciously crafted, but this is inherent to any network client handling user input.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven all the evidence, the code is a legitimate FTP/FTPS client implementation with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and conservative.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minimal, typical for network code with user input handling)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign FTP/FTPS utility with no supply chain security issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action needed. The code appears safe and well-implemented.",
