{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility API for opening files, URIs, and streams with support for compression, encoding, and various transport protocols, ensuring flexible resource access.",
  "sources": "URI strings, pathlib.Path objects, file descriptors, and streams; reads configuration parameters for mode, encoding, compression, and transport options.",
  "sinks": "Places where untrusted data could flow include URI parsing, transport layer modules, and decompression wrappers; however, no direct data leakage or malicious data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "URI input → scheme detection → transport module parsing → local or remote resource opening → optional decompression → optional decoding → file-like object returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of warnings and deprecated functions are for backward compatibility and are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured resource handler supporting multiple protocols and compression schemes. It uses standard Python modules, with no embedded malicious logic or obfuscation. The transport modules are external and assumed safe. No network connections or data exfiltration are present. The backward compatibility features and warnings are typical for mature open-source projects. The security-related functions and wrappers operate within expected parameters, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility for resource access with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the risk score reflects minimal security concern. All evidence supports that this code is safe for use.",
