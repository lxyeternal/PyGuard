  "purpose": "This code implements parsing and matching of HTTP Accept headers for MIME types, validating input and selecting the best response type based on client preferences.",
  "sources": "Reads the Accept header string, splits it into MIME types, and extracts 'q' parameters for quality weighting.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex matching to validate and compare MIME types; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Accept header string -> parse_header() -> AcceptableType instances -> matches() method -> selection of best MIME type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; regex patterns are static and straightforward; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard MIME type validation and matching using regex patterns, handling wildcards and quality parameters. It does not execute dynamic code, access external systems, or contain hidden malicious logic. Error handling is minimal but sufficient for validation. The regex validation ensures only well-formed MIME types are accepted. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The logic is consistent with common MIME negotiation implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of MIME type parsing and matching, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given the context.",
