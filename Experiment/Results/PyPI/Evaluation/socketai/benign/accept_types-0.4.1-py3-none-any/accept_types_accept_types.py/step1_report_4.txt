{
  "purpose": "The code processes HTTP Accept headers to determine the best MIME type match from supported types.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'header' parameter in 'get_best_match' and 'parse_header', which come from HTTP request headers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code primarily processes and compares string data and regex patterns without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Accept header input -> parsing into AcceptableType objects -> matching against available types -> selecting best match.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Use of regex is straightforward and controlled. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely parses and processes MIME types using regex and object models. It validates MIME type formats, handles 'q' parameters for quality, and matches types via regex patterns. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. The functions are well-structured and do not perform unsafe operations. The overall logic is standard for handling MIME type negotiation, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate header parsing and MIME type matching without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP Accept header processing, with no malicious behavior detected.",
