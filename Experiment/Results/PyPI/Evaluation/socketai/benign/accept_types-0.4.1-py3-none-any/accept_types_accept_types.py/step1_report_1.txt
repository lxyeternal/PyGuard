{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to parse, validate, and match HTTP 'Accept' headers with supported MIME types, determining the best response format for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input 'header' parameter from HTTP request headers in parse_header() and get_best_match(), and the raw_mime_type string passed to AcceptableType constructor.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output to external systems, network, or file system. It processes data internally for MIME type negotiation. No sinks are evident that could lead to data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "The flow starts with parse_header() parsing the header string into AcceptableType objects, which use regex validation and parsing. get_best_match() iterates over acceptable types and available types to find the best match based on pattern matching. The code primarily manipulates internal data structures without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The regex patterns are standard, and there are no dynamic code execution or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements MIME type parsing and matching with appropriate regex validation. It uses regex compilation for pattern matching MIME types, including wildcards. Error handling is minimal but acceptable for parsing. No external system calls, network operations, or insecure practices are observed. The code adheres to standard MIME negotiation logic. All operations are confined to internal data processing without potential for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP Accept header parsing and MIME type matching. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified. It appears to be a benign component of a web application handling content negotiation securely.",
