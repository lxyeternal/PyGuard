{
  "purpose": "The code parses and evaluates HTTP Accept headers to determine the best matching MIME type from a list of supported types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'header' parameter in get_best_match() and parse_header() functions, which are intended to receive HTTP Accept headers.",
  "sinks": "The code uses regular expressions to match MIME types; potential sinks include any use of get_best_match() output to serve or process content based on client preferences.",
  "flows": "Input from header parameter flows through parse_header() to create AcceptableType instances, which are then matched against available_types in get_best_match() to select the best response type.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex matching with user-provided header content poses minimal risk; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious payloads detected. No unsafe code injection or system commands present. No external network communication or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard MIME type parsing and matching logic, utilizing regex patterns to validate and match MIME types, including wildcards. The AcceptableType class encapsulates MIME type and quality factor parsing. Functions are well-structured, with input validation and error handling for invalid MIME types. No suspicious or malicious behavior found; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data transfers. The code is safe and appears to be a typical implementation of content negotiation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, secure implementation of HTTP Accept header parsing and MIME type matching with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It safely processes input data and provides correct MIME type selection logic. The overall security risk is very low.",
