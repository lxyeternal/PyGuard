{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to parse and evaluate HTTP 'Accept' headers for content negotiation based on mime types and their quality factors.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'header' parameter in get_best_match() and parse_header(), which receives the HTTP 'Accept' header string.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data processing beyond parsing and pattern matching. No external outputs or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "The header string flows into parse_header() -> AcceptableType instances, which parse mime types and quality factors. These are then used in get_best_match() to find matching supported types.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses dynamic regex patterns but constructs them from fixed mime type strings; no signs of obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. Exception handling is limited but appropriate. No malicious code such as system commands, network communication, or data exfiltration is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly parses 'Accept' headers, matches mime types with support for wildcards, and handles quality factors. It uses safe regex patterns, and all user input is handled via string splitting and regex matching, with proper exception handling for invalid mime types. No unsafe code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior identified. The logic aligns with standard content negotiation procedures without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe, standard parsing of HTTP 'Accept' headers with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It is a legitimate utility for mime type negotiation. No security risks or obfuscation detected.",
