  "purpose": "This code module re-exports specific functions and classes from the local 'accept_types' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local 'accept_types' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code imports symbols from 'accept_types' and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is minimal and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, a __all__ declaration, and future imports, with no dynamic execution, external input handling, or network operations. It functions as a simple re-export module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) reflects the straightforward, static structure. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module re-export with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
