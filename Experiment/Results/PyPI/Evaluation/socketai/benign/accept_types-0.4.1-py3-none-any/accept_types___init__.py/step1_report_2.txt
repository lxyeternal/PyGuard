{
  "purpose": "This module appears to facilitate handling and parsing of content types, likely for HTTP headers or similar protocols.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from a relative module named 'accept_types'. It does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists within the provided code, as it only performs import and export operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard import statements and explicitly defines its exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of future import directives, an import from a local module, and an __all__ declaration. It appears to be a simple module re-exporting functions/classes from another module. There is no dynamic execution, external input handling, or suspicious logic. The absence of external data handling and straightforward import/export patterns do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that re-exports specific functions and classes from a local module. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe practice for organizing module exports.",
