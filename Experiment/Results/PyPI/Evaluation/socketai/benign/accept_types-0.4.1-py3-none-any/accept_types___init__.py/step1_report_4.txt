{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for functions related to handling 'accept' headers and types, likely for HTTP content negotiation.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.accept_types' for specific functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is primarily import/export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific functions and classes from a local module and defining __all__ for module exports. It uses future imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network interactions are present. The code structure and content are standard for a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages module exports and imports functions/classes from a local module.",
