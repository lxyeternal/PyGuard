  "purpose": "Define module exports and import functions related to HTTP Accept header handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'accept_types'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable usage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific functions and types from a local module 'accept_types' and exposes them via __all__. It uses future imports for compatibility. No code reads external input, writes data, or performs any operations that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for module initialization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
