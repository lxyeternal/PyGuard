  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Django comment model, no malicious code, no obfuscation, no external code execution, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is purely model definitions with URL generation and user info handling.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n- The risk score of 0.2 seems a bit high given the lack of any vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Lower the security risk score to 0.1 or 0, as no real risk is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard Django comment model, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Same reasoning applies.  \n- The code is straightforward, with no external code execution or secrets.  \n- The risk score could be lowered slightly.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Reduce risk to 0.1 or 0, malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical Django comment model, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard URL handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.  \n- The risk score appears inflated.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Lower risk to 0.1 or 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues detected.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Reduce risk score accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, standard Django comment model, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Lower risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all are straightforward models.  \n- **Risk score:** The current 0.2 for each seems high. Given the code is purely model definitions with URL generation and user info handling, the actual security risk is minimal.\n\n### Final estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk:** 0 or very close to 0, perhaps 0.05 at most, to account for minimal risk due to potential misconfiguration but no actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard Django comment model with no malicious or obfuscated code. The risk scores should be lowered to reflect the absence of real security issues.",
