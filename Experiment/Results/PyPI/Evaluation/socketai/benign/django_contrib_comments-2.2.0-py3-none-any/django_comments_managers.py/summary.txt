  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django custom manager with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk scores are justified as they acknowledge potential misuse of the 'model' parameter but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and the assessments are accurate."
