  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a standard pattern for maintaining compatibility across Django versions.\n- The code only performs import operations within a try-except block, with no data processing, user input, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The purpose is purely compatibility management, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` from `django.utils.http` if available; otherwise, it falls back to `is_safe_url`, aliasing it as `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme`.\n- The fallback is simply an alias, not an attempt to execute or manipulate data.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external effects are involved.\n- The logic is straightforward and common in version compatibility code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only possible concern could be if the fallback `is_safe_url` function is malicious or has security implications. However, `is_safe_url` is a standard Django utility function, and aliasing it here is safe.\n- The reports do not mention whether `is_safe_url` is imported from the same module or elsewhere, but given the context, it's a standard fallback pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just to acknowledge that it's a compatibility utility, but still negligible)\n\nThis code does not pose any security threat. The reports are accurate in their assessments.",
