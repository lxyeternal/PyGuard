{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility imports for Django to avoid deprecation warnings, ensuring consistent usage of URL validation functions across different Django versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django package's 'django.utils.http' module to import 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme' or its alias 'is_safe_url'.",
  "sinks": "The imported function is intended for validating URLs, which can be a sink if used improperly, but here it's only imported, not used.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme' from Django; if it fails, it imports 'is_safe_url' as an alias, providing compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with standard try-except import handling for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of a Django function 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme'. If unavailable (possibly in older Django versions), it falls back to importing 'is_safe_url' under the same name. This is a common compatibility pattern. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code is solely concerned with maintaining compatibility across Django versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple compatibility shim for Django URL validation functions, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any operations beyond importing functions for later use.",
