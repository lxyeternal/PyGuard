{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility imports for Django functions to prevent deprecation warnings across different Django versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements from the 'django.utils.http' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme' from Django 3.0+. If the import fails (e.g., in earlier Django versions), it falls back to importing 'is_safe_url' as 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme'. This ensures compatibility across Django versions without executing any untrusted code or network operations. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple compatibility shim for Django functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
