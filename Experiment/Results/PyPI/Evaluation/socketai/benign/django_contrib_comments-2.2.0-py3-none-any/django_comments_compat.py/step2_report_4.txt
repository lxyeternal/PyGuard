  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\nThe code is a simple try-except import pattern to handle compatibility between Django versions regarding the URL validation functions. It imports `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` if available (Django 3.0+), otherwise falls back to `is_safe_url`. There are no data flows, no user input handling, no external network calls, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, well-understood, and commonly used for compatibility purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The report accurately describes the purpose and implementation.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware, securityRisk, obfuscated) are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The explanation matches the code's logic.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The analysis correctly interprets the fallback pattern.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The report correctly notes the import pattern and its purpose.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The description aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zeros are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code does not perform any dangerous operations.\n- It is a standard compatibility pattern.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately score the code as benign. No further action or concern is necessary.",
