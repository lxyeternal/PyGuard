{
  "purpose": "This module aims to provide compatibility for the function 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme' across different Django versions to prevent deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statements to load a specific function from 'django.utils.http'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import a function and falls back to an alternative if the import fails; no data flows or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a standard version compatibility pattern; no anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is to handle compatibility for Django imports, with a try-except block managing import errors. No user input, untrusted data, or dangerous operations are present. The fallback method 'is_safe_url' is simply an alias for the deprecated function, with no malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for compatibility management without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
