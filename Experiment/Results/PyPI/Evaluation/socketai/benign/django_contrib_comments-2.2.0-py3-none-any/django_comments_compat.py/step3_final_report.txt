  "purpose": "Provides compatibility imports for Django URL functions to prevent deprecation warnings across different Django versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from django.utils.http, attempting to import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme or is_safe_url.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only performs imports without processing data or executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Import attempt flows from django.utils.http to local namespace; no data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import fallback pattern, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme from django.utils.http, falling back to is_safe_url if ImportError occurs. It serves as a compatibility layer to handle different Django versions. There are no data inputs, no data processing, no network calls, and no suspicious behavior. The pattern is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The fallback simply aliases an existing function, maintaining compatibility without security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0). The code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
