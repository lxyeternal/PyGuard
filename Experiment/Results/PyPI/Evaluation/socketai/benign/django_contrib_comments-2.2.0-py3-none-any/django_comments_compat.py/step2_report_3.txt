  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a try-except import pattern to handle compatibility for Django's URL validation functions.\n- The code only performs import operations, with no data processing, external calls, or user input handling.\n- The fallback function 'is_safe_url' is simply aliased to the deprecated function, with no malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified across reports.\n- All reports assign a security risk, malware, or obfuscated score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a common pattern for maintaining compatibility across library versions.\n- The only potential concern could be if the fallback function 'is_safe_url' were malicious or misused, but in this context, it's just an alias for a deprecated, but still known, Django function.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, or external network activity.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- Security risk score: 0 is appropriate; the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports' scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign compatibility utility.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n- The overall risk assessment should remain very low, with no suspicion of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe pattern for handling library version differences without any malicious intent.",
