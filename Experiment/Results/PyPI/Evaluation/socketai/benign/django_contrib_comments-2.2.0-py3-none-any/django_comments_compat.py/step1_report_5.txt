{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility imports for Django to avoid deprecation warnings, ensuring compatibility across different Django versions.",
  "sources": "The import statements where the code attempts to import 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme' or 'is_safe_url' from 'django.utils.http'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data handling, output, or external calls in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow involves trying to import a function, and falling back to an alternative if the first import fails. No data flows or processing beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs a standard version compatibility check with safe import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to import a function for URL validation from Django. It first attempts to import 'url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme', which is available in Django 3.0 and above. If an ImportError occurs (indicating an older Django version), it falls back to importing 'is_safe_url'. This is a common compatibility pattern. No data processing, external network activity, or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility shim for Django URL functions. It performs no malicious or security-sensitive operations. It is safe and typical for maintaining compatibility across different Django versions.",
