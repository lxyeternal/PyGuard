{
  "purpose": "The code aims to provide compatibility imports for Django functions to avoid deprecation warnings across different Django versions.",
  "sources": "The import statement from django.utils.http, which reads the module to access specific functions.",
  "sinks": "The imported functions could be used later in the codebase, but no direct sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source (import) may lead to using either url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme or is_safe_url, depending on the Django version.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with a conditional import pattern; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a function from django.utils.http. If the import fails (ImportError), it falls back to importing an alternative function. This pattern ensures compatibility across Django versions. No external data, user input, or network operations are involved. The structure is simple and common for maintaining backwards compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious logic, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Django imports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for maintaining compatibility across Django versions.",
