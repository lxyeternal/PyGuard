  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a simple try-except import pattern for compatibility across Django versions.\n- The code only imports functions from `django.utils.http`, with no data processing, user input, or external network calls.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The purpose is purely to maintain compatibility and avoid deprecation warnings.\n- The code is benign and standard practice.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not execute any untrusted data, nor does it contain any sinks that could be exploited.\n- The fallback to `is_safe_url` as an alias for `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme` is a common pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The import failure handling is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: all 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- Security risk: all 0, as there's no active operation or data handling.\n- The reports' reasoning and conclusions are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- There are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The code is a minimal compatibility shim, with no security implications.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Risk: **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign compatibility utility with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
