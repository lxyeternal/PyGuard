      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure Django model implementation for comment and flag management. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor concern regarding unvalidated user input in 'flag' does not constitute a security vulnerability in this context. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.05-0.1) are justified and should be maintained."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django utility module for pluggable comment apps, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected. The use of dynamic import based on configuration is typical but warrants proper validation of settings. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low risk primarily due to configuration reliance. The assessments across all reports are consistent and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django custom manager with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk scores are justified as they acknowledge potential misuse of the 'model' parameter but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and the assessments are accurate."
