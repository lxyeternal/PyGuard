  "purpose": "Defines Django signals for comment moderation events, enabling decoupled handling of comment lifecycle actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only declares signal objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; signals are placeholders for receiver functions, not processing data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow; signals are emitted and received elsewhere, not within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard for Django signal declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three Django signals related to comment events, with clear documentation. It contains no data processing, external data handling, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is a standard, benign implementation of Django signals for comment moderation workflows. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with its simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard Django signals module for comment events, posing no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are justified and require no adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
