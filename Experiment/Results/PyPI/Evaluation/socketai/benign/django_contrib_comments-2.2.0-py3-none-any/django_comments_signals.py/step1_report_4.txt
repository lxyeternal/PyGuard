  "purpose": "Define Django signals related to comment lifecycle events such as posting and flagging comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines signals within the application.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or stored.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the code only declares signals.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines three Django signals to be used elsewhere in the application for comment event notifications. It contains no data processing, external input, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden logic is present. The signals are standard Django constructs for decoupled event handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of signals with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is benign and intended for normal application workflow.",
