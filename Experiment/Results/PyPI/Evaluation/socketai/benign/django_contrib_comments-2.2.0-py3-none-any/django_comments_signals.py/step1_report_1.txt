{
  "purpose": "Define Django signals related to comment moderation and posting events.",
  "sources": "The code defines signal objects that are used to emit events at various stages of comment processing.",
  "sinks": "The signal objects themselves are used as triggers; they do not process untrusted data directly but are connected to receiver functions that might handle data.",
  "flows": "Signals are emitted during comment lifecycle events; data such as 'comment', 'request', 'flag', 'created' flows from the point of event trigger to connected receivers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Django signal definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three Django Signal instances to handle comment-related events: 'comment_will_be_posted', 'comment_was_posted', and 'comment_was_flagged'. These signals facilitate modular event handling in a Django project. The comments clarify their purpose and arguments, which are typical for such signals. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation, is evident. Usage appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines signals for comment moderation workflows. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this implementation. It functions as expected for Django event signaling.",
