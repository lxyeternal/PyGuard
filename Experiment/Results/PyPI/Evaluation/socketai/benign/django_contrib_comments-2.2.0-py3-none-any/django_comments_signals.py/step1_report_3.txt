{
  "purpose": "Define and emit Django signals related to comment actions such as posting and flagging.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the signal definitions and comments describing their usage; no external data inputs are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing are present in this code; signals are used internally within Django framework.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows involving untrusted input; the signals are placeholders for external receivers, but no malicious flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and standard for Django signals.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three Django signals related to comment lifecycle events. These signals are intended for use within a Django application to allow external functions to hook into comment posting and flagging processes. No input handling, external data processing, or suspicious code constructs are present. The comments provide detailed usage descriptions but do not suggest malicious intent. The code's simplicity and standard pattern reduce the likelihood of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Django signals for comment-related events with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as an event notifier framework within a Django app and does not include any suspicious or malicious code.",
