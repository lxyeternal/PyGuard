  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines three Django signals:\n     - `comment_will_be_posted`\n     - `comment_was_posted`\n     - `comment_was_flagged`\n   - The purpose of these signals is to facilitate comment moderation workflows within a Django application.\n   - The code is straightforward, with clear comments explaining each signal's purpose and arguments.\n   - No data processing, input handling, or external data fetching occurs here.\n   - No secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely declarative, defining signals for internal use.\n   - Signals are a standard Django pattern for decoupled event handling.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n   - The reports uniformly agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears correct and idiomatic for Django signal definitions.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n   - The arguments for each signal are appropriate and well-documented.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Since the code is safe, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential for Misinterpretation:**\n   - The reports mention that signals are used as triggers for other functions, which could, if misused, lead to security issues. However, the code itself does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard signal usage.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign implementation of Django signals for comment moderation.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The risk score should remain at 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- The malware score should stay at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The overall security risk should remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.",
