  "purpose": "Define Django signals related to comment moderation and actions",
  "sources": "Import from django.dispatch and signal definitions",
  "sinks": "Potentially any receiver functions connected to these signals",
  "flows": "Signals are sent during comment lifecycle events, data flows from comment or request objects to connected handlers",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward signal definition without dynamic execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's Signal class and defines three signals for comment events: 'comment_will_be_posted', 'comment_was_posted', and 'comment_was_flagged'. The comments explain their intended usage, but no dynamic code, input handling, or data processing occurs here. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of Django signals for comment moderation, with clear documentation. There are no indications of obfuscation, malware, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for Django signals related to comment handling. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The purpose is to facilitate comment moderation workflows safely.",
