  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard Django signals module.\n- No external data handling, input processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code's purpose is to facilitate comment moderation workflows via signals, which is a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude there are no issues, anomalies, or malicious behavior. This aligns with the code, which only defines three signals with clear, documented purposes.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code is minimal, clear, and correctly uses Django's Signal class.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0  \n  These seem appropriate given the code content.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  Since all reports indicate no security issues, malware, or obfuscation, raising the risk score would be unjustified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscated behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, all reports correctly state that the code is benign and standard.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code's purpose is purely declarative, defining signals for comment events.\n- No security vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The detailed comments in the code clarify usage, further reducing ambiguity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as safe. The scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that connected receiver functions handling these signals are secure, but based solely on this snippet, the implementation is safe.",
