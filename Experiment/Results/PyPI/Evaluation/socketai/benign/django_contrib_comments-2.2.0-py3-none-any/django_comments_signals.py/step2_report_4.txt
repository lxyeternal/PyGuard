  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code only defines Django signals related to comment events.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external input handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The purpose of each signal is clearly documented, and they are standard Django constructs.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues in the code. The code matches typical Django signal definitions.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, the risk scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Potential concerns or challenges:**\n- The reports mention that signals are used as triggers and do not process untrusted data directly, which is correct.\n- Since signals are hooks for external functions, if any receiver functions connected to these signals are malicious or poorly written, security could be compromised. However, that risk is outside the scope of this code snippet and cannot be inferred here.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of Django signals for comment moderation.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThis code is benign and functions as intended within a Django application.",
