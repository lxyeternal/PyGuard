  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code defines three Django signals related to comment events.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data processing, input handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose of the signals is clear and standard within Django applications.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only declares signals; it does not emit or process data directly.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports' confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as expected for such a simple signal declaration.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The overall risk scores are 0, justified by the lack of any malicious or insecure behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues are present in the code or the reports.\n- The detailed comments and analysis support that the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current scoring appears accurate and reasonable.\n- Given the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a benign, standard Django signals module for comment moderation events. It poses no security threat and functions as intended within a typical Django project.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.",
