  "purpose": "Define and expose Django signals related to comment lifecycle events such as posting and flagging.",
  "sources": "Code explicitly declares signal objects; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "Signals are used to send notifications within the application; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; signals trigger internal application responses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; code is straightforward signal declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three Django signals for comment-related events. It contains no user input handling, no data processing, no external data fetches, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code's simplicity reduces the risk of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django signals module for comment events with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and functional within its intended scope.",
