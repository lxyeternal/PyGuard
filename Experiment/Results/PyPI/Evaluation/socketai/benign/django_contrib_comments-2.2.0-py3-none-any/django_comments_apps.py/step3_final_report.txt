{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Django application configuration class with static attributes for auto field and app name, serving as boilerplate setup.",
  "sources": "Class definition with static attribute assignments ('default_auto_field' and 'name')",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; static configuration only",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static attribute assignments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Django AppConfig subclass with no input processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, as the code is benign. The only minor inconsistency is a report assigning a 0.1 security risk, which should be lowered to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious features. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores should reflect zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
