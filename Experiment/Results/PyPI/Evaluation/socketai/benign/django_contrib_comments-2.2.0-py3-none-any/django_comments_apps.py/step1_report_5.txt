  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'django_comments' app.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'AppConfig' from 'django.apps'.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines a class with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AppConfig from django.apps and defines a subclass specifying default_auto_field and name attributes. This is standard Django boilerplate for app configuration. No dynamic code execution, no data input handling, no network activity, or other suspicious features are present. The code's structure and content are typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
