  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass with static attributes.\n- No untrusted input, data flows, or malicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static configuration with no dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above; straightforward Django configuration.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) despite no suspicious activity.\n- No malware or obfuscation.\n- The minimal risk score seems to be a conservative default or placeholder.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's benign nature, the risk score could be set to 0 unless a specific context suggests otherwise.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0 for consistency with other reports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others; standard boilerplate code.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are 0, except Report 4's 0.1, which seems unjustified given the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code itself is straightforward and standard; **malware=0**, **obfuscated=0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **0** across all reports, as there are no security concerns.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. The only adjustment needed is to set the securityRisk for Report 4 to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
