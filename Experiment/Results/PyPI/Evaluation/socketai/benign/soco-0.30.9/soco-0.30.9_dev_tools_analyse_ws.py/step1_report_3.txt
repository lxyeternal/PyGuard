{
  "purpose": "The script analyzes Wireshark captures of Sonos traffic, extracts XML content, and optionally displays or saves it.",
  "sources": "Reads input file via rdpcap, extracts packet payloads, and parses XML from packet loads.",
  "sinks": "Writes XML content to files, displays in browser, and outputs to terminal with optional syntax highlighting.",
  "flows": "Packet payloads are extracted and parsed as XML, then possibly saved or displayed. No untrusted data is sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration present. Uses external libraries responsibly. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code processes pcap files, extracts specific payloads, and parses XML content, mainly for analysis. It uses standard libraries and external packages like scapy, lxml, and pygments. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, network exfiltration, or system damage. The only potentially risky behavior is file writing and process invocation for opening browsers, which are common in analysis tools. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious injections are found.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a network analysis tool for Sonos traffic, with no indications of malicious intent or malware. It leverages open-source libraries correctly and performs typical analysis tasks. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
