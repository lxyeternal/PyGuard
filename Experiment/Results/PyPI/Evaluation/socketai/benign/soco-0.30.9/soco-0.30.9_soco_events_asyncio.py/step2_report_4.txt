  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources/Sinks:** The description aligns with the code, focusing on asyncio UPnP event handling, subscription, and notification processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are evident. The only minor point is the route 'notify' with an empty string, which might be unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is legitimate with low security risk is consistent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- securityRisk: 0.2 (low, given the standard network handling)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources/Sinks:** The description matches the code's behavior, including event parsing and network handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or malicious code detected. The event parsing and network setup are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment of a legitimate, low-risk implementation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources/Sinks:** Accurate; the code manages subscriptions and events with standard asyncio patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The socket binding and event parsing are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, low-security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources/Sinks:** Correct; the code sets up an asyncio HTTP server and manages subscriptions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior or secrets. The network handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources/Sinks:** Matches the code's functions for event handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Proper network management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low security risk conclusion is justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a legitimate asyncio-based UPnP event handler for Sonos.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are reasonable given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, standard network handling with no secrets or malicious behavior)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of Sonos UPnP event handling, with no supply chain or security concerns evident.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and their reasoning.",
