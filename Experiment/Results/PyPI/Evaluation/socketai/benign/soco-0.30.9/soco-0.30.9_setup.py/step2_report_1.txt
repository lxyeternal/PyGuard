  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to confirm the presence or absence of issues, and assess the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard setup script for a Python package.\n- It defines a custom test command class `PyTest` that configures pytest to exclude integration tests.\n- The `setup()` function is called with no arguments, indicating a very basic or legacy setup.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are present.\n- **Malware or suspicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is straightforward and readable.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of security issues.\n- Since the code is a standard setup script, this is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a typical setup script, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n> **Malware:** 0  \n> **Obfuscated:** 0  \n> **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and contains no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
