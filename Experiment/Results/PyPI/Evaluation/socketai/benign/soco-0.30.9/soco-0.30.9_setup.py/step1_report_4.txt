{
  "purpose": "This code provides a setup configuration for a Python package, primarily integrating pytest for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import sys`, `from setuptools import setup`, `from setuptools.command.test import test as TestCommand`), and the `setup()` function call at the end.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code only defines a test command class and executes setup.",
  "flows": "Imports and class definition flow into the `setup()` call; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is a standard setup script with pytest integration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom test command `PyTest` for the setup process, allowing pytest to run tests excluding integration tests. It imports standard modules, extends a `TestCommand`, and customizes test execution. The `setup()` function is called without additional parameters, suggesting this is a minimal setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. All code appears to be standard, intended for package testing and distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with pytest integration. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The script is straightforward and appears safe.",
