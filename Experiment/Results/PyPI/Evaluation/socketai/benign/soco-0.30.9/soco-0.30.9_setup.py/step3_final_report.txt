{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package that defines a custom pytest command to exclude integration tests during testing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and setuptools modules; class definition for PyTest that reads test arguments; call to setup() with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(errno) after pytest.main(), which terminates the process based on test results.",
  "flows": "PyTest.run_tests() calls pytest.main() with test_args, then sys.exit() with the return code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard class inheritance; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; setup() called with no arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script configuring pytest to exclude integration tests. It imports standard modules, defines a class customizing test execution, and calls setup() minimally. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations are present. The sys.exit() call is typical for test scripts. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
