{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom test command using pytest.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, setuptools), class definitions, and setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> define class -> call setup() without additional data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The custom test command is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a Python package with a custom pytest command, including a class that modifies test arguments to exclude integration tests. The code uses standard library imports and the setuptools library to facilitate package installation. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The run_tests method imports pytest at runtime, which is normal. Overall, the script appears to be a typical setup script with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply extends the testing command to exclude integration tests. There are no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
