{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom test command using pytest.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, setuptools, setuptools.command.test), class definition, method implementations, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(errno) in run_tests() could influence process termination, but is a standard practice in test scripts.",
  "flows": "Import sys -> define PyTest class -> call setup() -> execute test command -> exit process based on test results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code includes standard testing setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a custom pytest command class. It imports necessary modules, overrides methods for test configuration, and invokes setup(). No suspicious activity, malicious behavior, or malicious code patterns are present. It strictly manages testing procedures and process exit codes. No data leaks, insecure code, or obfuscated patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a custom test command, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used to configure package testing and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
