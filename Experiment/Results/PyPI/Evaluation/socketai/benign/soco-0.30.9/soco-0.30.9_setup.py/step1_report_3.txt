  "purpose": "This script is a setup utility for a Python package, primarily configuring testing options using pytest.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, setuptools, and setuptools.command.test; test arguments defined in finalize_options method.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit call after pytest.main execution, which terminates the process with the pytest result code.",
  "flows": "Imports -> finalize_options sets test arguments -> run_tests calls pytest.main -> sys.exit terminates process based on test results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code comments indicate standard testing setup practices. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom test command class inheriting from setuptools' TestCommand, configuring pytest to exclude integration tests. The finalize_options method sets test arguments, and run_tests executes pytest and exits with the appropriate status. The setup() call is standard for package configuration. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or security risks identified. The code is straightforward and consistent with common Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup utility for running tests in a Python project, with no indications of malicious activity or security concerns. It simply configures and runs pytest for the package.",
