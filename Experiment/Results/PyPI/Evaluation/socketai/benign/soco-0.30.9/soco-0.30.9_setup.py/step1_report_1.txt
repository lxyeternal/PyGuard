{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, facilitating testing via pytest.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, setuptools, and setuptools.command.test; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily configures test commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for package setup and testing. Defines a custom test command class that modifies pytest arguments to exclude integration tests. Overrides run_tests to invoke pytest with the specified arguments. Uses setup() with no arguments, indicating a minimal or legacy setup. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The code is a typical test setup script with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for running tests with pytest. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It is safe and appears solely intended for development/testing purposes.",
