{
  "purpose": "Provides access and management functions for a local network's music library via UPnP, including search, browse, and update operations.",
  "sources": "Method arguments (search_type, search_term, subcategories, etc.), network responses from contentDirectory.Browse and related UPnP calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to UPnP devices, URI constructions for album art and playlist identifiers, XML parsing of device responses.",
  "flows": "Inputs (search terms, IDs, subcategories) are incorporated into UPnP requests; responses are parsed and used to generate SearchResult objects; URI handling updates album art URIs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Proper escaping of user inputs used to mitigate injection risks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard UPnP media library interactions with careful input handling and response parsing. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. Inputs are sanitized with URL escaping, and network interactions follow typical patterns. The code's structure and logic are consistent with legitimate media management functions. Risks are minimal and primarily involve external device responses, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate UPnP media library interface with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs proper input sanitization and standard protocols, resulting in a very low security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1–0.2, justified by potential external response issues but not by the code itself.",
