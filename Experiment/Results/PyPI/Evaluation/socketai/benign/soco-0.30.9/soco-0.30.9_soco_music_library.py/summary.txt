  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate UPnP media library interface with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs proper input sanitization and standard protocols, resulting in a very low security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1–0.2, justified by potential external response issues but not by the code itself."
