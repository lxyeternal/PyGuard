  "purpose": "Provides a simple library to control Sonos speakers, including discovery and exceptions handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core, .discovery, .exceptions), and metadata variables (__author__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or eval-like functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module setup. It imports necessary components, defines metadata, and configures logging. There are no network communications, no input/output operations involving external untrusted data, nor any dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The structure and content align with standard library modules. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard library setup for controlling Sonos speakers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities within this code snippet.",
