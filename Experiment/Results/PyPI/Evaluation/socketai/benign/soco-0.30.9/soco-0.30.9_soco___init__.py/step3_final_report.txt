{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for the SoCo (Sonos Controller) library, importing modules, setting metadata, and configuring logging.",
  "sources": "Import statements for core modules, discovery, and exceptions; setting metadata variables; configuring logging handlers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static setup without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initialization script with imports, metadata, and logging configuration. It contains no network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling involving untrusted sources. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's nature. The reports correctly interpret the code as safe and standard, with high confidence and appropriate scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and justified in their assessments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
