  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily import statements, metadata definitions, and logging configuration.\n   - No data flows, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is standard for a Python package setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments about the absence of malicious activity are justified given the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty based on the code provided.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code does not perform any network communication, data handling, or dynamic execution, the risk is minimal.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious intent or behavior is evident.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - Security risk is 0, as the code does not introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they rely on the code content.\n   - Their conclusions are sound and based on the actual code snippet.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign setup module for a Python library. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
