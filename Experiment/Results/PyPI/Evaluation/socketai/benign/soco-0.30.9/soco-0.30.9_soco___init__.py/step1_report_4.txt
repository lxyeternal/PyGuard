{
  "purpose": "Provide a Python library for controlling Sonos speakers, including discovery and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core, .discovery, .exceptions), metadata variables (__author__, __version__, etc.), and logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no malicious behavior detected. The comments clarify coding practices and versioning but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module header for a Python package, importing necessary submodules, setting package metadata, and configuring logging. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or execution of dynamic code. The structure and comments suggest standard package setup without malicious features or obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package header for the SoCo library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for a Python library setup and contains no malicious or suspicious code.",
