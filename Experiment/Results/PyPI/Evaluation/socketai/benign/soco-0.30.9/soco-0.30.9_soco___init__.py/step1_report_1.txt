  "purpose": "To provide a library for controlling Sonos speakers and facilitate discovery and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from core, discovery, and exceptions modules; module metadata variables (__author__, __version__, __website__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; no network operations, data leaks, or external communications within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No active source-to-sink data flows are present in this code; it mainly defines imports, metadata, and logging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and metadata setup; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules for functionality, sets package metadata, and configures logging. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute untrusted input. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is evident. The code is typical for a Python library's initial setup and does not contain any code injection, backdoors, or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly handles imports, metadata, and logging configuration, all of which are safe.",
