{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python library for controlling Sonos speakers, defining imports, metadata, and logging configuration.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __version__, __website__, __license__), import statements, and logging configuration",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules and metadata variables; no explicit data sinks or external communication points in this fragment",
  "flows": "Imports and metadata variables are set; logging setup is configured; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the module's metadata, imports core components, and configures logging. All components are standard for Python libraries. No external data is read from untrusted sources, and no suspicious code behaviors or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and follows common practices for open-source Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard library setup code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
