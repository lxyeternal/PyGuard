  "purpose": "Configuration for building documentation using Sphinx for the SoCo project.",
  "sources": "Import of soco module, sys.path modifications, and standard configuration variables for Sphinx.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or network operations found.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code is standard configuration and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file. It modifies sys.path to include the parent directory and imports the soco module, likely for version info. All other code is static configuration for Sphinx, with no user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code snippets. The code's purpose is solely to set up documentation build parameters.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Sphinx configuration script with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior present.",
