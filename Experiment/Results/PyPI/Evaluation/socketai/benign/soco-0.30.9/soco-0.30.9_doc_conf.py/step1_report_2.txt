  "purpose": "Configuration for building documentation using Sphinx for the SoCo project",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os, soco), sys.path modifications, soco.__version__ usage",
  "sinks": "No significant sink points that process untrusted data or lead to malicious actions",
  "flows": "Importing soco.__version__ for version info, sys.path insertion for module import paths",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected; standard configuration setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with standard imports, path modifications, and project metadata. The only notable operation is inserting a directory into sys.path and importing soco to access its version. No network activity, data leaks, code execution, or obfuscated code present. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages documentation build settings and imports the project version for metadata.",
