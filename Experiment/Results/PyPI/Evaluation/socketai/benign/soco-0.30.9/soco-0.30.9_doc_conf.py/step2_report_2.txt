  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The code only performs typical setup tasks: importing modules, setting configuration variables, and reading the project version from `soco`.\n- No untrusted data sources, network communication, or sensitive data handling are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The import of `soco` is standard for including project metadata, not suspicious.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms benign purpose, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious intent.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar conclusion: standard setup, no suspicious behavior, no external data or network activity.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same as above, confirms benign configuration with no malicious indicators.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Consistent with prior assessments: no malicious behavior, only static configuration, no untrusted data.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion: benign, standard setup, no suspicious activity.  \n- Confidence: 1.0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on clarity.  \n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely configuration with no external inputs, network activity, or sensitive data, the risk remains effectively zero.\n\n### Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file, used widely in documentation projects.\n- It imports only standard modules and the project module `soco` to retrieve version info.\n- No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no embedded secrets, no network or external data interactions.\n- The presence of `import soco` is normal for project documentation and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the minimal risk associated with importing a third-party module, but overall negligible)\n\n**Overall, this code is benign, with no security concerns.**",
