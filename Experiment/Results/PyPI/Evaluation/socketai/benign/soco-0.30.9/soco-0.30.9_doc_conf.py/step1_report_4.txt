  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation build for the SoCo project.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'os', and 'soco' modules; sets sys.path; reads project version from 'soco.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; no network, file write, or system calls with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from 'soco.__version__' into variables; modifies sys.path; no other data flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no suspicious code structures or unusual behavior. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up configuration parameters for documentation generation, including module importation, path adjustments, and project metadata. The import of 'soco' and the retrieval of its version are standard for documentation purposes. No external data sources, network calls, or file writes based on untrusted input are present. The script does not perform any data processing, system modifications, or potentially harmful operations. The code structure is typical for Sphinx configuration files, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely initializes documentation settings without any suspicious activities.",
