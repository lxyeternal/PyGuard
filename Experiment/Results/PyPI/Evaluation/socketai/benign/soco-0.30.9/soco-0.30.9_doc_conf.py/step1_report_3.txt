  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the SoCo project.",
  "sources": "Import statements: sys, os, soco; Usage of os.path.abspath; soco.__version__ access.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected. The code mainly sets configuration parameters for documentation building.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a project-specific module 'soco' solely for retrieving version info. It sets various configuration options for Sphinx documentation, including extensions, paths, HTML options, and output formats. No user input, network operations, or untrusted data handling is present. The use of 'sys.path.insert' and 'import soco' is typical for project documentation setup. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The code is standard configuration code for documentation generation with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely sets parameters for documentation build and includes no malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
