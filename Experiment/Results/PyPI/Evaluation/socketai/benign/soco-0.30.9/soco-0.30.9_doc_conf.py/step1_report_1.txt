  "purpose": "Configuration for building documentation using Sphinx for the SoCo project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, and soco; reads environment variables for sys.path modifications.",
  "sinks": "None of the code interacts with untrusted data, performs network communication, or manipulates sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. It imports soco, which could contain vulnerabilities, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with setup for documentation generation. It modifies sys.path to include the parent directory and imports soco to access its version info. No external data inputs, network communications, or sensitive operations are present. The code is structured, clear, and typical for documentation setup. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
