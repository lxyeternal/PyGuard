{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the SoCo (Sonos Controller) library.",
  "sources": "The code defines classes and constructors; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages are stored and formatted; no untrusted data is used in critical operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to critical sinks; exception handling is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code only defines exception classes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions used for error handling within the SoCo library. It includes custom exceptions with clear purpose, constructors, and string representations. No input parsing, network communication, or dynamic execution is present. The code does not perform any data manipulation beyond storing and reporting error messages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of super().__init__() without parameters is normal, and attribute access is controlled. Overall, this is a standard exception class implementation with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes for the SoCo library. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and poses no security risks.",
