{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for use within the SoCo library for handling various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__), __str__ methods, attribute access (__getattr__, __setattr__), and potential data passed into exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the exception messages or attributes could be accessed or logged elsewhere; however, this code itself does not perform any network, file, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exceptions with messages and attributes, string conversion (__str__), attribute access, and error handling flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Exception classes are standard and do not perform any external or risky operations.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes inheriting from Exception or object. It includes __init__ methods setting attributes, __str__ methods for string representations, and attribute access overrides. No external data transmission, network operations, or obfuscated/malicious logic present. The use of exception handling and class design is typical for a library module. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes used for error handling in the SoCo library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a benign and conventional component of a Python package.",
