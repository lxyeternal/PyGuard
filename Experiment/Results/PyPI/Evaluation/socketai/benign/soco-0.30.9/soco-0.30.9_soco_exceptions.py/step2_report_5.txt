  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is solely class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data processing, input handling, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The pattern of exception classes and their constructors is standard.\n- The `SoCoFault` class wraps exceptions and raises them upon attribute/item access, which is a known pattern for exception handling and debugging, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No evidence of code injection, dynamic code execution, or external data leaks.\n- No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are identified.\n- The exception classes serve their purpose in error handling without side effects.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close, since there are no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores; they are appropriate.\n- The detailed analysis confirms the code's safety and typical usage pattern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is safe and typical for a Python library's exception handling module.",
