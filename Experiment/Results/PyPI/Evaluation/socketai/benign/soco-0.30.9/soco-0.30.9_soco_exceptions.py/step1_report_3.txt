{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the SoCo (Sonos Controller) library to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes and their constructors, which may be invoked during error handling.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and attributes (e.g., message, error_xml, error_description) could potentially be used for logging or displayed to users.",
  "flows": "Error conditions trigger instantiation of exception objects, which may be caught and processed by higher-level code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. The exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines various exception classes related to the SoCo library. All classes inherit from Python's Exception base class and serve to encapsulate error information. The implementation includes constructors that set attributes based on input parameters, __str__ methods for string representation, and attribute handling. There are no indications of code injection, malicious logic, network operations, or data leaks. No obfuscated or complex code constructs are present. The structure and purpose are typical of error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of exception classes for the SoCo library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any operations that could harm or leak data, nor does it include obfuscated or suspicious code. Overall, the code is safe.",
