{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the SoCo library to handle various error conditions and special cases in UPnP and related operations.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and attribute assignments within exception classes; no external data input or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects and raising them upon errors; no external data flow or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions used for error handling in the SoCo library. It does not include data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve their purpose in error reporting without side effects. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The wrapping class 'SoCoFault' raises stored exceptions on attribute or item access, which is a known pattern for deferred exception handling, not malicious activity. All indicators point to benign, standard code with no security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
