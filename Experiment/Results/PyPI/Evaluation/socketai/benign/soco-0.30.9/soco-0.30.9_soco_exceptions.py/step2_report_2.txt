  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is solely class definitions for exceptions, with no data processing, network operations, or external input handling. The code appears standard and free of anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports uniformly identify the code as standard exception class definitions. They correctly note that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0.0 and a security risk of 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0.0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution, a high risk score would be unjustified. The reports' low scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score of 0.0 across all reports is justified; there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard exception definitions with no suspicious elements.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.0** — No security risk associated with exception class definitions.\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured set of exception classes used in a Python library. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the provided scores and assessments.**",
