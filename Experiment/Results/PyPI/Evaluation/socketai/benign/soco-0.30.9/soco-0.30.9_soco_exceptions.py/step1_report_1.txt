{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and exceptions in the SoCo (Sonos Controller) library.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data; it only defines exception classes and their constructors.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, no untrusted data handling or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears standard for defining exceptions, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions used within the SoCo library. These classes are for error handling and do not process or handle external input directly. The exception classes include constructors and string representations, all typical for Python error handling. There are no code injection points, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The only notable aspect is the 'SoCoFault' class that wraps exceptions and raises them upon attribute or item access; however, this pattern is common for exception handling and does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe and typical for its purpose.",
