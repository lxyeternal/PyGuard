{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the SoCo (Sonos Controller) library, including network, device, and XML parsing errors.",
  "sources": "The code itself is a set of class definitions; no external data input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or could cause security issues within this code.",
  "flows": "Since the code is primarily class definitions, there are no data flows from sources to sinks. The exceptions may be instantiated elsewhere in application code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of class definitions for various custom exceptions used by the SoCo library. It includes an exception hierarchy, with some exceptions tailored for network errors, XML parsing errors, and device state issues. The code adheres to standard Python practices and contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic. No external inputs, outputs, or data manipulation are present that could be exploited or pose security threats. All classes serve to handle error states and do not perform any security-sensitive operations beyond exception management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for the SoCo library, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process external data or execute dangerous operations. The overall security risk is negligible.",
