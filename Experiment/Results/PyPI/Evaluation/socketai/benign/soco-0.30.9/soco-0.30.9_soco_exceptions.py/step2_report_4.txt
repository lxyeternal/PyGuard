  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions used within the SoCo library. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute any code beyond defining classes and their constructors. No data input, output, or external interactions are present. Therefore, there are no issues such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes, with no data processing or external data handling. No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware score: 0.0\n   - Obfuscated score: 0.0\n   - Security risk: 0.0  \n   \n   These are consistent with the code's nature. Given the absence of any malicious or obfuscated code, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since all reports and the code itself indicate no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at zero. There is no justification for elevating the risk score above 0.5, as there are no indicators of security vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0.0. The code does not contain any malicious constructs, such as code that could execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate data, or establish backdoors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not seem to rely on assumptions; they accurately interpret the code's purpose and behavior. The code is straightforward class definitions for error handling, with no suspicious or hidden logic.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0.0**\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and safe. No security risks or malicious behaviors are present.**",
