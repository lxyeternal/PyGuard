{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python module that manages OCR (Optical Character Recognition) related classes and functionality, likely providing deprecated components and importing specific classes for text and region extraction.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility; import from relative package '..common' and '..common.extract_text' for functions and classes",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; only static imports and module initialization",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module function and explicit '__all__' declaration; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily import statements and module setup. It imports future compatibility features, marks the module as deprecated, and defines the public API via __all__. There are no data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. The presence of a deprecation warning indicates maintenance but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module setup with deprecation handling and explicit exports, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
