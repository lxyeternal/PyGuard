{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up imports and module deprecation warnings for OCR-related classes and settings, likely as part of a larger library or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from a relative module: '..common' and '..common.extract_text', which likely provide common functions and OCR components.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions are visible in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are evident; the code mainly handles module setup and deprecation warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses relative imports and deprecation handling in a standard way.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports specific classes and functions from a relative common module, marks the module as deprecated, and defines the exported classes. There are no data manipulations, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. It is a straightforward setup script with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign setup code primarily for module management and backward compatibility. No malicious behavior, no security risks detected, and no anomalies observed.",
