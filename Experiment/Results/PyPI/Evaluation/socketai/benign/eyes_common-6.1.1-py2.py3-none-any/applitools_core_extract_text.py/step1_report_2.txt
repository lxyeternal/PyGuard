{
  "purpose": "This module appears to handle OCR-related classes or functions, possibly related to text extraction or image processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from the parent package's common module, specifically deprecated and extract_text submodule.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines an export list; there are no data flows or execution flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The module uses a deprecated decorator, which may suggest outdated or unused code but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions, marks itself as deprecated, and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of '__future__' imports indicates compatibility considerations. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It mainly manages imports and module deprecation status.",
