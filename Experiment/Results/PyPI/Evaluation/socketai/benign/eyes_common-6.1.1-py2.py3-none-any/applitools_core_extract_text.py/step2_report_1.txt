  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as import/setup modules related to OCR and text regions.\n- Common themes: use of __future__ imports, relative imports from common modules, deprecation notices, and defining __all__.\n- No evidence of dynamic data handling, external network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward setup module, primarily for managing imports and deprecation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n- The code is minimal and mainly involves import statements, deprecation, and export definitions.\n- No runtime or dynamic code, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign setup code.\n- The mention of deprecated functions is accurate but not inherently problematic.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which aligns with minimal or no security risk.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The second report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1; perhaps it could be 0, given no actual security concern.\n- The other reports are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5.\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is reasonable for very minor concerns like deprecation notices or maintenance practices.\n- **No higher scores needed** since there's no indication of malicious or security-threatening behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports' malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports assume that deprecation notices or relative imports could be suspicious, but these are standard practices.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unfounded; the code is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable assignments.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the code and reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or context that might reveal hidden behaviors, but based on this snippet alone, the code is safe.",
