  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple module that imports future features and some internal modules, marks itself as deprecated, and defines an `__all__` list for exports.\n- No dynamic code, no external data sources, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is consistent across reports, with minor variations in confidence and security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; standard import and deprecation setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. \n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly higher but still minimal; the report mentions no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n\n**Note:** The slight security risk score is acceptable given the absence of any malicious activity; deprecation might be considered a minor risk if misused, but not here.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Same observations as above, with a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n\n**No issues here.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Same as above, with high confidence and no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is acceptable given the simplicity.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All zero or very close to zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the uniformity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious patterns, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0 or very close to zero, e.g., 0.0 or 0.1, primarily due to deprecation notices, which are maintenance concerns rather than security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign, standard module setup, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
