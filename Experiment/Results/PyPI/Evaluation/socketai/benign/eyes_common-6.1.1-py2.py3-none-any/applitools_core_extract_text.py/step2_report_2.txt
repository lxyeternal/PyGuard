  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall security posture.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code consists of:\n  - `__future__` imports for compatibility.\n  - Relative imports from `..common` and `..common.extract_text`.\n  - Usage of `deprecated.module(__name__)`.\n  - Definition of `__all__` with class names as strings.\n\n- **Are there any security issues or malicious behaviors?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward module setup, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, primarily setup and import statements.\n- They note the use of deprecated functions, which is not malicious but indicates outdated code.\n- No report mentions any obfuscation, dynamic code, or data flow issues, which aligns with the code.\n\n**Potential oversight:**  \n- The reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is accurate given the code snippet.  \n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0 or very low, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal risk, which is reasonable.\n\n**Any unreasonable scores?**  \nNo. The scores align with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Justify any high risk scores (>0.5)**  \n- None of the reports assign high risk scores.  \n- The highest risk score is 0.1, justified by deprecation notices, which are not security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Assessment**\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- The code is purely import/setup with no malicious activity.  \n- **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present.  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Given the code's benign nature, minimal risk.  \n- **Estimated risk score: 0**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard module setup with deprecation handling, imports, and export definitions. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context in the larger codebase, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
