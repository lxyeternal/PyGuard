{
  "purpose": "The code imports future features and modules related to OCR and text regions, then marks the module as deprecated and defines exportable classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and relative imports from common modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module function, but this is not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard import and module deprecation setup. It imports features for compatibility (__future__), and modules related to OCR and text regions. The use of relative imports and deprecation indicates maintenance or versioning practices but does not suggest malicious intent. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase managing OCR-related functionalities, with deprecation notice for module lifecycle management.",
