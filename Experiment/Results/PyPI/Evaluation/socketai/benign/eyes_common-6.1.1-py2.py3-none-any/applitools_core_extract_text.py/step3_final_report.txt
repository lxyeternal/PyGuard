  "purpose": "Module setup for OCR and text region classes, managing imports, deprecation, and exports.",
  "sources": "__future__ import statements, relative imports from common modules, deprecation function call",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static import and setup code",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module function, but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script, importing future features, internal modules, marking itself as deprecated, and defining __all__ for exports. There are no dynamic elements, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. The deprecation notice indicates outdated practices but is not malicious. The absence of any suspicious patterns or malicious code suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
