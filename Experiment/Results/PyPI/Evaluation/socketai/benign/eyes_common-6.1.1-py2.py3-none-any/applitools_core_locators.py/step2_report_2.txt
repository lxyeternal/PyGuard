  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The **original code** performs only import statements, deprecation marking, and setting `__all__`.  \n- There are **no data flows**, **no untrusted input/output**, **no dynamic code execution**, **no hardcoded secrets**, and **no obfuscation**.  \n- The code is straightforward, typical of module setup, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as import/setup with deprecation warning, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *confidence:* 1 — appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as Report 1, consistent and correct.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *confidence:* 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard module setup with deprecation, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *confidence:* 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard module setup, no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *confidence:* 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 — justified.  \n  - *confidence:* 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- All reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately score the code as benign with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty, which is justified given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**, given the code clarity.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should stay at **0**, as the code performs standard setup without vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Accurate |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Accurate |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Accurate |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Accurate |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Accurate |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.**",
