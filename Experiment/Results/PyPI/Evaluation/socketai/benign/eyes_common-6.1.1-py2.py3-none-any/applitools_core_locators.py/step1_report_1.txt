{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up imports and deprecation handling for two classes, VisualLocator and VisualLocatorSettings, likely part of a larger library or framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and relative imports from parent modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs import and deprecation setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed. Usage of deprecated module warning is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then imports specific classes and a deprecation function from internal modules. It marks the module as deprecated, and defines the exported names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a normal module setup with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup with deprecation warning and no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard import and export definitions without handling untrusted data or executing any potentially harmful operations.",
