{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module imports and deprecation warnings for a package, specifically exposing VisualLocator and VisualLocatorSettings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules, including deprecated module handling and locators.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports, which is common in package internals, not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future compatibility features and modules from internal relative paths, then marks the module as deprecated. It also defines __all__ for exports. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The purpose is solely to prepare and expose specific classes for external use, with deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard module setup code with deprecation warnings, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
