{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module deprecation and define exports for VisualLocator and VisualLocatorSettings classes or functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules, specifically '..common' and '..common.locators'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing or transmission present.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs module deprecation and exports; no anomalies or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and functions, marks the module as deprecated, and defines the module's exports. It does not include any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or hidden behavior. The use of relative imports is typical in package code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with deprecation and export declarations. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
