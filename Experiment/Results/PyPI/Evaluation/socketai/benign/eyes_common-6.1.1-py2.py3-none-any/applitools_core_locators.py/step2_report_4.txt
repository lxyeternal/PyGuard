  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code performs standard import statements, including future features for compatibility.\n- It imports specific classes and a deprecation utility from internal modules.\n- It marks the module as deprecated.\n- It defines `__all__` with class names for export.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- No data handling, untrusted input, or output functions.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- Use of relative imports is typical in package internal code.\n- The deprecation warning is a standard practice, not suspicious.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1-5:**  \nAll reports conclude the code is standard module setup with no malicious activity, no suspicious logic, and no security risks. They assign:\n- Confidence: 1 (high)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Are these assessments reasonable?**  \nYes. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring considerations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is benign, the risk score should be 0.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**  \nAll reports correctly assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a typical module setup with deprecation handling, no malicious or risky behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk. The reports are justified, and the scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
