  "purpose": "This code imports modules and marks the current module as deprecated, setting up some class exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, and relative imports from common and locators modules.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily performs setup and deprecation marking.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated marking, but no malicious or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports classes from neighboring modules, and marks the module as deprecated. The __all__ variable is set with class names for export. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic execution, and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup with deprecation marking and class exports, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
