  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as standard module setup: importing future features, relative imports from internal modules, marking the module as deprecated, and defining `__all__`.\n- No report identifies any untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package's internal setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is simple, and the reports correctly identify that it does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code as provided.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as boilerplate setup.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the summaries.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Malware score is 0, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- The code's purpose is benign, related to deprecation warnings and class exports.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all analyses are accurate.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security issues.\n- Relative imports are standard in package internals and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, my own estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical module setup with no security concerns. All reports are consistent and accurate. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways continue to monitor for dynamic behaviors or external interactions in larger codebases, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
