  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the details provided and the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `absolute_import`, `division`, `print_function`, `unicode_literals` from `__future__`.\n- Imports `deprecated` from `..common`.\n- Imports `VisualLocator`, `VisualLocatorSettings` from `..common.locators`.\n- Calls `deprecated.module(__name__)` to mark the module as deprecated.\n- Defines `__all__` with `\"VisualLocator\"` and `\"VisualLocatorSettings\"`.\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward module setup, involving compatibility imports, deprecation marking, and defining exports.\n- No data processing, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is consistent across all reports.\n- No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code performs standard module setup tasks.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- None detected. The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Justification:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n- The deprecation warning is a common practice, not suspicious.\n- Importing from relative modules is typical in package internals.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is standard boilerplate for a Python package module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
