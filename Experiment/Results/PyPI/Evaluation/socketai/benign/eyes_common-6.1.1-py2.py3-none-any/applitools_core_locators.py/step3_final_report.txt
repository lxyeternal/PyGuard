{
  "purpose": "Module setup including compatibility imports, deprecation marking, and export definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, internal modules (__common__, __common.locators).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward import and assignment statements without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import statements for compatibility, imports classes and deprecation utility, marks the module as deprecated, and defines __all__ for exports. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present. The code is typical boilerplate for a Python package module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior detected. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with high confidence. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
