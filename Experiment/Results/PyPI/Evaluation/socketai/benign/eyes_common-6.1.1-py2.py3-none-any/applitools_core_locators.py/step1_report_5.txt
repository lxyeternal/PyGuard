{
  "purpose": "This code sets up module imports and deprecation warnings for VisualLocator and VisualLocatorSettings classes, likely part of a larger library or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, relative imports from common modules",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports do not process or pass untrusted data; they simply include modules and set deprecation warnings",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated elements, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports future compatibility features and modules from relative paths, then marks the module as deprecated. It defines the __all__ variable for exports. All actions are standard for Python module setup. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be boilerplate setup code for a Python module, involving deprecation and exports, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
