  "purpose": "Extend the package's search path for namespace package compatibility",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__import__' to dynamically access it; '__path__' and '__name__' are predefined module attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leakage",
  "flows": "The code modifies '__path__' by extending it with additional paths via 'pkgutil.extend_path', which is a standard operation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a common namespace package extension without obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically and extends the current module's '__path__' attribute to support namespace packaging. This is a standard practice in Python to support packages spread across multiple directories. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The use of '__import__' and 'extend_path' is typical in namespace packages. No hidden or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign and standard implementation for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
