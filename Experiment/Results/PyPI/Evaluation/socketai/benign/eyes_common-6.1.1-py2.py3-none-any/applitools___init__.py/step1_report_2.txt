{
  "purpose": "Extending the module's __path__ for package resource discovery using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses '__path__' and '__name__' variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil', then calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' to modify the module's __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package resource extension; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' using the __import__ function, then extends the __path__ variable with 'pkgutil.extend_path', a common pattern for namespace packages. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or malicious actions. The usage is typical in Python packages for resource management and namespace extension.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace extension operation without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a normal part of Python package management.",
