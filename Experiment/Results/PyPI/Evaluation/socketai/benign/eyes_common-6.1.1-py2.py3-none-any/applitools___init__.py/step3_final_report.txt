  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and use of __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path with __path__ and __name__ -> assign result to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a minimal, standard pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Python namespace package support, using a standard pattern. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The use of __import__ and extend_path is typical and safe. The code does not involve external data, network activity, or sensitive operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a canonical, benign pattern for namespace package support with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate low risk scores. No adjustments are necessary.",
