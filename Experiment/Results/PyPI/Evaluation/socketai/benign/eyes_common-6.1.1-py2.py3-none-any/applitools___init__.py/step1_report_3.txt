  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' module and accessing __path__ and __name__ variables",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> extension of __path__ variable with __name__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a standard namespace package extension",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path to modify the __path__ variable for namespace package support. Both __path__ and __name__ are standard special variables in Python packages. The operation is typical for supporting namespace packages and does not involve data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, and no suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a legitimate function for namespace package support with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
