{
  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for package namespace support",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __import__ to load it, then calls extend_path() with __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or malicious actions occur",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path(__path__, __name__) -> modifies __path__ for namespace package support",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard namespace package support pattern; no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically using __import__, then extends the __path__ variable for namespace package functionality. This is a common practice in Python to support PEP 420 namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a specific, legitimate purpose in package structure handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace package support and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
