{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package resource discovery across multiple locations",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path with __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil', call extend_path to modify __path__",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard pattern for namespace packages, no malicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the package's __path__ variable using 'extend_path'. This is a common pattern for namespace packages in Python, allowing multiple directories to contribute to the same package namespace. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any suspicious or obfuscated elements. It does not read external data, execute untrusted code, or contain hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace package extension and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
