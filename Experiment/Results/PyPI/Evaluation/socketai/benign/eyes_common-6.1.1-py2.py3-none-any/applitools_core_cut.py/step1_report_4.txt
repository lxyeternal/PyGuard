{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module imports and mark the module as deprecated, possibly as part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and relative imports from parent packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data flows or external interactions occur in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes module-level properties.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module marking; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports specific components from a relative path, and marks the module as deprecated. It sets the __all__ variable with a list of class names as strings. No external data handling, user input, or suspicious code elements are present. The deprecation notice is a common practice in libraries to signal upcoming removal or change.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with deprecation marking and no malicious or security concerns identified. It appears to be a harmless part of a larger package.",
