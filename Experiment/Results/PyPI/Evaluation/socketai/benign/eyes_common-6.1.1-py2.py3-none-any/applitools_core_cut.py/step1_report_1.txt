{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that imports certain classes and marks itself as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and relative imports from '..common' modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just module setup and deprecation call",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports and deprecation marker; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python features: future imports for compatibility, relative imports for internal modules, and a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It simply sets up the module's public API and marks it as deprecated, which is typical in maintained packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, normal for a Python module, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
