{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that re-exports classes related to data processing or manipulation, likely for use in larger data pipeline or machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, and imports from a local common module, specifically deprecated functions and cut providers.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks; no untrusted data output or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input or external systems; only static imports and module setup.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the use of deprecated module warning, which is standard for deprecation notices; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then imports specific classes from a relative module path. It marks the module as deprecated using a provided function. The __all__ variable is set to expose specific classes for external use. No data processing, user input, or system modifications are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, focused on module setup and deprecation warning, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with deprecation marking and re-exporting of classes. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious data flow, or security risk evident. The overall assessment indicates safe, standard module code.",
