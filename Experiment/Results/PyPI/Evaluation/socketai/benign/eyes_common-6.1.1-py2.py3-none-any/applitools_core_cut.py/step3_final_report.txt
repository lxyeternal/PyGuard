{
  "purpose": "This module imports future features for compatibility, imports deprecation utilities and specific classes from a relative common module, marks itself as deprecated, and defines its public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and relative modules within ..common",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external network activity or data leakage points",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; module setup only",
  "anomalies": "__all__ is assigned a tuple of strings without brackets, which is syntactically valid but unconventional; no malicious code or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports, marks the module as deprecated, and sets __all__ to a tuple of class names. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The only minor issue is the unconventional assignment of __all__, which could lead to unintended attribute exposure but does not constitute a security risk. No data flows or external interactions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only concern is the unconventional __all__ assignment, which is not malicious but could be improved for clarity. Overall, the module is safe and straightforward.",
