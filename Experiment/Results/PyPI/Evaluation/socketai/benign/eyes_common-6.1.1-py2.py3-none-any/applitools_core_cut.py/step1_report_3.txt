{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules and functions, marks the module as deprecated, and defines the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and relative imports from ..common and ..common.cut",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no network or file I/O",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets up module metadata",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated.module indicates the module is marked as deprecated, but this is not malicious; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports future compatibility features, imports specific components from a relative module, marks the module as deprecated, and declares the public API. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving primarily to set up a module with deprecated status and public API exports. No malicious behavior or security concerns are detected.",
