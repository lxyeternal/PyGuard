{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports certain classes and functions from other modules and marks itself as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and relative imports from ..common and ..common.cut",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and deprecation marking",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated.module() indicates deprecation handling but no malicious activity; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code uses future imports for compatibility, imports specific classes and functions, and marks the module as deprecated. The __all__ variable is assigned a string instead of a list, which is syntactically valid but unconventional; it may lead to unintended exposure of attributes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. The code is minimal, focusing on module setup and deprecation notification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with deprecation marking, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
