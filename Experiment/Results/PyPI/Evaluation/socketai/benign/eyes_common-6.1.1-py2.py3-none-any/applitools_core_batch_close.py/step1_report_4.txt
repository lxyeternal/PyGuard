  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module exports and mark the module as deprecated.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own name (__name__) for deprecation and imports from internal package modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves marking the current module as deprecated, with no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard import and deprecation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports deprecation utilities and module components, marks the module as deprecated, and defines the exported names. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. No secret or sensitive data handling, no external network activity, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard module setup with deprecation marking and exports. No malicious or security issues detected.",
