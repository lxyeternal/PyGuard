  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module that imports future features, imports a deprecation utility and a class, marks itself as deprecated, and exports the class.\n   - The code does not contain any dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present in the code snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The only minor point is that the reports focus heavily on the benign nature, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is benign, no justification exists for higher risk scores.\n   - The current scores of 0 or very low are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code structure.\n   - No exaggerated claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard module setup for deprecation and class export. It does not perform any risky or malicious operations. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nI agree with the current scores. No adjustments are necessary. The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.",
