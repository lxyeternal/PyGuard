  "purpose": "To import and expose the BatchClose class and mark the module as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and relative imports from common modules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; only module initialization and deprecation marking.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module marking; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module imports, marks the module as deprecated, and defines an export. There are no input sources, sinks, or data flows indicating malicious activity. The use of __future__ imports is standard for compatibility. Relative imports are typical in package code. No hidden or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with deprecation marking and no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
