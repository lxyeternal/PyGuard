  "purpose": "Module setup and deprecation warning for BatchClose class",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and relative imports of common modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mostly module setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module warning; no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports future compatibility features, then imports a deprecated decorator and a class from a relative module. It issues a deprecation warning for the module and defines __all__ with one class. No data manipulation, external network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code primarily serves as a module interface setup with deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard module initialization with deprecation handling and no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
