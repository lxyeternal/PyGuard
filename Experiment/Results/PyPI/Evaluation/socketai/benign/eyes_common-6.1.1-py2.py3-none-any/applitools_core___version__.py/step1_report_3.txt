{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module metadata and deprecation warnings, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code imports standard future features and a local common module (__version__, deprecated). It also calls a deprecation function on the current module name.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The only flow is calling 'deprecated.module(__name__)', which is a function call intended to issue a deprecation warning for the module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is minimal and standard for managing deprecation warnings and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports features for compatibility, imports version info and a deprecation handler, marks the module as deprecated, and defines exported symbols. No external inputs, no data leaks, no suspicious code execution. The pattern is common in open-source projects for maintaining backward compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as boilerplate for deprecation management. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
