{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package module that imports future compatibility features, and imports version and deprecation utilities from a relative module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules '..common', including '__version__' and 'deprecated'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module to the current namespace, and the 'deprecated.module' function is called, potentially marking this module as deprecated.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The usage of relative imports is standard in package modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports version and deprecation utilities, and marks the module as deprecated. It defines '__all__' for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No data leaks, no external network calls, and no insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign module setup with deprecation marking and future import statements. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
