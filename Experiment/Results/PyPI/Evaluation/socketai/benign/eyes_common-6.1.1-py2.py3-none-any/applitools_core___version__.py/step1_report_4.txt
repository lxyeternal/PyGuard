{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up module metadata and deprecation handling for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the parent package (..common) and calls a deprecated function with the current module's name.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any actions based on external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is present; the code only imports and calls functions, which are static actions.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a deprecation mechanism and the inclusion of __future__ imports are standard practices; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future statements for compatibility, then imports __version__ and a deprecated function from a local module. It marks the current module as deprecated and defines __all__ with __version__, indicating module metadata setup. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic execution is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python package patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with deprecation handling; there are no malicious behaviors or security concerns identified.",
