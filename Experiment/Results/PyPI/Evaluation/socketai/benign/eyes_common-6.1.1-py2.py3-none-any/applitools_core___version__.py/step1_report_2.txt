{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up module metadata and deprecation handling, primarily for documentation and version control purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports future features for compatibility and imports from a local 'common' module (__version__ and deprecated).",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "The use of deprecated module handling could be part of ongoing maintenance, but nothing suspicious is evident. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses future imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. It imports version information and a deprecation utility from a local module, then marks the current module as deprecated. It defines the public interface to include only the version variable. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code appears standard for managing module lifecycle and compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard module setup for versioning and deprecation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
