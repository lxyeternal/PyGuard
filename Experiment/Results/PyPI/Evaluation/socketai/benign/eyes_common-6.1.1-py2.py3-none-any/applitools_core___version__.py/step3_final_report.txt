  "purpose": "Module setup for versioning and deprecation handling in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, relative import from ..common, call to deprecated.module(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and deprecation call are static; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard boilerplate code with no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only import operations, a deprecation warning setup, and defining __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, external inputs, or network activity. The use of deprecated.module(__name__) is a common pattern to mark modules as deprecated. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the code aligns with best practices for module maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for managing deprecation and versioning in a Python module. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
