{
  "purpose": "This code primarily imports modules and functions from a relative package structure, deprecates the module, and defines __all__ for exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads from __future__ for compatibility features, relative imports from internal modules, and calls deprecated.module(__name__).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code mainly involves importing and deprecating modules, and setting exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of relative imports and deprecation warnings are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various internal modules and functions, marks the current module as deprecated, and sets the __all__ variable for export control. It does not execute any untrusted input handling, network actions, or data leaks. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with import statements, deprecation marking, and export definitions. It appears benign and does not contain malware or security risks.",
