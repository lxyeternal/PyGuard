{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that imports various modules and functions related to visual testing or image analysis, and sets up deprecated module handling and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (..common.*) and deprecation module",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or sensitive data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; the code is primarily module imports and exports with no dynamic execution or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements from relative modules, a deprecation call, and an export tuple (__all__). It does not perform any input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The imports are static and serve to organize the package's API. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles module imports and exports, with no suspicious or malicious activity present.",
