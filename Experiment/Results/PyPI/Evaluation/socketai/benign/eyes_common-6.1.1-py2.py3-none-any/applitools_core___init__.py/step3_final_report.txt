{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an API aggregator, importing various components from internal packages and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal relative modules, including deprecated, batch_close, cut, extract_text, feature, fluent, locators, triggers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and the setting of __all__ do not involve data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal components, marks itself as deprecated, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or similar module. No suspicious or malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The deprecation call is standard practice. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. No further action or concern is necessary.",
