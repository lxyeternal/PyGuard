{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package providing various utilities and abstractions for visual testing or image processing, including region definitions, triggers, and feature extraction.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing modules from a relative package structure, notably common submodules such as batch_close, cut, extract_text, feature, fluent, locators, and triggers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations; the code mainly defines imports, module deprecation, and __all__ exports.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly shown, as this code does not process input or perform runtime data manipulation; it primarily sets up module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are present. The code structure is standard for a module defining public API exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple components from a relative package, marks the module as deprecated, and defines __all__ for exported symbols. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or runtime data processing. The absence of dynamic code execution, untrusted data handling, or suspicious patterns indicates typical module setup code. The module appears to serve as an interface or API for other code that uses these imported components. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with imports and exports for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or handle untrusted data and is structurally normal for its purpose.",
