{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's module initialization, primarily importing and deprecating certain features.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: __future__, ..common, and ..common.feature",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources to sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module warning; no malicious behavior or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code uses future imports for compatibility, imports a deprecated decorator, and marks the module as deprecated. It sets the __all__ variable to expose 'Feature'. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears standard for package initialization and deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly managing module deprecation and exports with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
