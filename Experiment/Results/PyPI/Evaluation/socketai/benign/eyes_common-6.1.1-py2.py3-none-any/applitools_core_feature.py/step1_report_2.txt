{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that imports and exposes a 'Feature' class, while marking the module as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules '..common' and '..common.feature', and the 'deprecated.module' call.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing deprecated functionality and exposing the 'Feature' class, with no data or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports and a deprecation warning. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then imports 'deprecated' and 'Feature' from relative modules. It calls 'deprecated.module' to mark the current module as deprecated. It defines '__all__' to expose 'Feature'. No input handling, network operations, or data manipulation occur. The code mainly manages module metadata and deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless module setup with deprecation handling and import statements. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
