{
  "purpose": "This code handles module deprecation and exports a Feature class, primarily for compatibility and API management.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from ..common and ..common.feature, and the deprecated.module() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network operations, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and the deprecated module call establish module setup; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports and deprecation warning are standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing future features for compatibility, marking the module as deprecated, and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is to manage deprecation and expose the Feature class, with no input/output or untrusted data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for module setup and deprecation handling, with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
