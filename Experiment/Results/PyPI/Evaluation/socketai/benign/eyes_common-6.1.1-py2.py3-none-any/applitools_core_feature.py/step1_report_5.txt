  "purpose": "This module imports and re-exports the Feature class while marking the module as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__, relative imports of common modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated module marking; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly contains import statements, a deprecation marker, and an export declaration. There are no dynamic executions, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The use of relative imports and deprecation is standard practice in Python code maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with deprecation notice and no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase managing feature exports.",
