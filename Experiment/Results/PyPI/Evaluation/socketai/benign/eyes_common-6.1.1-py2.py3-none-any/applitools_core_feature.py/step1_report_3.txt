{
  "purpose": "This code is primarily for importing and deprecating a module, likely as part of a larger package to manage features and handle deprecated modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads module information (__name__) and imports from relative modules ('..common', '..common.feature').",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, marking the current module as deprecated, and defining __all__ for exports. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future statements to ensure compatibility across Python versions, then imports a 'deprecated' utility and a 'Feature' class from a relative module path. It marks the module as deprecated via 'deprecated.module(__name__)' and sets __all__ for module exports. The structure and content are typical for maintaining backward compatibility and code deprecation notices. No malicious or suspicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for managing deprecation and module exports without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
