{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module deprecation warnings and exports a 'Feature' class for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own namespace for imports and the __name__ attribute for deprecation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no input/output operations or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs import statements and module configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module warning indicates maintenance; no signs of malicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports a deprecation utility, and marks the current module as deprecated. It also defines the public API with __all__. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows, and no suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for managing deprecation warnings and module exports. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
