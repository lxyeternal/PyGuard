  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the original code.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the issues are present in the code**\n\n- The original code:\n  ```python\n  from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals\n\n  from ..common import deprecated\n  from ..common.feature import Feature\n\n  deprecated.module(__name__)\n  __all__ = (\"Feature\",)\n  ```\n- The code performs:\n  - Future imports for compatibility\n  - Relative imports from `..common` and `..common.feature`\n  - Calls `deprecated.module(__name__)` to mark the module as deprecated\n  - Sets `__all__` to expose `Feature`\n\n**Findings:**\n- No data flows, sinks, or untrusted data handling\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or input/output\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and primarily handles deprecation and exports.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly state that the code is standard, with no malicious or security issues.\n- They do not overstate the purpose or suggest any vulnerabilities.\n\n**No significant errors or flaws are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- Most reports assign:\n  - `confidence` around 0.9 to 1.0\n  - `malware` score of 0\n  - `securityRisk` of 0\n  - `obfuscated` of 0\n\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` as 0, and the code is straightforward, there is no justification for higher scores.\n- The highest confidence is around 1.0, which is appropriate.\n\n**No adjustment needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The use of relative imports and deprecation warnings is standard practice.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Malware score remains at 0.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All claims about the code being harmless are accurate.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is based on code content.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency in scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No contradictions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is purely for module setup, deprecation, and export.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware: 0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0**  \n**Risk: 0**",
