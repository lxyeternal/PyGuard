{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a part of a larger package, likely providing triggers related to mouse and text events.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility and from within the package's common modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "Imports do not lead to data flow or processing in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The use of deprecated.module(__name__) suggests maintenance or transitional code, but no malicious or suspicious patterns are evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports compatibility features and specific trigger classes from within the package. It marks the module as deprecated and defines exports for triggers. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The use of relative imports and deprecation hints at ongoing development or refactoring but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It mainly handles module deprecation and exports, with no suspicious patterns.",
