{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific components from a common library and marks the module as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ (standard library), relative imports from '..common' and '..common.triggers'",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only performs imports and deprecation marking",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module marking; no malicious anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports future compatibility features and specific components from a common library, then marks the module as deprecated. The __all__ declaration is a string, which is unusual but not malicious; typically __all__ should be a list. No other suspicious code, data handling, or potential malicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or unsafe features suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that manages imports and deprecation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of string in __all__ is unconventional but harmless.",
