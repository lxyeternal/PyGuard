  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Code Overview:**\n\nThe code is a simple module that:\n\n- Imports future compatibility features.\n- Imports `deprecated` and trigger classes from relative modules.\n- Calls `deprecated.module(__name__)` to mark itself as deprecated.\n- Defines `__all__` as a string containing `\"MouseTrigger\", \"TextTrigger\"`.\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data.\n- No dynamic or unsafe code.\n- Use of relative imports is typical in package code.\n- The `__all__` variable is assigned a string, which is unconventional; normally, it should be a list or tuple.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Import components, mark as deprecated.\n- **Findings:** No malicious anomalies; `__all__` as string is unusual but harmless.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above; part of larger package.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns; deprecation indicated.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, just code structure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Set up deprecation, import triggers.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; `__all__` as string is unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly elevated due to the unconventional `__all__` assignment)\n\n**Justification for risk score:** Since the code doesn't execute any untrusted data or external calls, and only imports and deprecation, the low risk score is appropriate. The only concern is the `__all__` being a string, which could cause import issues but not security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar module setup.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; use of deprecated module function.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Setup deprecation and exports.\n- **Findings:** Minor issue with `__all__` being a string; no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- The main anomaly is the `__all__` assignment as a string, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable, especially with malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 for all reports — consistent with the code.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, primarily due to the unconventional `__all__` assignment. Some reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n**Overall:** The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the unconventional `__all__` assignment, which could cause issues but not security risks)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only minor concern is the `__all__` being a string instead of a list, which should be corrected for proper module behavior but does not pose security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0; set risk at around 0.1 to reflect the minor anomaly.",
