{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module deprecation and imports specific trigger classes from a relative package, likely for handling input events such as mouse and text triggers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: '..common' and '..common.triggers'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module indication; no malicious or suspicious code structures. The __all__ assignment is a string rather than a list, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future compatibility features, marks the module as deprecated, and defines export variables. The use of relative imports is typical in package structures. The __all__ variable is assigned a string, which is unconventional (it should be a list), but does not pose security risks. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module setup with deprecation notice and imports; there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The only anomaly is the __all__ assignment being a string instead of a list, which may cause import issues but not security concerns.",
