  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports certain functionalities and marks itself as deprecated.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, relative imports from common modules",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily imports and deprecation warning",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module declaration, but no malicious or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code uses __future__ imports for compatibility, imports modules from relative paths, and marks the module as deprecated. It exports specific names. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code structure is typical for a module setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module with deprecation handling and standard imports. No malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
