  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the original code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, involving imports, deprecation marking, and exports.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified in any report.\n- The only noted anomaly is the use of a string in `__all__` instead of a list, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious patterns suggest a very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code only performs imports and deprecation marking. No issues or malicious activity are present.\n\n- **Errors or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent. They note the unconventional use of `__all__` as a string, which could cause import issues but isn't malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n  - **SecurityRisk:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1 due to the `__all__` string, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, **malware should remain at 0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation present; **0** is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code only imports modules, marks deprecation, and exports names, **risk should be very low, close to 0**. The only minor concern is the `__all__` being a string, which could cause issues but not security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score | Justification |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**             | No malicious activity observed. The code is static and benign. |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**             | No obfuscation or code hiding techniques used. |\n| **Risk**          | **0.1**           | Very low risk due to unconventional `__all__` assignment, but not security-threatening. |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only anomaly is the use of a string in `__all__`, which is a minor mistake but not malicious.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are generally reasonable, but I recommend keeping malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk at 0.1 to reflect the minor anomaly.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual behavior and the analysis provided.",
