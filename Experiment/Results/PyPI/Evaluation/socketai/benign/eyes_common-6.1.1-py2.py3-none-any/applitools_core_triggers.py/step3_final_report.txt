  "purpose": "Import components, mark module as deprecated, and define exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, relative imports of deprecated and trigger classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static imports and deprecation call.",
  "anomalies": "The __all__ variable is assigned a string instead of a list or tuple, which is unconventional and may cause import issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports future compatibility features and other components, marks itself as deprecated, and defines __all__ as a string. There are no data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The only anomaly is the __all__ assignment, which is a coding style mistake but not malicious. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) due to the __all__ issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is the unconventional __all__ assignment, which does not pose security risks but should be corrected for proper module behavior. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe, with scores reflecting minimal risk.",
