{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module deprecation and exports certain trigger classes for import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future features, local relative imports from '..common' and '..common.triggers'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external calls.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks identified in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated module function; no other anomalies detected. The __all__ assignment should be a list or tuple, but is a string which is potentially a typo or mistake.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, imports a 'deprecated' function and two classes from local modules, marks the module as deprecated, and sets __all__ to export specific names. The use of a string in __all__ is unusual; typically, it should be a list or tuple, which might cause issues, but it isn't malicious. No external data, environment variables, or sensitive info are accessed or manipulated. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module setup code with a minor issue in __all__ assignment. It does not contain malware or security risks, and there is no suspicious behavior detected.",
