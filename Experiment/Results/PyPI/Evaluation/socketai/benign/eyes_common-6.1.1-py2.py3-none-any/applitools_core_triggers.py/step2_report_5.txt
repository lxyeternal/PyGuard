  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; code only imports modules and marks deprecation. The __all__ is a string, which is unconventional but harmless.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1 (possibly overestimated since no security issues). The confidence is high (1).\n- **Assessment:** The high risk score seems unjustified; this is a benign module. The __all__ being a string is a coding mistake but not a security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with no malicious activity; deprecation and imports only.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 (again possibly overestimating). Confidence is 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues; the risk score could be lowered slightly, but overall consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—imports, deprecation, no malicious activity. The __all__ is a string, which is unconventional.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (a very low security risk). Confidence is 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is appropriate; no malware, just a minor coding anomaly.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign code; no malicious behavior. __all__ as a string is again noted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 (no security risk). Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly low risk; the __all__ issue is a coding mistake but not security-related.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; no malicious activity, only deprecation and imports. __all__ as a string.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate low risk; no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The scores are consistently zero.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Most are very low (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Anomalies:** The repeated use of __all__ as a string is a coding mistake, not malicious. It could cause import issues but not security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is straightforward, only handling imports and deprecation marking.\n- No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no handling of untrusted data.\n- The deprecation marker and relative imports are typical in package development.\n- The __all__ being a string is a minor coding error, not a security flaw.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the __all__ mistake but overall very low security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment that this code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The main issue is a minor coding anomaly (__all__ as a string), which does not impact security.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be very low, reflecting the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
