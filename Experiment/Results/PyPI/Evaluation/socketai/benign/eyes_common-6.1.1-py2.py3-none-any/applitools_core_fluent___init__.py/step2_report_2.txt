  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward module that imports classes/functions, marks the module as deprecated, and defines __all__. No data processing or external inputs are involved.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The logic is standard and correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues, malicious activity, or obfuscation detected.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a simple import and deprecation setup.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard module export.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, a straightforward import and deprecation marking.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others, no data processing or external communication.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious activity.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely for module setup and export.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any data processing, external communication, or suspicious patterns, the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned (all zero for malware and obfuscated, and zero for risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.  \n- There is no evidence to justify higher scores, as the code is standard, well-understood, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for deprecation warnings possibly indicating outdated code, but not a security risk per se)  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard module re-export with deprecation handling, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
