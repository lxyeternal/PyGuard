{
  "purpose": "This module imports specific classes and functions from the 'applitools.common' package, marks itself as deprecated, and defines its public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from imported modules and the __name__ variable for deprecation.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely manages imports and API exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes/functions, marks itself as deprecated, and defines __all__ for public API. It contains no data processing, external communication, or obfuscated/malicious code. The use of deprecated.module(__name__) is a standard deprecation warning. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for an SDK or library, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
