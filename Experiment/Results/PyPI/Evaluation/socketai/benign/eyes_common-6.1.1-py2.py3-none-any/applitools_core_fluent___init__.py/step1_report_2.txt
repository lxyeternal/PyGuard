{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import specific classes and functions from the applitools.common library, mark the module as deprecated, and define the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements from external modules, and the deprecated.module(__name__) call.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication. The deprecated module function may log or warn, but it is a benign, internal operation.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports and declares public API.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and functions from a third-party library, marks the module as deprecated, and sets the __all__ attribute. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The deprecated.module call is an internal deprecation warning. No external data input or output mechanisms are present, and no suspicious behaviors or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard Python package module with no malicious or suspicious content. It solely manages imports, deprecation, and public API exposure. No security issues are present.",
