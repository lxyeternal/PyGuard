  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe provided code is a straightforward Python module that:\n- Imports specific classes and functions from the 'applitools.common' package.\n- Sets up a deprecation warning via `deprecated.module(__name__)`.\n- Defines `__all__` to specify the public API.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n- No untrusted data inputs, outputs, or external communication are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The use of `deprecated.module(__name__)` is a standard deprecation warning mechanism, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- The code primarily manages imports, deprecation, and API exposure.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or intent evident.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n**Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The deprecation warning indicates the module is outdated, but this is a common practice and not a security concern.\n- No evidence suggests the code is performing any malicious actions or contains hidden payloads.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, standard module setup for an SDK or library.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided reports.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues. The reports are consistent with this assessment.",
