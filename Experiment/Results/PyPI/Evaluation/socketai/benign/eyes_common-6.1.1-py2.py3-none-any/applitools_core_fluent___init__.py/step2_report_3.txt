  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes/functions from the 'applitools.common' package, marks itself as deprecated, and defines its public API via `__all__`.\n- It does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain any dynamic or obfuscated code.\n- The use of `deprecated.module(__name__)` indicates deprecation, but this is a standard pattern for signaling outdated modules.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, obfuscation, or data exfiltration, are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as importing classes/functions, setting deprecation, and defining `__all__`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior detected; the code is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; the code is benign with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with the same accurate description and reasoning.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Correctly identifies the code as a re-export and deprecation marker, with no malicious intent.  \n- No data processing or external communication.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same as above, with consistent reasoning and no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Also consistent; describes the module as a simple re-export with deprecation, no issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is a standard module setup.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are correctly set to 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n- **Reasoning:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard Python module for re-exporting classes/functions with deprecation marking. No security risks or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is safe, and no changes are necessary.",
