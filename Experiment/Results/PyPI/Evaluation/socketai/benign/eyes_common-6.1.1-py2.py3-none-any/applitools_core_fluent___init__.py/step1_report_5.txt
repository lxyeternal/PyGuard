{
  "purpose": "To import and re-export specific classes and functions from the applitools.common library for use in other modules, likely as part of a visual testing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and applitools.common modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of import statements, deprecation handling, and defining __all__.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future compatibility features and specific classes/functions from the applitools.common library. It marks the module as deprecated using deprecated.module(__name__). It then defines __all__ to specify exported identifiers. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communication is present. The code appears to serve as a module interface or facade for other parts of the framework, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple re-exporting interface for certain classes related to visual regions and check settings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
