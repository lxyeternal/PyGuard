  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes and functions from the 'applitools.common' package, marks itself as deprecated, and defines its public API via `__all__`.\n- All reports consistently conclude that there are no malicious behaviors, suspicious code patterns, or security risks.\n- The code contains no data processing, external communication, or untrusted input handling.\n- The use of `deprecated.module(__name__)` is a standard deprecation warning mechanism, not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description: it only performs imports, deprecation marking, and exports.\n   - No errors, flaws, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is purely import/export with deprecation warnings, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The code is safe and does not pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malware activity is present; the code does not perform any malicious operations.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's actual behavior.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard module setup for an SDK or library, performing imports, deprecation marking, and API exposure.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the risk assessment is accurate.",
