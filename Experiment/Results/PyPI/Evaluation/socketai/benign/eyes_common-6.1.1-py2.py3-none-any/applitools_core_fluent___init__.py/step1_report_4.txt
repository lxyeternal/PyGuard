{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes from the 'applitools.common' package, marks the module as deprecated, and defines an export list for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'applitools.common' modules, usage of 'deprecated.module(__name__)', and the module's __all__ definition.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and re-exports classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'deprecated.module(__name__)' indicates deprecation, but no malicious or unusual behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs import statements, marks the module as deprecated, and defines the public API via __all__. There are no data input points, external communications, or sensitive operations. The use of 'deprecated' indicates an intention to phase out this module, but it does not suggest malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward and consistent with standard Python module practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module wrapper that re-exports certain classes and marks itself as deprecated. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this fragment.",
