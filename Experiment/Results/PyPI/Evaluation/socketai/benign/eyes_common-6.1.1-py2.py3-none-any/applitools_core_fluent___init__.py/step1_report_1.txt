{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and functions from the 'applitools.common' package, sets up deprecation warnings, and defines its public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'applitools.common' and 'applitools.common.fluent' modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up module imports and exports without executing any data flows or processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes deprecation warnings setup; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports specific components, marks the module as deprecated, and defines __all__ for public API. No data input, output, or processing occurs here. The deprecation call is standard practice for signaling outdated modules. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for an SDK or library, importing classes and functions, with deprecation warnings. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks detected.",
