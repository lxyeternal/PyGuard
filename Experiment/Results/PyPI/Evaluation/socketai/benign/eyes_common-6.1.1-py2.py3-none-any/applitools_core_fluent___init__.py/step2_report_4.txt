  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, whether the scores are appropriate, and if any issues or risks are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes/functions, marks itself as deprecated, and defines `__all__`.\n- No data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- The `deprecated.module(__name__)` call is a standard deprecation warning, not indicative of malicious activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n- No external communication, network activity, or data sinks.\n- The purpose appears to be re-exporting symbols for a library or SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n\n- **Presence of all imported classes and functions:** Yes, all are imported from `applitools.common` and `applitools.common.fluent`.\n- **Deprecation warning setup:** The `deprecated.module(__name__)` call is standard for signaling deprecation.\n- **No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation:** No evidence of such.\n\n### Potential Issues or Flaws:\n\n- **Deprecation:** The module is marked as deprecated, but this is a standard practice, not an issue.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** No malicious behavior or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Code complexity or suspicious patterns:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct, no security risk identified.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n\n- Given the analysis, all scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, this code is a standard, non-malicious module that re-exports classes and functions, with a deprecation warning. There are no security concerns, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a module interface with deprecation signaling. All scores are appropriate, and there are no hidden risks or malicious elements.",
