{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting modules and functions from the 'applitools.common' package, likely to facilitate easier imports for users of this package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'applitools.common' and the 'deprecated' module, as well as the explicit listing of exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily deals with module import/export and deprecation handling.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, marking the module as deprecated, and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains straightforward import/export statements and deprecation marking. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several classes and functions from a common package, marks the module as deprecated, and defines the public interface with __all__. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external communications. The code appears to serve as a wrapper or facade for other modules. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present. It is a standard module re-export with deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export with deprecation marking, containing no suspicious or malicious behavior. It is standard in nature and appears safe.",
