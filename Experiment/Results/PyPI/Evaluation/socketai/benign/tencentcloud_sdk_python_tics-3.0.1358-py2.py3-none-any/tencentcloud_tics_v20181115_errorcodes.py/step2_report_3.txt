  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Structure**:  \n   The code consists solely of constant string definitions for error codes, accompanied by licensing comments. There are no functions, input/output handling, dynamic code, or external communication mechanisms. The constants are straightforward, static assignments, typical for configuration or error code modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic operations.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Issues**:  \n   The reports do not identify any logical flaws or errors. The code's purpose is clear and simple: defining error code constants.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward static definitions.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as a static, non-malicious constants module.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, straightforward constant definitions with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified; the code is purely definitional.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, there's no reason to adjust the scores. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, safe set of error code constants.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
