  "purpose": "Define a set of constant error code strings for internal system errors, parameter errors, and quota limits.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments of string error codes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output handling is present.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only static variable definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated elements. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of string constants representing error codes. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks, and no data flows. The code does not include any executable logic, external calls, or dynamic behavior. It appears to be part of a larger system, providing standardized error identifiers. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions used for error handling. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a standard and safe code fragment.",
