  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only assigns static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; standard practice for error code definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains static constant definitions for error messages. There are no functions, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. All variables are assigned fixed string literals, and the code appears to serve as part of an error handling module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error code definition module with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
