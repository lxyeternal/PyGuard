  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of static string constants defining error codes.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, input handling, external communication, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with licensing comments and variable assignments, typical for configuration or error code modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No report indicates any suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not contain any functions, data flows, or external dependencies that could be exploited.\n   - The constant definitions are benign and serve a standard purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and thorough.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or misjudgments are evident.\n   - Since the code is purely static constant definitions, there's no reason to assign any risk higher than zero.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
