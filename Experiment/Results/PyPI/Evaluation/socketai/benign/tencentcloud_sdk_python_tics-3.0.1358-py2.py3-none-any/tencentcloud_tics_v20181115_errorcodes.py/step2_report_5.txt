  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple set of constant string definitions for error codes.\n   - No dynamic code, input handling, or external communication is present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments and constant assignments.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n   - The code does not contain any executable logic, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), reflecting the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns**:\n   - No issues are identified in the reports.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious component of an SDK or system error handling module.\n\n**Conclusion & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, static set of constant definitions for error codes.\n- There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note**: The reports are thorough and accurate. No changes are necessary.",
