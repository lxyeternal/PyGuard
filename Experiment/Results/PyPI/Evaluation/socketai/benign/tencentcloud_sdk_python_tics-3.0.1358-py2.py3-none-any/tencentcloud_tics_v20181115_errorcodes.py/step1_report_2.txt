  "purpose": "Define error code constants for internal system errors and parameter issues.",
  "sources": "None (constants defined as string variables).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions representing error codes for internal errors and parameter validation issues. The comments and license headers are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication mechanisms. The code appears to be a straightforward module for error code constants.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, non-malicious, static constants module used for error handling in a larger system. No signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
