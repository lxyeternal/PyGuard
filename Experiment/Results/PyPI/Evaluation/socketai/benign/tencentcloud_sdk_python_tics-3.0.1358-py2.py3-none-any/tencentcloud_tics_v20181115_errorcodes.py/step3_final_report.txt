{
  "purpose": "This code defines static string constants representing various internal error codes and parameter limits used in a larger system.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string assignments for error identifiers; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only contains constant definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely declarative with no dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants for error codes, with licensing comments. It contains no functions, input/output, dynamic code, or external communication. The constants are typical for error handling modules. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and clearly non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of error code constants with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
