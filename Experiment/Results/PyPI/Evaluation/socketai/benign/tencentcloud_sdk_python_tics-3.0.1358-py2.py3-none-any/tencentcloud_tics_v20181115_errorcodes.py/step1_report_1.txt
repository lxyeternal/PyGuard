{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant string error codes for internal system errors, parameter errors, and quota limits.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string literals; no input reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward constant definitions with standard licensing comments. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license information, comments, and variable assignments for error codes. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or data leaks are present. The structure and content are typical for configuration or error code definitions. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constant definitions for error codes with licensing information. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
