  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string constant definitions for error codes.\n   - There are no functions, input/output handling, dynamic code, or external communication.\n   - The license header and comments are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or code that could be exploited.\n   - No dynamic or runtime behavior, which reduces risk.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a configuration or constants module.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the code itself.\n   - The reports are consistent in stating that this is a benign, straightforward constants module.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - No report suggests any reason to increase the risk scores.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly challenge any assumptions about malicious intent; none are justified.\n   - The code does not handle inputs or outputs, so there's no surface for injection or other common vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, static declaration of error code constants with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The risk scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are justified, given the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code fragment is benign and safe, serving as a simple constants module for error codes in a larger system.",
