  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of static string constant definitions for error codes.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external communications.\n   - The code includes licensing comments and straightforward variable assignments.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Indicators:**\n   - No report mentions any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or code that could be malicious.\n   - The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The constant definitions are typical for error handling modules.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1.0 or 1), reflecting the clear and straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is just static constants, the likelihood of hidden malicious intent is negligible.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here, as the code does not process data or interact externally.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign set of error code definitions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of all reports.",
