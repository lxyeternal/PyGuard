  "purpose": "Defines a set of constant string error codes related to internal errors, parameter issues, and quota limits for a Tencent service.",
  "sources": "No input or external data is read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard error code definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of string constant definitions for error codes, including licensing comments and constant assignments. No dynamic code, input handling, or external communication is present. The content is straightforward and typical for a service SDK or API library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard definition of error code constants with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is unlikely to pose any security risk.",
