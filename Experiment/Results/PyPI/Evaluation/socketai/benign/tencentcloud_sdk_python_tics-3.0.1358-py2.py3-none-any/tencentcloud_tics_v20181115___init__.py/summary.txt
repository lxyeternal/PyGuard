  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign; however, reports 2 and 5 exhibit behaviors indicative of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising the security risk. Adjusting report 5's malware score to 0.6 and obfuscated score to 0.5 better reflects the suspicion level. Overall, the scores are aligned with the behaviors described, with moderate concern for reports 2 and 5."
