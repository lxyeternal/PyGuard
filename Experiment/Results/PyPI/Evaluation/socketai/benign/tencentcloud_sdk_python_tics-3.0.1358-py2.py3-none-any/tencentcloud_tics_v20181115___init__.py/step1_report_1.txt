  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is not explicitly clear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading environment variables, files, or user input (if present). The code may also load external modules or libraries which could act as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code. The code may send data over the network or modify system files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network sockets or files.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. No unusual or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. Variable naming appears normal. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries and patterns. No malicious payloads or behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized network activity are evident. The code appears straightforward, with normal control flow and no signs of obfuscation or hidden functionalities. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports supports the conclusion that it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical utility or processing script with no signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
