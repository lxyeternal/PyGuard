{
  "purpose": "These classes define data models for API request and response structures related to Tencent Cloud's threat intelligence services, primarily handling deserialization of API responses into structured objects.",
  "sources": "External data sources such as API responses passed into the _deserialize() methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or system interactions; data is assigned to object attributes without execution or external effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (API responses) into class attributes via _deserialize(), with no further processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors in warning messages ('memeber_set', 'fileds') are present but benign and do not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data model classes with property getters/setters and deserialization methods. No network, file, or code execution operations are present. The warnings about unused fields are standard. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The minor typos are superficial and do not affect functionality or security. The overall structure is typical of SDK data models, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe SDK data models for Tencent Cloud's threat intelligence API interactions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minor typographical issues are non-security relevant. The overall security risk is minimal.",
