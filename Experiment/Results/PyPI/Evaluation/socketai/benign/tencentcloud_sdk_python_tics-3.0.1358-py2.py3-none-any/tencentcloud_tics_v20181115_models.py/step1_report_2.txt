{
  "purpose": "Define data models for various security-related request and response structures used in Tencent Cloud's cybersecurity services, including domain, file, IP, threat, and threat info.",
  "sources": "Input data from external API requests; parameters passed into '_deserialize' methods; data from API responses.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to class attributes; warnings for unused parameters; no unsafe system calls or external network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> '_deserialize' methods -> class attributes -> response or further processing; no evidence of malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typographical errors in warning messages ('fileds' instead of 'fields') are present but are not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code is purely data model definitions with standard serialization/deserialization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes inheriting from 'AbstractModel' with properties and '_deserialize' methods to map response data into class attributes. It includes standard Python property decorators and input validation via warnings for unused fields. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a straightforward SDK data model implementation without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical set of data models for API communication within a security SDK. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signs are detected. The code is safe and intended for structured data handling.",
