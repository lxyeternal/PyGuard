{
  "purpose": "Defines a customizable toggle switch component for Streamlit, loading frontend either from localhost during development or from a local build directory in production.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (_RELEASE), file paths (os.path), user input via parameters, Streamlit's declare_component function.",
  "sinks": "Component rendering via declare_component, user interaction captured in toggle_value, no external data leaks or network requests.",
  "flows": "Environment variable determines URL source -> Component loads frontend -> User interacts with toggle -> toggle_value returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of localhost URL in development is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Streamlit custom toggle component with environment-based loading. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The environment-dependent URL is typical for development workflows. No anomalies or unusual patterns are present. The code's logic is clear, and the parameters are standard. No external data is processed insecurely, and no network requests are made to untrusted domains. The component's usage is safe, and the code structure is conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security issues. The minimal security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate given the environment-based URL switching, which is common in development. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation, and their security risk assessments are consistent with the code's behavior.",
