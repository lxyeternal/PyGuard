{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Streamlit toggle switch component that can be used within a Streamlit app for user interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file paths, and user inputs via Streamlit UI components.",
  "sinks": "Data is passed to the frontend component, but no direct sinks involve untrusted data affecting system security.",
  "flows": "Sources (user inputs and environment variables) flow into the toggle component, which then renders UI elements based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The component URL is conditionally set for local or production, which is typical. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally declares a frontend component either from a local URL during development or from a build directory in production. The 'st_toggle_switch' function configures toggle parameters and renders the component. The UI section is only active during development, serving as a test interface. No code injection, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious data handling detected. The code uses standard Streamlit practices and does not contain hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom toggle switch for Streamlit, with environment-based component loading. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. It is a benign UI component script.",
