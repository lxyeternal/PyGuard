  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security issues. The minimal security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate given the environment-based URL switching, which is common in development. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation, and their security risk assessments are consistent with the code's behavior."
