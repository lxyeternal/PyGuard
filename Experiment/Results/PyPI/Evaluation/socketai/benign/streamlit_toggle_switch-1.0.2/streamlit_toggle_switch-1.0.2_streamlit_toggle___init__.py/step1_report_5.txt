{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit custom toggle switch component with configurable properties, used for user interface interaction within a Streamlit app.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via __file__ path), local server URL (localhost:3001) for component development, and user interactions with the toggle switch and slider.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the toggle switch state and slider value; potentially vulnerable if untrusted data is used insecurely elsewhere, but no insecure data sinks are present here.",
  "flows": "User interacts with toggle switches, which update component state; toggle states influence slider enabled/disabled status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code is standard for defining a Streamlit component with development and production modes.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally loads a frontend component from a localhost URL during development, or from a local build directory in production. The toggle switch parameters are straightforward, and the code does not handle or process external untrusted input beyond user interactions within the Streamlit app. No insecure data handling, code injection points, or malicious behaviors are evident. The only potential concern is the dynamic component URL during development, but it is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a Streamlit custom toggle component with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard practices for development and production modes, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious activities.",
