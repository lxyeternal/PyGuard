  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code's purpose—creating a configurable toggle switch in Streamlit. Sources include environment variables, file paths, and Streamlit functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that the component is rendered via declare_component, with user interactions stored in Streamlit's session state.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard for such components.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, due to environment switching), aligns with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar accurate description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, just local URL serving during development.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard development pattern.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the environment-based component loading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leakage or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (due to environment-based URL), consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or insecure data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; development mode URL is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leakage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward UI component with no network requests, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1) due to environment-based URL switching, which is standard for development vs production, but not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0**.\n- The risk score, reflecting the environment-dependent URL, can be kept at **0.1**—a very low risk, typical for development environments.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (standard development practice, minimal security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard implementation of a customizable toggle switch component for Streamlit, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
