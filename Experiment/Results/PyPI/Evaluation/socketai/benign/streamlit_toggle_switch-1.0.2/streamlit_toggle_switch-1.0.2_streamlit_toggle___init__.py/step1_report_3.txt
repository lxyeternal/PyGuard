{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit custom toggle switch component with configurable labels and colors, used for user interface interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, local file paths, and user inputs via the toggle switches and slider.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the component function (_component_func) or URL is manipulated, untrusted input could influence external component behavior; however, the code itself does not directly process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "User interactions with toggle switches and sliders influence internal variables and UI state, but do not flow into external systems or leak data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The component URL switches based on environment, which is standard practice. No obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a toggle component with configurable labels and colors, depending on the release mode. When not in release mode, it connects to a local development server; otherwise, it loads a built frontend. User input is captured via toggle switches and sliders but does not appear to be sent externally or stored insecurely. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The environment-based URL switching is typical for development versus production environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Streamlit toggle component with environment-based configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
