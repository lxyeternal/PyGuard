{
  "purpose": "Define and render a Streamlit toggle switch component with configurable labels, colors, and behavior, including a demo when not in release mode.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, local file paths, and component parameters (label, key, default_value, colors).",
  "sinks": "Component declaration via URL or filesystem path, and usage of toggle values to control a slider.",
  "flows": "User interaction with toggle switches influences slider enable/disable state; component parameters influence rendering and behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual dynamic code execution; use of local URL in non-release mode is standard for development.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally declares a custom Streamlit component based on environment (_RELEASE). In development mode, it serves the component from localhost; in production, from a local build directory. The component is used to create toggle switches with various labels and colors. The toggle states are used to enable or disable a slider, which is a common UI pattern. No untrusted input sources or dangerous code paths are present. The code appears to be a typical implementation of a UI component with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Streamlit toggle component with a local development fallback. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for UI control in a web app.",
