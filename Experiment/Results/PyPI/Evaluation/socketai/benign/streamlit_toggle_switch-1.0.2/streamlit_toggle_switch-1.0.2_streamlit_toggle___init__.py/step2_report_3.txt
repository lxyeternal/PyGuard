  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to identify any discrepancies or issues.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines a Streamlit custom toggle switch component, configurable via parameters.\n- It conditionally loads the frontend component either from a local URL (development) or from a built directory (production).\n- The toggle switches are used within a test UI in non-release mode.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code appears standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n- The reported issues about the code's purpose, flow, and sources are accurate.\n- The code does not contain any malicious functions, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The toggle component relies on an external URL or local build, which is standard practice.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes\n- No errors or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The use of environment variables and local paths is appropriate.\n- The code's security posture appears sound.\n\n### Score Justification\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a low risk (~0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions\n- The only slight concern could be the dynamic URL during development (`http://localhost:3001`). However, this is standard for local testing and not malicious.\n- No evidence suggests that the component or the code is doing anything malicious like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9–1.0) are justified given the straightforward, standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\nBased on the detailed review:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, mainly due to development environment considerations, not actual security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical implementation for a customizable toggle component in Streamlit.\n- No signs of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or security issues are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
