{
  "purpose": "To create a toggle switch component in a Streamlit web application with configurable appearance and behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (_RELEASE), file paths (__file__), and streamlit input/output functions (st.header, st.write, st.columns, st_toggle_switch, st.slider).",
  "sinks": "Uses the _component_func to render a custom frontend component; the code does not directly send or receive data outside the app context.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable to determine development or production mode -> calls declare_component with appropriate URL or path -> user interacts with toggle switches and sliders -> toggle values stored in Streamlit session state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors; code appears standard for a Streamlit component setup.",
  "analysis": "The code configures a Streamlit component based on environment mode, defining a toggle switch with customizable colors and labels. It includes frontend component declaration via URL or local path, depending on the environment. The component is used within a conditional block meant for development testing, not production. The code does not perform network requests, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or unusual patterns are present. Overall, the code appears to be a typical implementation for a customizable toggle switch in a Streamlit app, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for a UI toggle component in a Streamlit application. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and intended for interface configuration and user interaction.",
