  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a Streamlit custom toggle switch component.\n- Loads the frontend component either from a localhost URL (development) or from a local build directory (production).\n- Provides a wrapper function `st_toggle_switch` with customizable labels and colors.\n- Contains a demo UI in non-release mode for testing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  The code is straightforward, standard for Streamlit components, with no evident security vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation.  \n  **No issues are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The logic is consistent and standard; no errors are apparent.  \n- The environment-based URL switching is typical, but **could pose a risk** if the localhost URL is maliciously redirected or if the component URL is manipulated externally, but this is standard practice during development.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of **0**, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1), which seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The malware scores are appropriately zero.  \n- The security risk scores could be slightly higher if one considers the potential for the component URL to be tampered with in a real attack scenario, but given the code's context, 0.1 seems acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection.  \n- The only concern might be the dynamic URL loading in development mode, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Risk scores above 0.5 are **not justified** based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any network requests to untrusted domains, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The component URL during development points to localhost or a local build, which is standard and not malicious.\n\n**Thus, malware score remains 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard development practices.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The scores reflect the absence of malware and minimal security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable considering environment-based URL switching)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, benign implementation of a Streamlit toggle component with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk score is appropriate, considering the environment-dependent URL loading, which is typical for development workflows but not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider deployment context; if this code were modified to accept external URLs or inputs without validation, the risk could increase. But as provided, it appears safe.",
