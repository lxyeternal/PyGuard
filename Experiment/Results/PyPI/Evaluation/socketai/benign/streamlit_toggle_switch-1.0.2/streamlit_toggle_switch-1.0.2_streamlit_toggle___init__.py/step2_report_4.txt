  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of their conclusions, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Implements a Streamlit custom toggle switch component.\n- Loads the frontend component either from a localhost URL (development) or from a local build directory (production).\n- Provides a UI for testing toggle switches and a slider during development.\n- No evident malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- Uses standard Streamlit practices.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of issues in the code**\n\n**Confirmed:**  \n- The code appears functionally correct and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Environment-based component loading is standard practice.\n\n**No issues detected.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning**\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard implementation for a UI toggle component.\n- They acknowledge the environment-based component URL switching, which is typical.\n- No report claims the code performs network requests beyond loading the component frontend, which is accurate.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign and safe.\n\n**Potential concern:**  \n- Some reports mention \"security risk\" scores of 0.1, citing the environment-based URL switching as a minor concern. This is a standard development practice, not a security risk per se, but they are cautious.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores given to each issue**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, mainly due to environment-based URL switching, which is standard but possibly viewed as a minimal risk if, for example, the URL could be manipulated. Given the code's context, this is a minor concern, but overall acceptable.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9 to 1), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The minor security risk scores could be slightly reduced to 0, as environment-based URL switching is a common development practice and not inherently risky unless misused.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5**\n\n- All risk scores are below 0.5, indicating low concern.\n- The highest is 0.2, which is acceptable given the context.\n- No issues warrant higher scores, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware scores**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n- No malicious activity or code is present.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims based on assumptions**\n\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n- They recognize the environment-based URL as standard practice, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- Minor security concerns are acknowledged but do not elevate the overall risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of a custom Streamlit toggle component.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The environment-based component loading is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n## Final estimated scores:\n\n| Category          | My assessment | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | **0**           | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated        | **0**           | Clear, straightforward code.                                |\n| Risk              | **0.0 - 0.1**   | Very low; mainly the environment URL switching, which is standard. |\n\n**I would set:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (to acknowledge minimal concern about environment URL, but effectively negligible)\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or security-critical issues. The scores assigned are reasonable, though they could be slightly lowered for the minimal concerns noted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- No security risk or malware concerns.  \n- The code is safe for deployment.",
