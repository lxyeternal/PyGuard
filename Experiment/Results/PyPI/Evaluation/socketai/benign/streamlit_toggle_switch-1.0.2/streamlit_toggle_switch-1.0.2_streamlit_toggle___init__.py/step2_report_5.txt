  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to identify any discrepancies, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom Streamlit toggle component with environment-based configuration (local URL during development, build directory in production).  \n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are evident.  \n- The toggle component's parameters and usage are straightforward, with no evident data leakage or malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup for a UI component with environment-dependent component loading.  \n- They note the absence of hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious patterns.  \n- The only potential concern raised is the use of a localhost URL during development, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern for security vulnerabilities.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No issues justify a high risk score; the code is benign.  \n- The minimal security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate, considering the environment-based URL switching and no direct external data handling.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports correctly state that the code does not perform network requests beyond the component declaration, nor does it process untrusted data insecurely.  \n- The use of localhost URL in development is standard; no backdoors or malicious code are suggested.\n\n**Step 6: Check consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- All reports' scores are consistent with the code analysis.  \n- Malware scores of 0 are justified.  \n- Security risks are minimal and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, readable code.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — Very low, reflecting standard development practices and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a customizable toggle component for Streamlit.  \n- The environment-based component loading is standard and does not introduce security concerns.  \n- No suspicious patterns, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's actual behavior.",
