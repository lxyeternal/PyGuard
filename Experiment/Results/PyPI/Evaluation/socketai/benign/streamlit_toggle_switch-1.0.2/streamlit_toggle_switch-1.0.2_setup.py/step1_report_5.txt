  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'streamlit_toggle_switch' Python library.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data sources read by the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no potential data leaks, no external data sinks or network activity).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package info such as name, version, author, description, URL, and required Python version. The dependencies are limited to a standard package ('streamlit'), and no dynamic code execution, external data access, or sensitive operations are present. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues.",
