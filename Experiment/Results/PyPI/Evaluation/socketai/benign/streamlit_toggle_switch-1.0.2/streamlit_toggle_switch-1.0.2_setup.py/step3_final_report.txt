  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields, including name, version, author, email, description, URL, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools with static metadata and dependencies. It contains no runtime logic, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, correctly assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The email address, while personal, does not impact security assessment. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify the scores and high confidence in its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
