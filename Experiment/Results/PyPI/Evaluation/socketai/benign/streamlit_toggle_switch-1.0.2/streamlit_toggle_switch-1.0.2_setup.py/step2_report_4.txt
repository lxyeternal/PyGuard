  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The provided code is a standard Python `setup.py` script using `setuptools`. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.\n   - There are no signs of code obfuscation, malicious code, or runtime logic beyond static configuration.\n   - The code does not read external data, accept user input, or perform any network or file operations at runtime.\n   - The email address provided is a personal email, but this alone is not suspicious or malicious.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Findings:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no anomalies, no obfuscation, and no malware indications.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's static and benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Justifications:**\n   - Since the code is purely a package setup script with no dynamic or runtime behavior, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted based solely on this code snippet.\n   - The only point to note is the personal email, but that does not impact security or malware assessments.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
