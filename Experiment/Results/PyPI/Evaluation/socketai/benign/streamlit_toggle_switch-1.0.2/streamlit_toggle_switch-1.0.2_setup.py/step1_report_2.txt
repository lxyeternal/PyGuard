  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'streamlit_toggle_switch'.",
  "sources": "Constants and function calls providing package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no network or file operations, no sink points for data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines package setup parameters without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a straightforward setup script without obfuscated elements or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup' with static metadata and dependency information. All fields contain fixed, hard-coded values related to package metadata, author info, dependencies, and packaging options. No input reading, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations are present. The script is typical for Python package distribution, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script for distributing a Python module. There are no indicators of malicious code, data leaks, or security risks. The package appears safe based on this code fragment.",
