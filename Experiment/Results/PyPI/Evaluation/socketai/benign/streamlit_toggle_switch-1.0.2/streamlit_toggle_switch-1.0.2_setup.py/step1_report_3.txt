  "purpose": "To set up and configure the packaging details for the 'streamlit_toggle_switch' Python library.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup configuration with no suspicious or unusual code structures, secrets, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. All parameters are standard for Python packaging. No input/output, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution are present. The email provided appears to be a personal email address, but this is not inherently malicious or suspicious. The code strictly performs package setup without any additional logic or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
