{
  "purpose": "The code defines a data structure 'SecondaryEmail' for storing a user's secondary email address and verification status, with associated validators.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and defines class attributes; no external input sources are explicitly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows, as the code primarily sets up data structures and validators without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions, attribute setup, and validator assignments, all standard for data modeling in Python. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The presence of auto-generation comments and use of third-party modules (stone, dropbox) suggest it is part of a legitimate SDK or API client code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign data model definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
