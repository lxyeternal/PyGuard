  "purpose": "Define a data structure for secondary email addresses with validation.",
  "sources": "Input data for email and verification status during object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly used in a dangerous context.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to class attributes, validated through validators, but no flow leads to security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data class definition with validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'SecondaryEmail' for handling secondary email addresses, including validation mechanisms. It imports validation schemas and defines attributes with associated validators. No user input is processed in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior are apparent. The only potential concern is the use of email validation, but it is standard practice and relies on external validators, not embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, auto-generated data structure with validation for email addresses. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code within this module.",
