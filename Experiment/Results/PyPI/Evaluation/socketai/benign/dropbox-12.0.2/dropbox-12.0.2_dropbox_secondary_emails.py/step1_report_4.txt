  "purpose": "Define a data structure for secondary email addresses with validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method: email, is_verified",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external data outputs or untrusted data handling shown",
  "flows": "Input parameters (email, is_verified) are assigned to attributes with validators, no external data flows evident",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is auto-generated, structured, and contains validation for email addresses.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class 'SecondaryEmail' with attributes 'email' and 'is_verified'. It employs validators for these fields, ensuring proper data types (email format and boolean). There are no suspicious or malicious operations such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The structure is typical for data modeling, and the presence of validators suggests a focus on data integrity rather than malicious activity. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow are present. The code appears to be an auto-generated part of a larger SDK or API client, serving data validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data structure definition for secondary emails with validation. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign component intended for data validation within a larger application.",
