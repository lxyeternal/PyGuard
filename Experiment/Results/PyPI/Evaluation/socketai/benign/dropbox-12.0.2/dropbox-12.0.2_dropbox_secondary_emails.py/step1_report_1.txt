{
  "purpose": "Defines a data structure for secondary email addresses, including validation and attributes, used within a Dropbox-related context.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (`stone.backends.python_rsrc`, `dropbox.common`), class attribute initializations, and the constructor method that assigns values to attributes.",
  "sinks": "Attribute assignments and validation setup do not involve untrusted data directly, nor do they handle input streams or output data.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns input parameters to class attributes; validators are set for email and verification status. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears auto-generated, uses standard patterns for data classes, and contains no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data structure for secondary emails with validation. It imports external libraries, sets up attributes with validators, and initializes the class with optional parameters. No sources of untrusted data are processed in a way that could lead to security issues. The setup for validators suggests input validation but does not include any risky handling or processing of external input beyond attribute validation. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and does not contain suspicious behavior or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated data structure definition with validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall security risk is minimal.",
