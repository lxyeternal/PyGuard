{
  "purpose": "This code defines a data structure for a secondary email address with verification status, using validation schemas.",
  "sources": "Imports from stone.backends.python_rsrc and dropbox.common; initialization of class attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data storage are present",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiation through attribute setting to validation, with no external input or data output points",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code appears to be a typical data schema with validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a structured representation for a secondary email, including validation rules. It imports modules for validation and common email validation. The class uses standard patterns for defining attributes with associated validators. No external inputs, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears auto-generated and solely for data modeling, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model with validation, showing no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign application or library for managing user email data.",
