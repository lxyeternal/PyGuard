  "purpose": "Defines a data structure 'SecondaryEmail' with email and verification status, including validation.",
  "sources": "External validators for email and boolean validation, attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks; validation occurs locally.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to attributes, validated via external validators, no external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated data class with validation for email and verification status. It uses standard validation modules and does not process untrusted data in a risky way. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious constructs are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with its function as a data validation schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated data structure for managing secondary email addresses with validation. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
