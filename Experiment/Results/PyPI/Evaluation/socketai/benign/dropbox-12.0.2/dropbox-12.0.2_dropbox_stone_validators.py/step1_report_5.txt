  "purpose": "Import all contents from the 'stone_validators' module within the 'stone.backends.python_rsrc' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement, which reads the module and its contents during code execution.",
  "sinks": "The import itself does not constitute a sink, but the imported functions or classes could be used later as sinks if called with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent from this single line; it merely imports the module.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a module and its contents; there is no malicious code, data handling, or suspicious behavior visible at this point. Since no functions or code execution occurs here, potential malicious activity depends on how the imported module is used later, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this line. It does not perform any actions or contain suspicious constructs.",
