  "purpose": "Import all validators from the stone_validators module within the stone.backends.python_rsrc package.",
  "sources": "The code imports a module; no data input or external data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident; this is only an import statement with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module from a specified package path. It does not execute any code, read user input, or handle data directly. No suspicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution is visible at this stage. Since it's an import statement, it alone cannot indicate malicious intent, but it also provides no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of an import statement for a module. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks evident from this snippet. It appears to be standard import syntax without any malicious intent.",
