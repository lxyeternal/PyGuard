  "anomalies": "Use of eval() to parse version string, which can execute arbitrary code if the source is maliciously modified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with standard package configuration. The primary security concern is the use of eval() on a line extracted from a source file to determine the version. This pattern is unsafe because if the source file is tampered with, malicious code could execute during setup. No other suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malware are present. The scores assigned in the reports correctly reflect this risk: malware and obfuscation are absent (score 0), while the security risk due to eval() is moderate (around 0.2-0.4). The concern is primarily theoretical unless the source file is compromised. Best practice is to replace eval() with safer parsing methods such as ast.literal_eval().",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard but contains a known anti-pattern in using eval() for version parsing. No malware or malicious activity is evident. The risk stems from potential code execution if the source file is maliciously altered. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score should be acknowledged but not overstated. Replacing eval() with safer alternatives is recommended to mitigate this risk.",
