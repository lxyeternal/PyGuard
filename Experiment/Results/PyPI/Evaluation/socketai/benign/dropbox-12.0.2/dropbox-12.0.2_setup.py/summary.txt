  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard but contains a known anti-pattern in using eval() for version parsing. No malware or malicious activity is evident. The risk stems from potential code execution if the source file is maliciously altered. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score should be acknowledged but not overstated. Replacing eval() with safer alternatives is recommended to mitigate this risk."
