  "purpose": "The script sets up the package configuration for the Dropbox Python SDK, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'dropbox/dropbox_client.py', reading 'test/requirements.txt', and reading 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "The eval() function used to determine version, reading files from disk, and printing error messages.",
  "flows": "File reading for version info and requirements, then passing data into setup(). No external untrusted data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on data read from 'dropbox_client.py' to determine version is potentially unsafe. No other suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup tasks with dependencies and metadata. It reads the version string from a source file using eval(), which could execute arbitrary code if the source file is maliciously modified. It reads requirements and README files safely. No network connections, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed. The rest of the code follows standard setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with the only notable concern being the use of eval() to parse the version string, which could be a security risk if the source file is compromised. Overall, no malicious intent or harmful behaviors are apparent.",
