{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, validators, and routing logic for handling OpenID user information and error responses, likely as part of an SDK or API client for interacting with an OpenID provider.",
  "sources": "Imports from stone.backends.python_rsrc modules; class attribute assignments; class method calls; default value assignments; routing configuration at the end.",
  "sinks": "Creation of route 'userinfo'; validation assignments; exception raising in getter methods; class instantiations; attribute setting.",
  "flows": "Imports -> class definitions and validators -> setting class attributes and validators -> instantiation of error and success objects -> route setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded URLs found. The code appears to strictly define data structures and routing logic without any dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated code. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on defining data models, validation schemas, and routing configurations for an OpenID client or SDK. It uses validators and structured data classes to handle user info and error responses. No code executes external commands, accesses environment variables, or performs network operations. The presence of auto-generated comments and structured class design indicates standard SDK code generation. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent such as embedded payloads, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard SDK code snippet that defines data models and routing for an OpenID service. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code. It appears to be a safe, structured, and legitimate part of an OpenID client implementation.",
