{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures, error handling classes, validators, and route configurations for an OpenID user info SDK component, likely for Dropbox, using the 'stone' framework. It facilitates error management, user info retrieval, and routing without performing external data processing or network operations.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, attribute definitions, and route setup functions within the code, primarily reading static class attributes and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data inputs, network calls, or untrusted data processing points; the code does not write to files, send data over networks, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves class instantiation and attribute validation, with no external data flow or untrusted data passing through the code; it mainly sets up data models and route definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is auto-generated, structured, and standard for SDK components.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated SDK module for handling OpenID errors, user info, and routing. It uses standard class definitions, validators, and route setup without dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code relies on trusted external libraries ('stone') for validation and structure, and no external data inputs are processed at runtime.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and typical of SDK components for OpenID interactions. It shows no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, low security risk) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
