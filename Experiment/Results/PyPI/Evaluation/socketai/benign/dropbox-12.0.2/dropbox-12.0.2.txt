      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The setup script is standard but contains a known anti-pattern in using eval() for version parsing. No malware or malicious activity is evident. The risk stems from potential code execution if the source file is maliciously altered. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score should be acknowledged but not overstated. Replacing eval() with safer alternatives is recommended to mitigate this risk."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard bootstrap utility for setuptools, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the insecure download fallback, which is acceptable within the context but warrants caution in untrusted environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated import stub with no malicious intent. The small security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate given the dependency on an external module, which could theoretically be compromised, but no evidence indicates malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0."
