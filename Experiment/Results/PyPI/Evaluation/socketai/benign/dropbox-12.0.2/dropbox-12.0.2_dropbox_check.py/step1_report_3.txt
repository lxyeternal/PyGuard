  "purpose": "Define data structures and routes for an RPC API to echo a string back from Dropbox servers.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from class constructor parameters 'query' and 'result', which are set via class attributes. No external data sources are directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present. No untrusted data is directed to any sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'query' flows from class instantiation to the 'query' attribute, and the 'result' flows similarly. These are validated strings but not used in any malicious context.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, with no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines structured data classes for RPC communication, with validation on string length. No external system calls, network activities, or data leaks are detected. The purpose is purely data serialization/deserialization for API endpoints. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident, and the code appears to be standard generated API schema.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated API schema for echo functionality, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected. It appears to be a benign, functional part of an RPC framework.",
