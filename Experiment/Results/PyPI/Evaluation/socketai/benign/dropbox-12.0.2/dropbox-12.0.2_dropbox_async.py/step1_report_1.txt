  "purpose": "Auto-generated import stub for asynchronous module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .async_ module",
  "sinks": "None present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "Use of auto-generation comment, no actual code logic, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated module that imports from a local async_ module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any logic that could be exploited. The comments suggest it's a generated stub, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The only notable aspect is the import statement which could be part of a larger package but by itself poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign auto-generated module containing a simple import statement. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present based on this fragment.",
