  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as an auto-generated module with a simple import statement: `from .async_ import *`.\n- The code is minimal, with no logic, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- The comments indicate it is auto-generated, with no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern is the import of a module named `async_`, which could be a workaround for Python's `async` keyword, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Finds no issues, no suspicious patterns.\n- Confident in benign nature.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis is accurate; the code is benign.\n- The confidence is perfect (1.0).\n- No issues here.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9).\n- Notes potential concern about importing all attributes from a local module.\n- Mentions the filename `async_` and the workaround for Python keyword conflict.\n- Slightly elevated security risk (0.1), considering the import could be from a compromised module.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The concern about importing everything is valid but not malicious in itself.\n- The note about potential risks from the imported module is reasonable.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable, given the lack of context about the module's trustworthiness.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (no malware indicated)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- Risk: 0.1 (acceptable given the context)\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar to previous, benign, auto-generated.\n- Confidence at 0.8, slightly lower.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- The slightly lower confidence reflects less certainty but remains high.\n- No issues.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Confirms benign nature.\n- Full confidence (1.0).\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Accurate; the code is just an import statement.\n- No concerns.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9).\n- Notes the import of `async_` could be unusual but is likely a workaround.\n- No malicious activity observed.\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The concern about the module name is valid but not suspicious.\n- The code is benign.\n\n**Score adjustments:**\n\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, and given the code, there is no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with some reports assigning 0.1 to reflect minimal potential concern over the imported module.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign, auto-generated import stub.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No further adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to reliance on external module, but nothing suspicious)\n\nThis conservative estimate aligns with the provided reports and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
