  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a simple auto-generated import statement with no data flow, logic, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — all appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The import is straightforward; the comments note potential naming conflicts with 'async_' to avoid Python keyword issues.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** No, the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the security risk score is slightly above zero, but given the code only imports a module, this is marginal.\n- **Justification for scores:** Since the imported module could contain malicious code, but we have no evidence here, the low securityRisk score is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The import is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — again, a minimal risk score, justified by the fact that the imported module's contents are unknown.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is just an import with comments.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The import is straightforward, with a note about potential risks if the source module is compromised, but nothing suspicious here.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight risk score reflects potential issues if the imported module is malicious, which is a reasonable assumption.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The slight security risk scores (0.1) are justified, considering the potential risk if the imported module is compromised, even though the code snippet itself is safe.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is accurate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal potential risk due to import source)\n\nThis code fragment is a benign auto-generated import stub with no malicious intent. The small security risk score is appropriate given the dependency on the imported module, which could theoretically contain malicious code if compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.",
