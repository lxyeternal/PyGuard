{
  "purpose": "Import a module named 'async_' to avoid Python keyword conflicts, as part of auto-generated code.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .async_ import *",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'async_' to circumvent Python's reserved keyword, which is a known pattern in auto-generated code but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated import statement with comments indicating it should not be modified. It imports all symbols from a local module named 'async_', likely a workaround for Python's 'async' keyword. No logic, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present. The import pattern is standard in generated code and does not indicate malicious intent. The comments and structure do not show obfuscation or malicious code. The potential risk stems from importing external modules, but in this context, the code itself is benign. The security risk score is set at 0.1 to reflect minimal concern about the source module's trustworthiness, but no evidence suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated import stub with no malicious intent. The small security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate given the dependency on an external module, which could theoretically be compromised, but no evidence indicates malicious behavior. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
