{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and validation schemas for Dropbox group management features, including classes for group info, types, and limits.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries; class initializations and attribute definitions; no untrusted external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No network transmission, file I/O, or external data leaks; purely data validation and schema definitions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes with validation, but no external or malicious data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of auto-generated data schemas, class definitions, and validators for group management. It contains no network calls, file operations, or executable logic. The structure is straightforward, with clear attribute definitions and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The validation setup is standard and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, boilerplate, auto-generated schema definitions for Dropbox group management features. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk present.",
