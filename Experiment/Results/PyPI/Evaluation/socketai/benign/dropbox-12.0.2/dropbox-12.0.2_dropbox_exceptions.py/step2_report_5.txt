  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling Dropbox API and HTTP errors.\n- All classes inherit from Exception or a subclass, with constructors setting attributes.\n- No external data sources, no network operations, no data processing, or obfuscation.\n- The code is purely structural for error handling, with __repr__ methods for debugging.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities. It is standard exception class definitions.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are evident. The implementation follows common Python patterns for custom exceptions.\n\n- **Scores suggested by reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code is benign; no malicious behavior or code execution. Malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, no obfuscation. Score should be 0.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the code's purpose—defining error classes—it poses no security risk. Risk score should be 0.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  The reports assume the code is purely structural, which is correct. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores given are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes with no security concerns.",
