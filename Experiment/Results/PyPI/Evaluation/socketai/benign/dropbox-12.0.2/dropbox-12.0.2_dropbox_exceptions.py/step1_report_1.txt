  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Dropbox API errors and HTTP errors with specific context.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading code present).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or data leaks).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink, as the code is solely class definitions).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains class definitions inheriting from Exception to represent various error types related to Dropbox API and HTTP errors. It uses standard patterns, calls superclass constructors appropriately, and provides __repr__ methods for debugging. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no external data sources, no handling of user input, and no risky operations. All classes are purely structural for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is well-structured and appears safe.",
