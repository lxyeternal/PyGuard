  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Dropbox API and HTTP error handling.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and __repr__ methods that set attributes and format error messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; classes are used for error representation only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes inheriting from a base DropboxException, with constructors setting relevant attributes and __repr__ methods for debugging. No external data input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code is purely structural, serving as error containers. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code aligns with standard Python exception practices, and the __repr__ methods do not execute untrusted code. The overall design is safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for Dropbox API error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
