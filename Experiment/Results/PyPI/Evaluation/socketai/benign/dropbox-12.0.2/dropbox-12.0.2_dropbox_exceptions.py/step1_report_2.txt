{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Dropbox API and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; mainly class definitions and constructor initializations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; primarily object instantiations and string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code uses standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base DropboxException, with constructor methods setting attributes and string representations. No external data inputs are read, nor are there any outputs or network operations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve as a structured error handling module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for API and HTTP error handling. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard application code for error management, with no suspicious or malicious features detected.",
