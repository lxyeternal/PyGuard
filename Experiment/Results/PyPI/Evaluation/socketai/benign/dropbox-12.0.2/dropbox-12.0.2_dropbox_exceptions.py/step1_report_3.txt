{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Dropbox API errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines classes and constructors, with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; the code only establishes exception classes and their representations without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. It models different error types related to Dropbox API, with constructors initializing attributes. There are no external data reads, no network operations, no code injection, or data leaks. The __repr__ methods format output representations but do not execute untrusted code or perform risky operations. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Dropbox API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a secure and standard pattern for error representation.",
