  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Dropbox API errors and related HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), __repr__ methods, and class attributes such as request_id, error, message, status_code, body, backoff.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "Initialization of error objects with request_id and other details, representation methods for debugging or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. All code appears standard for exception class definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python exception class definitions to encapsulate API and HTTP error details. Each class captures relevant information such as request IDs, error messages, status codes, and bodies. The __repr__ methods provide formatted string representations. No external data input sources, no data leaks, or code that could be exploited for malicious purposes are present. The design aligns with typical error handling patterns, and there is no indication of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe, well-structured, and intentionally designed for error management.",
