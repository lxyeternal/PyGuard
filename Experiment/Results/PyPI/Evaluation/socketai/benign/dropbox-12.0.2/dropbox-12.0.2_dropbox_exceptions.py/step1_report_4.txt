  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various Dropbox API errors.",
  "sources": "Initialization of exception objects with request IDs, error messages, status codes, bodies, and optional error details.",
  "sinks": "Representation methods (__repr__) that format exception details for output or logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into exception attributes, then into formatted string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The code purely defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions inheriting from Exception. Each class captures specific error details and formats them for output. There are no data inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system modification. The classes are straightforward, primarily for error handling within the Dropbox SDK or API client, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception classes intended for error reporting in a Dropbox API context. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be standard error handling code with no malicious intent.",
