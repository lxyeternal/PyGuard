  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is purely class definitions for exception handling, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, no network activity, and no code injection.\n\n2. **Potential Security Risks or Vulnerabilities:**  \n   The code only defines exception classes, which are standard in error handling. There are no hardcoded secrets, no input processing, and no operations that could be exploited. The `__repr__` methods are used for debugging/logging, which is typical.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. This is appropriate.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk, which is justified given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Any Issues or Inconsistencies:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   Since the code is a dependency intended for error handling, it’s unlikely to be malicious unless it has been tampered with in the supply chain. However, the code as presented is benign.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type        | Recommended Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected.                                                                  |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                   | Code is clear, straightforward class definitions.                                                 |\n| Security Risk     | 0                   | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or exploitable logic present.                                      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Dropbox API context. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
