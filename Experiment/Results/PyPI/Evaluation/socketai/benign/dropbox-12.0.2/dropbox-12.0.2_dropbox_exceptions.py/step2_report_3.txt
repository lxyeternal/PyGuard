  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling related to Dropbox API and HTTP errors.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is purely structural, with no data input, output, or network activity.\n- The __repr__ methods are used solely for debugging/logging purposes, formatting exception details.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any external data handling, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- The exception classes inherit properly from Exception and its subclasses.\n- No evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.\n- The reports' confidence scores are all 1.0, which aligns with the clear, benign nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The report notes that the code is \"well-structured\" and \"standard,\" with no suspicious elements, which is accurate.\n- No changes needed in the scoring; the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriately low or zero.\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical set of exception classes for error handling, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- Malware score should be 0.\n- Obfuscated score should be 0, given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no security concerns. The scoring reflects this, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
