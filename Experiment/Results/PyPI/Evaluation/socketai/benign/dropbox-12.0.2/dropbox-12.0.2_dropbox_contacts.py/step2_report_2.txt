  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as auto-generated API schema definitions and data structures for deleting manual contacts.\n- They consistently note the use of validation (email address validation), route definitions, and error handling.\n- No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), and malware scores are zero across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n**Code presence of issues:**\n- The code is straightforward data models and route definitions.\n- No actual data flow to external sinks (like network, file system, or system modifications) beyond route invocation.\n- Validation functions are standard and imported from trusted modules.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated, which is typical for SDKs or API clients.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are low, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are reasonable.\n\n**Malware justification:**\n- Since no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on standard validation and data structure definitions.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted.\n\n**Consistency:**\n- The scores and assessments are consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, auto-generated, and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1 - 0.2** — very low, given the nature of the code, primarily validation and API route definitions.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical API SDK component with no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- The high confidence levels support the benign interpretation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**           | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**           | Code is clear, auto-generated, with no obfuscation.        |\n| Security Risk  | **0.1**         | Very low; standard API schema with validation.             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
