{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, validation, and routes for deleting manual contacts, likely as part of an API client or server module.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules, class constructors, and attribute definitions that read data such as email addresses.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical actions. Validation is applied to input data.",
  "flows": "Input data (email addresses) flows through validators and into data structures, then used in API route definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No evidence of malicious payload or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of data classes, validators, and route definitions. It uses external validation libraries and structures data for API calls. No suspicious behavior, such as network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms, is present. The code appears to be auto-generated, with proper validation and error handling. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models and API route setup for contact deletion features. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
