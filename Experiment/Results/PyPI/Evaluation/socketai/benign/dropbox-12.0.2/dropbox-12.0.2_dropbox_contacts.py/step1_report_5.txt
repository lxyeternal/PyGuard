{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures, validation, and routes for deleting manual contacts in a Dropbox-related API client.",
  "sources": "Code reads from import statements, class initializers, and method calls such as validators and route definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include route definitions that could be invoked with untrusted data, but no direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters (e.g., email_addresses) flows through validators and into API route calls; however, no unsafe data handling or external system modifications are directly observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are detected. The code is primarily data structure definitions and routing logic, with no evidence of obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of class definitions for data validation and API route setup. It uses standard validation for email addresses and structured error handling via a tagged union. No code injection, network communication, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be auto-generated and is typical for API client SDKs. There are no anomalies like hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, auto-generated API client component for deleting contacts. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
