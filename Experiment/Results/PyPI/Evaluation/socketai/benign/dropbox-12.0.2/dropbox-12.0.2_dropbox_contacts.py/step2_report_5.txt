  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is auto-generated API schema definitions with validation and error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, security risk is low (0.2).\n- **Assessment:** The logic and code structure are benign. Validation uses external validators, and no external sinks or malicious payloads are evident.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0 is appropriate; risk=0.2 reflects minimal concern, consistent with the report.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on data structures and route definitions for contact deletion. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Malware=0, security risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code or behavior. The code is standard SDK/API client code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0 is appropriate; risk=0.2 is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—data classes, validation, route setup, no malicious behavior. Malware=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings, no issues.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, risk=0.2 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard API client code with data validation and route definitions. No malicious code or obfuscation. Malware=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; code appears legitimate.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, risk=0 is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign code, standard data structures, validation, and route setup. No malicious activity. Malware=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior assessments.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, risk=0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior. I agree with a malware score of **0** across the board.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clearly auto-generated, straightforward, and lacks obfuscation. I would set **obfuscated=0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, validation, and absence of malicious or suspicious patterns, I would assign a **risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2**. The reports' scores of 0.1 to 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated API schema with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n- I recommend setting:\n  - **malware = 0**\n  - **obfuscated = 0**\n  - **securityRisk = 0.1 to 0.2**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.",
