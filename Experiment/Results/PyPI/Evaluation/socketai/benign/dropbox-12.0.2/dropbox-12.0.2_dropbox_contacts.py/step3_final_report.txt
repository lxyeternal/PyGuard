{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures, validation, and API routes for deleting manual contacts within a contact management system.",
  "sources": "Input data from external validation functions (e.g., email addresses), route invocation parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; route calls may invoke network requests, but no malicious activity detected.",
  "flows": "Input data validated via external validators, passed through route functions, with no suspicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns; code is auto-generated SDK-like structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes with validation, route definitions for API calls, and error handling structures. Validation relies on trusted external modules, and no network or file I/O beyond route invocation is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The code appears to be a standard SDK component for contact deletion, with no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API schema for contact management, with proper validation and route setup. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
