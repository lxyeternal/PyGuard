  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SendgridBackend's handling of sandbox mode and mail settings in different Django settings scenarios.",
  "sources": "User-defined variables, imported modules, override_settings context, EmailMessage instances, and method calls within tests.",
  "sinks": "The method backend._build_sg_mail(msg), which constructs email data payloads for Sendgrid.",
  "flows": "Test setup creates email messages and invokes _build_sg_mail under different settings to verify behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; test code uses stub API keys; no malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of comprehensive unit tests for email message configurations, especially related to sandbox mode settings. It uses controlled environments with override_settings to verify behavior, calls internal methods to build email payloads, and does not process external untrusted inputs. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or any suspicious actions. All variables are standard test constructs, and imported modules are from Django and Sendgrid libraries. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of unit tests for email sandbox mode handling in a Django project, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
