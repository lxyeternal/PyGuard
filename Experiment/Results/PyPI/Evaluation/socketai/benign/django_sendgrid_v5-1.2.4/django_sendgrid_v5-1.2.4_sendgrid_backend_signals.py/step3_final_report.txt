  "purpose": "Defines a custom Django signal named 'sendgrid_email_sent' for event notification purposes within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Import of 'django.dispatch' module; creation of 'sendgrid_email_sent' signal object",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import statement leads to creation of signal object; no data flow or external interactions occur",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's dispatch module and defines a signal, which is a standard pattern in Django for event handling. It involves no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, readable, and aligns with typical Django practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django pattern for defining a custom signal with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assess its safety, and no modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
