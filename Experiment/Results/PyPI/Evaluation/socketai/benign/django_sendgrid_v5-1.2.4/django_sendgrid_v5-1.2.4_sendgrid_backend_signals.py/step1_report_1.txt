{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Django signal named 'sendgrid_email_sent' to be used for event notification when an email sent via SendGrid occurs.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'django.dispatch' module and creates a signal object 'sendgrid_email_sent'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; the code only defines a signal.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django dispatch module to create a custom signal. It does not process input data, perform external communication, or execute any complex logic. The signal can be used elsewhere in the application to trigger actions when an email is sent. The simplicity and standard usage indicate no malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard pattern in Django applications for defining custom signals. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign and typical usage for event-driven programming.",
