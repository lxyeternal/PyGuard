  "sources": "Reading Django settings via hasattr and getattr; accessing data dictionary for personalization attributes.",
  "sinks": "Assigning data values directly to Personalization object properties; no external sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data from input dictionary flows into Personalization attributes via setattr, with no complex processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string comparison for version checking (e.g., '6' < '10') which can lead to logical errors; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data handling: retrieving settings safely and mapping a dictionary to a SendGrid Personalization object. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The version comparison uses string operators, which is fragile but not malicious. Data is assigned directly to object properties, which could be misused if data is malicious, but no malicious code or backdoors are present. The overall structure is clear and standard for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the fragile version string comparison, which could be improved but does not pose a security risk. The data assignment pattern is typical and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to minor logical issues, not malicious intent.",
