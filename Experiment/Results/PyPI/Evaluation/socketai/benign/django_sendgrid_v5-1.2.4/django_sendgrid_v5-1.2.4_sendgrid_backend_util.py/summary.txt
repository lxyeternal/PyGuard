  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the fragile version string comparison, which could be improved but does not pose a security risk. The data assignment pattern is typical and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to minor logical issues, not malicious intent."
