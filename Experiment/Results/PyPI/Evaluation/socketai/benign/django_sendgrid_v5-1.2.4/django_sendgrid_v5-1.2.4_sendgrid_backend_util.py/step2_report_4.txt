  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, code is straightforward. Minor concern about string comparison of version strings, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable. Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious intent, standard utility code. Slightly more cautious about data assignment, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Justified. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—safe, standard code. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, routine data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Also standard utility code, no malicious activity, minor concern about version string comparison.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and I concur. There's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports are clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor concern is the string comparison for version checking, which can lead to logical errors but is not malicious.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor, related to version comparison logic, not security.\n\n### Final note:\nWhile the code could be improved by comparing version numbers with a proper version parsing library (e.g., `packaging.version`), this is a correctness issue, not a security concern.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and contains no malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, with a very low security risk primarily due to minor logical issues, not malicious intent.",
