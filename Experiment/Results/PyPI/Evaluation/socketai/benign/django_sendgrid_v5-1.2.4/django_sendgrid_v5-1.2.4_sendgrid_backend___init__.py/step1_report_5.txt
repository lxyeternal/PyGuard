{
  "purpose": "The code imports components related to email backend and package version information, likely for configuring email sending and version tracking.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .mail and .version",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious behavior are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process external input",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple import statements referencing local modules. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The imports are standard practice for modular code organization. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve standard functions: importing a mail backend component and package version info. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
