  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns; standard import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements, importing a class or function from a local module and a version string. No external inputs, no data processing, no code execution or network activity, and no sensitive data handling are present. The code appears to be part of a larger package setup or implementation, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard import syntax used for module organization and versioning, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
