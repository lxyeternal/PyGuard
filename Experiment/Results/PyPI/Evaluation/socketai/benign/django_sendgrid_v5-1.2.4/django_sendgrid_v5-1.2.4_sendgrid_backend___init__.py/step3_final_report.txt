  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules (.mail and .version) to include email backend and version info.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow; static imports do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statements with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The use of '# noqa' is standard for suppressing linter warnings. The code is typical for modular Python packages and does not pose any security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, standard for package modules, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
