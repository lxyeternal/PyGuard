  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** The code only contains import statements from local modules, with no processing or data flow.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0, which is appropriate. The confidence is 1, which is justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above—only import statements, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same pattern—simple imports, no data flow or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above—standard import statements.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue Presence:** Same as above—just import statements, no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is only performing static import statements from local modules, with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code snippets and analysis.\n\n- **Additional notes:** Given the simplicity of the code, there is no evidence to suggest any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities. These import statements are standard in modular Python packages.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the actual content and security posture of the code snippet.",
