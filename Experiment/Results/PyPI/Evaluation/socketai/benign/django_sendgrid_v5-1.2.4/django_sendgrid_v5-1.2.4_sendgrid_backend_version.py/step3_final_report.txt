  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a static assignment with no input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string to __version__, a common practice for versioning in Python packages. It contains no input/output, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, static, and typical, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate benign, straightforward code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
