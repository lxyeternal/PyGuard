  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module as '1.2.4'.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string assigned to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded version string, which is common and not suspicious; no other unusual behavior or code anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version string variable. There are no input or output operations, no function calls, no dynamic code execution, and no evidence of malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard version declaration typically found in Python packages. Given the minimal content, there are no signs of security issues, malware, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving solely to declare a version identifier for the package. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
