  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, sinks, or data flows, and the code is minimal and standard.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The `obfuscated` score is also 0, aligning with the straightforward assignment. The `confidence` scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.  \n   **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree on zero malware and security risk, and the code is trivial, higher scores are unjustified.  \n   **Conclusion:** No justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity—no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation. The malware score of 0 across reports is correct.  \n   **Note:** No malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All assessments are based on observable code behavior, not assumptions. The code is static and standard.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a typical version declaration with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
