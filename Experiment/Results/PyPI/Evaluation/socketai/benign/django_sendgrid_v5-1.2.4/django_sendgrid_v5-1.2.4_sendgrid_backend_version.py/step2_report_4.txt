  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the codebase:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is simply a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, sinks, or data flows involved. The code is minimal and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this snippet is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is just a static version string assignment with no dynamic behavior, input, or external dependencies, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**  \n   The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no code execution, no network activity, no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The malware score remains at 0 across all reports.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable code features, which is correct.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n**My own estimate for scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.",
