  "purpose": "Utilities for discovering, validating, and handling X.509 credentials, including certificate loading, validation, and credential file location.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (X509_USER_CERT, X509_USER_KEY, X509_USER_PROXY), default file paths (/tmp/x509up_u..., ~/.globus/usercert.pem), file reading operations, and system information (os.getlogin, os.getuid).",
  "sinks": "File opening for reading certificates and keys, warnings, exceptions thrown during validation, and certificate expiry checks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and default paths provide data to functions that load and validate certificates. Certificate data is read from files, validated, and the validated path or certificate object is returned. Errors and warnings flow from validation checks to exception handling or warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated or future-supported X.509 support with a warning, dynamic path generation for certificates, and reliance on environment variables for sensitive paths. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors are present. The code performs standard certificate handling operations without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads and validates X.509 certificates from various sources, handling potential errors and expiry warnings. It employs standard cryptography library functions, manages environment variables, and system info for path generation. The deprecation warning is properly implemented. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. All operations follow typical credential management procedures, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for managing X.509 credentials, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It adheres to standard security practices for credential handling, with appropriate warnings for deprecated support. Overall, it is safe and does not pose security risks.",
