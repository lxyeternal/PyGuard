  "purpose": "Utilities for discovering and handling X.509 credentials, including loading, validating, and locating certificate files, with deprecation warnings for outdated support.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (X509_USER_CERT, X509_USER_KEY, X509_USER_PROXY), default paths (/tmp/x509up_u<uid>, ~/.globus/usercert.pem, ~/.globus/userkey.pem), and provided file objects or paths.",
  "sinks": "File reads for certificates and keys, environment variable access, and warnings; no untrusted data sinks or malicious data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables or file paths -> load_x509_certificate_file or open -> validate_certificate -> _timeleft for expiry check.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior; reliance on environment variables is standard but can be risky if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard credential management utility, performing certificate loading, validation, and discovery through environment variables and default paths. It issues deprecation warnings appropriately. No malicious or suspicious logic is present; the code uses common cryptography libraries and file I/O. The deprecation warning is informational. The handling of environment variables and file paths is typical for such utilities. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing X.509 credentials with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified due to reliance on environment variables, which is common but warrants cautious handling. Overall, it poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
