  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for managing X.509 credentials with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The low risk score (around 0.2) is justified due to reliance on environment variables, which is common but warrants cautious handling. Overall, it poses minimal security risk and is safe for use."
