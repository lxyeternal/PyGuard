  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard utility for discovering, loading, and validating X.509 certificates, with deprecation warnings. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code's purpose is clear, standard, and no malicious activity is detected. The deprecation warning is informational, not malicious.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is a benign utility for credential management, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code performs typical credential handling functions with no suspicious elements.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utilities for locating, loading, and validating certificates, with no evidence of malicious intent. The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables, which is standard practice.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that environment variables are standard and not malicious. No suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles certificate discovery and validation, with no signs of malicious activity. It includes a deprecation warning, but that is benign.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate utility for handling X.509 certificates, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The deprecation warning is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and standard practices.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose—loading and validating certificates, with no malicious or risky behavior—the risk scores are appropriately low (mostly 0.1-0.2). The only slightly higher score (0.2) is justified by the reliance on environment variables, which is typical but can be considered a minor security consideration.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard credential handling risk)\n\nThe provided reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard utility for managing X.509 credentials with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The deprecation warnings are informative, and the handling of environment variables and file operations is typical for such utilities.",
