  "purpose": "Utilities for discovering, loading, and validating X.509 credentials, including deprecated support and credential file location detection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (X509_USER_CERT, X509_USER_KEY, X509_USER_PROXY), default file paths (/tmp/x509up_u*, ~/.globus/), and file reading operations.",
  "sinks": "File reads for certificate and key validation, warnings, and error raising for invalid certificates.",
  "flows": "Source variables (environment or paths) to file open/read operations, then to validation functions which check certificate expiry and validity.",
  "anomalies": "The code accesses environment variables, reads certificate files, and issues warnings or errors for invalid certificates. It includes a deprecation warning for dropping support of X.509 credentials. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for locating, loading, and validating X.509 certificates, with deprecation notices. It reads environment variables and files, performs validation based on expiry, and handles errors according to user configuration. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The warning about support being dropped is informative and not malicious. The file operations and environment variable usage are typical for credential handling scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing X.509 credentials with no signs of malicious behavior. It is designed to locate, load, and validate certificates, issuing deprecation warnings appropriately. No malware or security risks are detected.",
