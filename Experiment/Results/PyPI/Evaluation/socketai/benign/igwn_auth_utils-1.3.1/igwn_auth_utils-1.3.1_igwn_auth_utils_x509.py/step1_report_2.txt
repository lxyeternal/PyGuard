  "purpose": "Utilities for discovering, loading, and validating X.509 credentials, including deprecation warnings and credential file search mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (X509_USER_CERT, X509_USER_KEY, X509_USER_PROXY), default certificate paths (/tmp/x509up_u*, ~/.globus/usercert.pem, ~/.globus/userkey.pem), file reading operations, os environment and user info.",
  "sinks": "File reads (certificate and key files), warning emissions, exception raising upon validation failures.",
  "flows": "Source variables and environment paths are used to locate certificate files; these files are then loaded and validated. Validation failure may trigger warnings or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code handles deprecated support and issues warnings accordingly. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically locates X.509 credential files via environment variables, default paths, and user directories. It loads and validates these certificates, raising warnings or errors based on validity. The deprecation decorator warns about dropping support for certain features. The functions perform standard file handling and validation routines using the cryptography library, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. All data flows are consistent with credential management. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for managing X.509 credentials with appropriate warnings and validation. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. It follows expected patterns for security credential handling without any indicators of malware or supply chain compromise.",
