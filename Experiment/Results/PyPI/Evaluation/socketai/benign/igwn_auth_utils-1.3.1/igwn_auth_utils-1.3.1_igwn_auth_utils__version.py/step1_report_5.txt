{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, for tracking package versioning.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string and tuple assignments for version information (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sources; no input or data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only assigns static data to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, dynamic execution, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables, assigns static version strings and tuples, and sets up type hints. It is generated by setuptools-scm, a common version control tool. No input/output, no external data sources, no suspicious logic or data flow present. The code appears to be a simple version info module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version information module with static assignments and no suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not pose any security threat.",
