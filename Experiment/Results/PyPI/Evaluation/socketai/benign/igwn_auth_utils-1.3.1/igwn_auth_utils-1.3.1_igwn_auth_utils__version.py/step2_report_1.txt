  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a straightforward version declaration for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.\n   - It contains static strings and tuples, with conditional type hints.\n   - There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no input/output processing, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - No secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent in the assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely static, with no external data, no execution, and no malicious intent, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - There is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All claims are based on the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code is a simple, auto-generated version declaration module with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately score the issues as benign.\n\n**My Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided and the code's nature.",
