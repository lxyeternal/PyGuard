  "purpose": "Define version-related metadata for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and version tuples.",
  "sinks": "None present; code only assigns static data without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no input or output flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and intended for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version information for a Python package, setting static string and tuple variables. It includes a conditional import block for type checking that doesn't execute at runtime. The version data ('1.3.1') is hardcoded and static, with no dynamic input, external data sources, or malicious code. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard version definition snippet generated by setuptools-scm, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
