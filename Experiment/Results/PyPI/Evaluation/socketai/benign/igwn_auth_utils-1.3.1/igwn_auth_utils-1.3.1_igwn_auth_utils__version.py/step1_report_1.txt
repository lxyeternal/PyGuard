  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package using setuptools-scm, with no operational behavior.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and type checking conditions.",
  "targets": "No data flows from external sources; no untrusted input or external data is processed.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow involving untrusted sources; the code only assigns static version information.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type checking block (if TYPE_CHECKING) is standard; no unusual or suspicious code patterns. No secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables for the package, with conditional type annotations for static analysis. All data is hardcoded, static, and does not involve any external input or sensitive information. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and standard for version definition files.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple, benign version declaration file for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
