  "purpose": "Static version declaration generated by setuptools-scm for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples, conditional type checking block.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated version info module with no dynamic behavior, external data, or security-sensitive operations. It contains only fixed strings and tuples, with conditional type hints. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a simple version metadata module. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature, assigning appropriate scores. No security concerns or malicious behavior are evident.",
