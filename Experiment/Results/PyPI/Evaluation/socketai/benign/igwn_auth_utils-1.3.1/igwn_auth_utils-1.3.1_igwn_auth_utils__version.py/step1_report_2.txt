  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and does not perform any runtime logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The code sources version strings and tuples assigned directly as constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; only static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward version metadata definition with no dynamic code execution, external input, or malicious constructs. It uses conditional typing for type hints, but this is standard and harmless. The version data is hardcoded and does not interact with any external data sources or system functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely metadata assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
