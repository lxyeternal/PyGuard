  "purpose": "Utilities for generating and exporting RSA key pairs for testing purposes in the `igwn_auth_utils` test suite.",
  "sources": "Cryptography library functions for key generation and serialization; file writing for PEM formatted public key.",
  "sinks": "Writing the public PEM key to a file in the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Generation of RSA private key -> Extraction of public key -> Serialization of public key to PEM -> Saving PEM to file",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; use of standard cryptography functions and straightforward file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates RSA key pairs using standard cryptography library functions. It serializes the public key into PEM format and writes it to a temporary file. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leakage, and no suspicious network activity. The code's purpose is to support testing, not production cryptography or key management. No obfuscation, malicious, or backdoor code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard cryptographic key generation and serialization for testing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses best practices for key handling within a test environment.",
