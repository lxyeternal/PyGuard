{
  "purpose": "Generate and format RSA keys for testing cryptographic utilities related to the `igwn_auth_utils` test suite.",
  "sources": "The code reads the `private_key` via the `generate_private_key()` function and the `public_key` via `private_key.public_key()`. It also reads `public_pem` from the key object and from the filesystem in `public_pem_path`.",
  "sinks": "The `public_pem` is written to a file in `public_pem_path` using standard file write operations. No untrusted data or external inputs are processed or stored outside the scope of test fixtures.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves generating an RSA private key, deriving the public key, serializing the public key into PEM format, and writing this PEM data into a temporary file for test purposes. No untrusted input flows into critical sinks, nor is there data leakage or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The cryptographic operations are standard, and the file write operations are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code uses cryptography library functions to generate RSA keys and serialize them, which is standard practice for cryptographic utilities. It includes fixtures for testing purposes, generating keys and saving them temporarily. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious activity. The use of cryptography APIs appears legitimate and consistent with their typical use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cryptographic utility for testing, generating RSA keys, and saving a public key PEM file. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended testing purpose.",
