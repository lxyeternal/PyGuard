  "sources": "Cryptography library functions that generate RSA keys and serialize them; file system operations writing PEM data.",
  "sinks": "Writing PEM-formatted public key data to a file.",
  "flows": "Generation of private key -> Derivation of public key -> Serialization of public key -> Writing serialized key to file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code simply generates cryptographic keys and writes data to a file.",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates RSA keys using standard cryptography library functions, with appropriate parameters. It serializes the public key into PEM format and saves it to a file. No user input is read, and no untrusted data flows are evident. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard utility code for cryptographic key generation and serialization, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
