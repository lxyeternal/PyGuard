  "purpose": "Utilities for generating and handling RSA key pairs for testing purposes in the `igwn_auth_utils` test suite.",
  "sources": "Code reads cryptographic key generation functions, and reads/writes the public key PEM to a file.",
  "sinks": "Writes the PEM-formatted public key to a file in the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Generation of RSA key -> Retrieval of public key -> Serialization of public key to PEM -> Saving PEM to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution or unusual code behavior. Use of cryptography library is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code generates an RSA private key with standard parameters, retrieves the corresponding public key, serializes the public key in PEM format, and writes it to a file in a temporary directory. The cryptography library is used in a typical manner for key generation and serialization. No data is transmitted over network, no secrets are hardcoded, and no malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to serve testing utility functions without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for generating and storing RSA keys for testing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
