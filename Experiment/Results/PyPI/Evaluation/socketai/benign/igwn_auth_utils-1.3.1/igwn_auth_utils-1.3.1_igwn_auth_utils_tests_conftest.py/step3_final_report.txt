  "purpose": "Utilities for generating RSA keys, serializing the public key to PEM format, and writing it to a temporary file for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads cryptographic parameters for key generation and reads/writes the public key PEM data to a file.",
  "sinks": "Writing the PEM-formatted public key to a file in the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Generate RSA private key -> derive public key -> serialize to PEM -> write PEM data to file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; uses standard cryptography library functions; no hardcoded secrets or network activity; straightforward file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic key generation and serialization using well-established libraries. It does not process untrusted input, transmit data over networks, or contain obfuscated code. The use of fixtures and temporary files aligns with best practices for testing environments. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to key generation in a test context, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for testing cryptographic key generation. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (around 0.0 to 0.1).",
