  "sinks": "Writing the public PEM key to a file, which is used for testing.",
  "flows": "generate_private_key -> public_key -> public_bytes -> open/write to file",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code generates cryptographic keys and writes a public key to a file in a standard manner. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptography modules to generate an RSA private key and derive the corresponding public key. It provides fixtures for testing, including key generation, serialization to PEM format, and saving the public key to a temporary file. The process appears standard for cryptographic key handling. No untrusted data inputs, network operations, or suspicious code execution paths are present. The code adheres to common best practices for key generation and storage in test environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test utility for cryptographic key handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely generates and stores cryptographic keys for testing purposes.",
