{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for IGWN authentication using SciTokens, X.509 credentials, and netrc, supporting secure credential discovery and request augmentation.",
  "sources": "Credential discovery functions (find_scitoken, find_x509_credentials, get_netrc_auth), input parameters (token, cert, auth, url).",
  "sinks": "Authorization headers in requests, credential variables, request headers, and request objects.",
  "flows": "Sources (credential functions, parameters) flow into headers and request objects via the auth handler and request preparation functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'mock.patch' within 'get_netrc_auth' is unusual for production but explicitly documented as a testing utility; no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages multiple authentication methods securely, with credential discovery and request augmentation. The use of 'mock.patch' is confined to testing contexts and is well-documented. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or data leakage are present. The credential handling and request modifications follow standard secure practices. The scores reflect low security risk and no malware suspicion, consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for IGWN authentication with no malicious intent. The use of 'mock.patch' is appropriate for testing and does not compromise security. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
