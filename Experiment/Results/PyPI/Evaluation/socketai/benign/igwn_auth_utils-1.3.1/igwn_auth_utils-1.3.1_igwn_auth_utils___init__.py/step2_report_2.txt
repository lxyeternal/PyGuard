  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements, license and author comments, and a version parsing block.\n- There are no functions, data processing, external input, or runtime logic.\n- The code imports modules related to authentication (X.509, SciTokens, Kerberos), error handling, HTTP requests, and versioning.\n- The version import includes a fallback for development mode, which is a common pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of no malicious or suspicious code.** The code is benign, serving as an import hub for authentication utilities.\n- **No data flow or input handling** to analyze.\n- **No malware, obfuscation, or security risks** are apparent.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious activity.\n- The version parsing with a try-except is standard and safe.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the logic or structure.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is only importing modules and setting a version string, with no runtime logic or external data handling, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n- The malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the clear, straightforward code.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies are observed. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a benign utility module that only imports other components related to IGWN authentication. There are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this accurately.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores should remain as they are: all zero, indicating no security concerns.",
