{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and imports for IGWN authorization credentials handling, including X.509, SciTokens, and Kerberos.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.error, .kerberos, .requests, .scitokens, .x509, ._version). No external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports functions and classes; there are no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The version parsing includes a fallback for development mode, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various utility functions and classes for handling authentication tokens and credentials. It includes a conditional import for versioning, which is typical in package setup. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward, modular, and only references internal modules with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for authentication handling with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate purposes related to credential management.",
