{
  "purpose": "Utility module for IGWN credentials and authorization, primarily handling discovery and management of X.509 credentials and SciTokens for HTTP(S) requests.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules related to error handling, Kerberos, requests, SciTokens, X.509, and version parsing.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only imports modules and sets version info.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static import setup with no data processing or external input.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import structure, no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version fallback, with no functions, data handling, or dynamic logic. It is a typical setup module for credential utilities. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The version parsing with a try-except is a common pattern. The code is benign and intended for organizing dependencies and version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility setup module with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
