  "purpose": "Utilities to facilitate use of IGWN authorization credentials, including X.509 credentials and SciTokens for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.error, .kerberos, .requests, .scitokens, .x509, ._version)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only imports functions and classes related to authentication and versioning.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and assigns version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of import statements and metadata comments. It loads various modules related to authentication, error handling, and versioning. There are no functions, data processing, or input handling present. The structure is straightforward, and all imports appear to be from local modules related to the package’s functionality. No malicious activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign initialization module for an authentication utility package. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, and the only activity is importing modules and setting a version string. The code appears to be safe and straightforward.",
