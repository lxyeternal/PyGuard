{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for IGWN authorization using credentials like X.509, SciTokens, and Kerberos for HTTP(S) requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.error, .kerberos, .requests, .scitokens, .x509, ._version) and version parsing.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; primarily importing modules and defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard license comments, author information, and straightforward imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module metadata, license information, author credits, and import statements. It imports functions and classes related to authentication, HTTP requests, and token handling from local modules. There is no evidence of code execution, dynamic imports, or untrusted data processing. The version import has a fallback for development mode. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module setup for authentication purposes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply organizes imports and metadata, with no indications of malware or suspicious behavior.",
