  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the accuracy of the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of import statements and metadata, with no active logic, data processing, or external input handling.\n- The code is standard for a utility module, importing various credential and request handling functions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity are evident.\n- The version parsing includes a fallback for development mode, which is common practice.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is benign, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; the scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, the report accurately describes the code as a straightforward utility setup.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected; scores are reasonable.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Similar to earlier; no active logic or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring matches the benign nature.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; the code is a typical utility module with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, given the code's benign nature, lack of external data processing, and no security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall assessment:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe utility module for credential handling, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate based on the code snippet.",
