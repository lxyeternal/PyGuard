  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements, license comments, author info, and a version import with a fallback.\n- No functions, data processing, or runtime logic are present.\n- No untrusted data sources, data sinks, or data flows are evident.\n- The code appears to be a module initialization or setup script for an authentication utility package.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** Correctly states the code is benign, with no malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is safe.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous; no malicious behavior or security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Same as previous; standard utility module, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is a straightforward import module with no active logic or data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, justified given the code's nature.\n\n**No issues or inconsistencies** are detected. The scores are reasonable and reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Confirmed as 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Confirmed as 0.\n- **Risk score:** Confirmed as 0.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no malicious or suspicious activity.** The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, well-structured utility module with no security concerns.",
