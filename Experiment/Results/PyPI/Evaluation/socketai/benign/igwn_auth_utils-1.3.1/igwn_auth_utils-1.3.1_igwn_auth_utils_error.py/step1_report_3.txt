  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module defining a custom exception class. It includes copyright information, licensing, author details, and a class with a docstring. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The class simply inherits from RuntimeError and adds a docstring, typical for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard definition of a custom exception with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
