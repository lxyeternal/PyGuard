  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for IGWN authentication errors.",
  "sources": "No data input/output, static class definition, metadata comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the class is standalone with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard structure and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static class inheriting from RuntimeError, with no dynamic code, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
