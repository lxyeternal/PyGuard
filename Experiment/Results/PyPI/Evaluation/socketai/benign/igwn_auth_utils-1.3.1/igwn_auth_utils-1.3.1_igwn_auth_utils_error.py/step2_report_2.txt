  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from RuntimeError.\n   - There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n   - The code does not perform any input/output operations, dynamic execution, or processing untrusted data.\n   - The class is straightforward, with appropriate comments and metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The reports are consistent in noting that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are identified; the code's purpose is clear and minimal.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Malware & Security Risk Justification**:\n   - Since the code only defines a custom exception class with no malicious behavior, malware score should remain at 0.\n   - Security risk is also 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n\n6. **Consistency & Final Estimation**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the current scores.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe, and benign class definition for a custom exception, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications needed. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
