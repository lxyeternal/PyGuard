  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code is a simple, standard Python class defining a custom exception (`IgwnAuthError`) inheriting from `RuntimeError`.\n   - It contains only metadata comments, author info, licensing, and the class definition.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or any suspicious constructs.\n   - The class does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it contain any logic beyond inheritance.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**:\n   - Given the straightforward nature of the code, there are no signs of malicious intent.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n   - The code serves as a benign, standard custom exception class.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate based on the code content.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Logical Flaws**:\n   - No issues are present; the code is a typical pattern for custom exceptions.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature and do not overstate risks.\n\n5. **Final Justification & Recommendations**:\n   - The risk score should remain at 0, as there's no security concern.\n   - Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set at 0.\n   - The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a minimal, standard, and benign exception class.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
