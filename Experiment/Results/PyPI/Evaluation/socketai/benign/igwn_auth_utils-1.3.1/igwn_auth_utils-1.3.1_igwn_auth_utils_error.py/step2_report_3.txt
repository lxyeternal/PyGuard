  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is a minimal, straightforward class definition for a custom exception inheriting from RuntimeError. It contains only metadata comments, author info, and the class itself. There are no data flows, input/output, or dynamic code execution. The code is benign and typical for Python exception handling.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. They correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition with no malicious intent. There are no logical flaws or misinterpretations evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1  \n   - obfuscated: 0  \n   - malware: 0  \n   - securityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores are consistent with the analysis. Since the code is trivial and safe, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   The highest scores are zero across malware and security risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports correctly state that the code is just a class definition with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent. No assumptions are made beyond the code's surface.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a benign, standard exception class with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the actual code content.",
