  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Code Content Confirmation:**\n- The code is a simple Python module defining a custom exception class `IgwnAuthError` inheriting from `RuntimeError`.\n- It contains only metadata comments, author info, licensing, and the class definition.\n- There are no data inputs/outputs, no dynamic code, no external modules, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n**Assessment of Report Logic and Reasoning:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- They note the absence of any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reasoning is consistent and thorough, with no logical flaws.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The `confidence` score is 1, which is reasonable given the clear and straightforward code.\n- The `purpose`, `sources`, `sinks`, `flows`, and `anomalies` are all correctly identified as non-problematic.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- No issues are present in the code, so no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely a class definition with no suspicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The risk score is 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard custom exception class.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are needed.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
