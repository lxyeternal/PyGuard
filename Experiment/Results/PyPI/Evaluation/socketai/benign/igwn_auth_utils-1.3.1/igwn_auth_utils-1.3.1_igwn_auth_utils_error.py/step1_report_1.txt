  "purpose": "Define custom exception for IGWN authentication utility errors",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal code defining a class",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow; code only declares a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external modules, declares a custom error class inheriting from RuntimeError, and contains only metadata comments and a class definition. No data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard pattern for custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
