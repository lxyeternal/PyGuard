  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple Python module defining a custom exception class `IgwnAuthError` inheriting from `RuntimeError`.\n- It includes standard comments, author metadata, and licensing information.\n- There are no data flows, input/output operations, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution.\n- The class is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Logical and scoring considerations:**\n\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there are no signs of malware.\n- The risk score is also 0, which is appropriate because the code doesn't introduce any security risk.\n- The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a benign exception class.\n\n**Potential for score adjustments:**\n\n- Since all evidence points to a benign, standard exception class with no malicious or obfuscated elements, the scores are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the current scores accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores are justified as they stand.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
