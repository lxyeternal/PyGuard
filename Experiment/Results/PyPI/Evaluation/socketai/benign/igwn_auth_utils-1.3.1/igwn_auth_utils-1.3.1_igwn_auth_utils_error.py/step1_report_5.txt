  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for IGWN Authentication utilities.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as the code only defines a class for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains comments, license, author info, and a simple class inheriting from RuntimeError. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The class serves as a custom exception with no logic beyond inheritance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
