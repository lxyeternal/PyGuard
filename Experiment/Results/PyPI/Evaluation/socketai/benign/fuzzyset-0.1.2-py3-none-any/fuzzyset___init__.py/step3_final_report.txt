  "purpose": "A fuzzy string matching utility using n-grams, cosine similarity, and Levenshtein distance for approximate string matching.",
  "sources": "Input strings processed in __add, __get, and _iterate_grams functions; external 'Levenshtein' library used for string distance calculations.",
  "sinks": "Results returned via __getitem__ and get methods; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are normalized and broken into grams, stored in data structures, and similarity scores are computed via cosine similarity and Levenshtein distance; results flow from source processing to retrieval functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard fuzzy matching algorithm with clear structure, no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks. It relies on common libraries and performs in-memory computations. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The external 'Levenshtein' library is a typical dependency for string distance metrics. The logic is correct, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified based on the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured fuzzy string matching utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
