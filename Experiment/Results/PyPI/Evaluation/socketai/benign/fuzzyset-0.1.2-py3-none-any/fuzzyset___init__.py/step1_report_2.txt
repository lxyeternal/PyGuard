  "purpose": "Implement a fuzzy string matching utility for approximate string matching using n-grams, cosine similarity, and optionally Levenshtein distance.",
  "sources": "Code reads input strings during initialization, adding items, and querying with __getitem__, get, and add methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data causes security issues; the code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed to generate n-grams, compare similarity scores, and retrieve matching strings based on computed metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code primarily performs string similarity computations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for fuzzy string matching, utilizing n-grams, cosine similarity, and optional Levenshtein distance. It involves processing strings, storing data structures, and performing similarity calculations. No external network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The use of Levenshtein is standard for fuzzy matching, not malicious. The code's structure is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or sensitive data. The functions operate locally, and the purpose is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a benign fuzzy string matching utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard data processing for string similarity comparison without any harmful side effects or malicious behaviors.",
