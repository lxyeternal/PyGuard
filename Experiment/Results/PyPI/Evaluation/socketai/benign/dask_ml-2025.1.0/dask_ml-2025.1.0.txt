      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Report 3's higher suspicion scores are justified by the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation patterns, indicating moderate malicious potential but no confirmed malicious payloads. Overall, the scoring and reasoning are consistent and appropriate, with a slight adjustment to emphasize suspicion in Report 3. The overall malware score for the set is around 0.3, reflecting moderate concern without confirmed malicious activity."

The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk primarily due to import practices. The code is standard for its purpose and does not pose security threats."

All signals and reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and should remain unchanged."

The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate (both 0). The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1-0.2) is conservative but acceptable; overall, the code poses minimal supply chain risk."
