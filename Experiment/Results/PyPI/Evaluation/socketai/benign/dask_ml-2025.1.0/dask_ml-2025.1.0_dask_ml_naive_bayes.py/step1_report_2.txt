  "purpose": "Implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using Dask for parallel computation and sklearn base class for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input arrays (X, y), environment variables (not explicitly used), and data passed to methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses data arrays internally; no direct sinks for untrusted data or system commands. No network or system modification code present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (X, y) through statistical computations, and predictions are made via internal likelihood calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses delayed and da for parallelism, but this is typical for Dask-based code. No obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using Dask for scalable computation. It reads data arrays (X, y), calculates class-specific means, variances, and counts using delayed computation, then predicts classes and probabilities based on these statistics. The implementation employs standard statistical formulas and Dask functions. No network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns detected. The use of Dask and sklearn interfaces appears legitimate and intended for scalable machine learning tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier leveraging Dask for parallel processing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It contains no network activity, backdoors, or privacy leaks. Overall, it is a typical, benign machine learning code snippet.",
