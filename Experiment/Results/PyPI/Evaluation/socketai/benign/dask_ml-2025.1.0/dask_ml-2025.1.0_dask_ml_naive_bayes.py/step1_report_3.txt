{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using Dask and scikit-learn frameworks for parallel processing and modeling.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters X and y for training, and method calls on X for predictions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted external data or output leaks are present; code primarily performs internal computations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y) through internal calculations (mean, variance, priors) to predictions or probability outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard machine learning computation methods with no obfuscated patterns or hidden code. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier with Dask for parallelized computation. It reads data through method parameters, performs typical statistical calculations (mean, variance, prior probabilities), and outputs classification results or probabilities. The implementation uses standard mathematical operations, delayed computation, and no external network interactions, external command calls, or suspicious file operations. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate machine learning model implementation following common patterns and practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs expected calculations for classification without suspicious or malicious actions.",
