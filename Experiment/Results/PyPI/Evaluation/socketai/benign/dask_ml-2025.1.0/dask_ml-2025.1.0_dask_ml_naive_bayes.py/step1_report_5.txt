  "purpose": "Implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using Dask for parallel computation, suitable for large datasets.",
  "sources": "Input data streams include X and y in fit(), as well as data passed to predict(), predict_log_proba(), and predict_proba().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks indicating malicious data leaks or network communication are present. No file writing or external system calls detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (X, y) through various computations, including means, variances, class priors, and likelihood calculations, without external or hidden data exfiltration paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual obfuscation. Use of delayed computation and Dask arrays is consistent with scalable ML workflows. No hidden or backdoor code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for Gaussian Naive Bayes leveraging Dask for scalable processing. It computes class statistics and likelihoods in a standard, transparent manner. Usage of delayed and Dask arrays appears appropriate for parallel computation. No network operations, file manipulations, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions and class methods serve typical ML purposes. The code seems clean and purpose-driven, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier utilizing Dask for parallel processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured ML component without security concerns.",
