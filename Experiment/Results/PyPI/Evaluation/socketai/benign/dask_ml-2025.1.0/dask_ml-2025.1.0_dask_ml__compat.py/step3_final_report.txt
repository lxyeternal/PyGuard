  "purpose": "Environment setup and utility functions for version compatibility and scoring validation in a data science/ML project.",
  "sources": "Version parsing lines, import statements, conditional flags, utility functions, context manager definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external output, or network communication.",
  "flows": "Imports and version checks establish environment flags; utility functions are called internally; no external data flows or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dummy_context as a fallback for contextlib.nullcontext; standard pattern, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup: importing libraries, parsing versions, defining compatibility flags, and utility functions. No data processing, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The dummy context manager is a common compatibility pattern. Version checks and conditional logic are standard. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting typical setup risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
