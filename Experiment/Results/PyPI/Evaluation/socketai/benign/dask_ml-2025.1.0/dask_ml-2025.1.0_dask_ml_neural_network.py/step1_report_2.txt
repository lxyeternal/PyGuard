  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the installation or setup of a Python package, possibly including configuration or initialization routines.",
  "sources": "Data sources include reading environment variables, importing modules, and potentially reading user input or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions and may reach sinks such as network calls, file operations, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual language features or dynamic code execution not evident. No suspicious external network calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed from start to finish. It imports standard modules and possibly third-party libraries. No suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The structure appears consistent with typical package setup or initialization scripts. No malicious code or unusual behavior detected. The lack of network activity or hidden code suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a normal package or module initialization purpose without any suspicious activity.",
