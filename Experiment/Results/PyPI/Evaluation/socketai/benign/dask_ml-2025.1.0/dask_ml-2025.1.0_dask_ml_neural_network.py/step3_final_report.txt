  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network communication, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, code execution functions, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources to code execution or network transmission, indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec on untrusted data, obfuscation patterns, suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials or URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical patterns of benign setup scripts with no suspicious activity. Suspicious patterns such as eval/exec, obfuscation, or unverified network communication raise moderate concern. The scores assigned in the reports reflect these observations: benign reports have zero malware and obfuscation scores, while Report 3 shows notable suspicion with scores of 0.4 (malware), 0.7 (obfuscated), and 0.65 (risk). These are justified given the patterns observed. The confidence levels are high where no suspicious activity is present, and slightly lower in the suspicious case, aligning with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Report 3's higher suspicion scores are justified by the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation patterns, indicating moderate malicious potential but no confirmed malicious payloads. Overall, the scoring and reasoning are consistent and appropriate, with a slight adjustment to emphasize suspicion in Report 3. The overall malware score for the set is around 0.3, reflecting moderate concern without confirmed malicious activity.",
