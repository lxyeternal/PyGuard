  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for scalable, incremental machine learning with scikit-learn and dask. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal concern due to deprecation notices and the complexity of distributed ML workflows."
