{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import necessary libraries for data processing with pandas, numpy, and dask.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines type variables for data structures and numeric types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only sets up type aliases and imports without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and type alias definitions intended for use in data analysis tasks involving pandas, numpy, and dask. There are conditional imports for compatibility with different numpy versions. No data processing, user input, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The structure and content are typical for type hinting and library setup in data science codebases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for type annotations and library imports with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and solely intended for defining data types.",
