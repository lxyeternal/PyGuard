  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a benign setup module for type aliases and imports related to pandas, numpy, and dask.\n- No data processing, input/output, or runtime logic is present.\n- The use of try-except for optional import is standard practice.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a very high confidence level (0.9 or 1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is purely to define type aliases and handle imports for data analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The scores for malware and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments to scores or reasoning are necessary.\n- The overall risk scores should remain at zero, given the benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless setup for type annotations.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
