  "purpose": "This code sets up import statements and type alias definitions for data structures used in data analysis with pandas, numpy, and dask, ensuring compatibility and clarity in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pandas, numpy, dask, and the optional numpy.typing.DTypeLike; type alias definitions for data structures and data types.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this code; it only defines types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for setting up type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for import and type alias setup, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication. The optional import for DTypeLike is a compatibility measure. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is safe, benign, and typical for a data analysis project setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup module for type annotations with no malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. All signals and reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
