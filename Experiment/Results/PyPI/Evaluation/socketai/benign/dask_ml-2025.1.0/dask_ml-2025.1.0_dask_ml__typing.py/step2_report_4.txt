  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily consisting of import statements, type alias definitions, and compatibility handling via try-except blocks.\n- No data processing, input/output, external communication, or runtime logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate setup for type annotations in a data analysis context.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident; the code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n- **Malware considerations:** The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware score should be 0.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly avoid basing claims on unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is benign, serving as a setup for type annotations and imports.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low (0).\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and no further action is necessary.",
