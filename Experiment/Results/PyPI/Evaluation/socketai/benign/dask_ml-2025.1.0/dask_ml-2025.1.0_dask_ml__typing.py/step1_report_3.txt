{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and imports for data processing with pandas, dask, and numpy",
  "sources": "None explicitly; code relies on standard library imports and external packages",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly type definitions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, conditional imports for numpy typing, and type alias definitions for data structures used in data processing tasks. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The conditional import for 'DTypeLike' is standard practice for compatibility and does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup module for type hinting and data structure aliases in a data analysis project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious setup of type aliases and imports for data processing libraries. It contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
