{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and imports for data processing with libraries such as pandas, numpy, and dask, to facilitate type checking and code clarity in data analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type alias definitions that do not process input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or data output occurs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines types and imports without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns are present. The try-except import fallback is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard data processing libraries and defines type variables for flexible use in larger codebases. The conditional import of DTypeLike indicates compatibility handling but does not execute runtime logic or data processing. No data ingestion, output, or external data handling is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for type annotations and library imports used in data analysis projects. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It appears purely as boilerplate configuration.",
