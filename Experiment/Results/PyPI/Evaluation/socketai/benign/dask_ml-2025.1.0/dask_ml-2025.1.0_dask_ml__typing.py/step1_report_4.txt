{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import modules for data analysis using pandas, numpy, and dask.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as dask.dataframe, numpy, pandas, and conditional import of numpy.typing.DTypeLike.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no output or network transmission code.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code only sets up type aliases and handles optional imports without executing any runtime data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type aliases and imports necessary modules for data analysis. It conditionally imports numpy.typing.DTypeLike, which is safe and standard. No dynamic execution, no data manipulation, and no external communication or input handling are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It appears to be a standard setup for type annotations and module imports in a larger data analysis project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for type annotations and module imports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
