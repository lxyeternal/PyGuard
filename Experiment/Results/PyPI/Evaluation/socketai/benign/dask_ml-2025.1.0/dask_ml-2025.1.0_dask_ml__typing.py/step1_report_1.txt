{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import statements for handling various data structures and types, primarily for data analysis and processing with libraries like pandas and dask.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing), third-party libraries (dask, numpy, pandas). No user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic. Use of try-except for optional import is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various data processing libraries and defines several type aliases for handling data structures like DataFrame, Series, numpy arrays, and dask arrays. It employs a try-except block for optional import of DTypeLike from numpy.typing, which is standard for compatibility. No data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. No indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The code appears to be part of a larger data processing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup for type annotations and imports in a data processing context. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
