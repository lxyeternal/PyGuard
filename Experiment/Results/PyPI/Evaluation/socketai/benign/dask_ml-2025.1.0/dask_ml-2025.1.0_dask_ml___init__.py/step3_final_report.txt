  "purpose": "Package initialization and version declaration, with an import from a private module likely for side-effects or internal registration.",
  "sources": "Import of '_normalize' from 'dask_ml.model_selection' and import of '__version__' from local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports with no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of private '_normalize' may trigger internal side-effects; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Import of private function '_normalize' and comment about 'registering tokenizers' without actual registration code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup snippet importing a private function and version info, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The import of '_normalize' is unconventional but not malicious. The comment about registering tokenizers is misleading but not security-related. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate due to the private import; malware score is 0; obfuscation is 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The minor concern about importing a private function is acknowledged but does not warrant a higher risk score.",
