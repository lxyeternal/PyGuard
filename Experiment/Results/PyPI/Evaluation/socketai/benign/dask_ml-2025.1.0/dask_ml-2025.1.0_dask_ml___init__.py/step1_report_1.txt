{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package's initialization or version management, ensuring that the package version is registered and accessible.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'dask_ml.model_selection' and internal version module '_version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from external package and internal version assignment, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Comment about registering tokenizers but no related code present; import from 'dask_ml' is standard and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a normalization function from 'dask_ml.model_selection' and the package's version info. The comment suggests a potential concern about registering tokenizers, but no such operation is present. The import appears to be standard and does not involve untrusted data or code execution. The __all__ declaration exposes only the version string. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initialization snippet with no evidence of malicious behavior. It imports a standard library component and exposes the version. No security risks are apparent.",
