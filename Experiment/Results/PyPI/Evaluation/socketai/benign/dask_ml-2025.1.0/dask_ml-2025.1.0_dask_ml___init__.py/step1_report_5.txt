{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import a normalization function from the dask_ml library and define the package version for export.",
  "sources": "Importing _normalize from dask_ml.model_selection",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data outputs that process untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Comment mentions registering tokenizers but no related code present; import statement uses a private function (_normalize), which is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports a private function _normalize from the dask_ml library, which might be used internally for normalization purposes. It also imports the package version from a local module. The use of a private function (_normalize) could be considered unconventional or risky if it leads to instability or unintended behavior, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute any suspicious behavior. Overall, it appears to be standard setup code with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily setup and import statements with no malicious behavior detected. The only unusual aspect is importing a private function, which does not indicate malicious intent but is noteworthy.",
