{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate synthetic datasets for machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering, using sklearn, numpy, and dask for scalable data handling.",
  "sources": "Data is generated internally via random number generators (numpy, sklearn), with parameters controlling data characteristics; no external data sources or network inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into dask arrays and dataframes; no external data exfiltration, network communication, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Random generators produce data that are stored in dask structures; no external sinks or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of np.random.seed in make_classification_df and random_date functions is noted but is standard practice for reproducibility; no malicious anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for synthetic data creation, with proper use of random states for reproducibility. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Minor seed handling inconsistencies are benign and typical in such utilities. The functions serve legitimate purposes in ML workflows without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent utility for generating synthetic datasets for machine learning, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
