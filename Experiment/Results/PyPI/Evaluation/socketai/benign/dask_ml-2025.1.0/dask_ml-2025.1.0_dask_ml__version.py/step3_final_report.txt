  "purpose": "Define static version metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and version tuple; conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The version string '2025.1.0' is set in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static version metadata snippet with conditional type checking imports. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples, with no external data, dynamic code, or obfuscation. The version '2025.1.0' is in the future but does not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to benign, standard practice code. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version metadata snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The future version number is unusual but not problematic. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
