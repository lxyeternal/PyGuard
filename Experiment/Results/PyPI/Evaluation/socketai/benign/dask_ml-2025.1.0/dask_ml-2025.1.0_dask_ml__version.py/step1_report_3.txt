{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a package using setuptools_scm, with no operational logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; purely static assignment",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded version string '2025.1.0', but this is a common practice for versioning and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, with conditional type checking imports. No external data reading, no network activity, no execution of untrusted code. The hardcoded version is typical for release management and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version definition code for Python packages with no malicious or security concerns identified. It does not perform any operations that could harm or leak data.",
