  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a straightforward version metadata setup, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables.\n- Conditional type checking imports are standard for static type hints.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or obfuscation is present.\n- The version number is '2025.1.0', which is in the future, but this alone isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of static version strings and tuples:** No issues or anomalies.\n- **Conditional type checking import:** Standard practice, no security concern.\n- **No external data or untrusted sources:** Verified.\n- **No obfuscation or suspicious constructs:** Verified.\n- **No malicious behavior or security risks:** Confirmed.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the version number '2025.1.0' being in the future, which could indicate a misconfiguration or typo, but it does not pose a security risk.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the static nature and lack of vulnerabilities, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for Risk Score:\n- The code is static, does not process untrusted data, and has no malicious intent.\n- The only anomaly is the future version number, which is not inherently risky but might be a mistake.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n- The version number being in the future is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard version metadata snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor point is the future version number, which warrants a review but does not impact security.\n\nPlease proceed with this understanding for any further analysis.",
