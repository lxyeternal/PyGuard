  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables.\n- Uses conditional type checking imports, which are typical.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or obfuscated constructs.\n- The version string is '2025.1.0', which is in the future but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is straightforward and benign.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Data leaks or untrusted data:** None.\n- **External interactions:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Version info setup, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Same as above; identical reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Same reasoning; static version info, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same as above; no malicious activity, just version info.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Slight note: version '2025.1.0' is in the future, which might be unusual but not malicious.\n- No external data or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- The only minor point is the future version number, which is not a security concern but might be worth noting as unusual.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese align with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this version metadata code. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
