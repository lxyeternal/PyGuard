  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for version tracking and compatibility.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, based on hardcoded version values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leak points or external data effects.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to variables, static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution, no hidden behavior, no hardcoded credentials other than version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static definition of version variables, generated by setuptools_scm. It uses conditional typing imports, which are standard and do not introduce malicious behavior. The version string and tuple are hardcoded as '2025.1.0' and (2025, 1, 0), respectively. There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or external sources. The code’s purpose is solely version management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely for version declaration purposes, with no malicious or security issues detected.",
