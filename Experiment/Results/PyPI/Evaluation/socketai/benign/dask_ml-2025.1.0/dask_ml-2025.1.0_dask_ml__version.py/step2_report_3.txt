  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version metadata assignment, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No external inputs, untrusted data, or dynamic behaviors are involved.\n- The version string is hardcoded as '2025.1.0', which is in the future but not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk is also 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is solely to define version variables for package management.\n- The use of conditional type checking imports is standard and not suspicious.\n- The version string being in the future (2025) is unusual but not malicious; it could be a placeholder or a planned release version.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.\n\n**Scores and conclusions:**\n- The reports' scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are all 0, justified by the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The static version string, even if future-dated, does not impact security.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe version metadata snippet with no security concerns.",
