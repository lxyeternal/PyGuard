  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and manages version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, version_tuple, version_tuple__).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward variable assignments with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard version metadata setup with static strings and tuples. No obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version management script generated by setuptools_scm. It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables, with conditional type checking imports. No external inputs, user data, or untrusted sources are involved. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve solely for version control within the package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard version metadata code, with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity.",
