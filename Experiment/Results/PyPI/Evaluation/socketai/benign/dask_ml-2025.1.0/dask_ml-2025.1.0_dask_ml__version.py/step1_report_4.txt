  "purpose": "Define version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm, used for package management and version tracking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to version-related variables; no flow of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded version string ('2025.1.0') which is static; no obfuscation, suspicious variables, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining version metadata for a package. It uses conditional typing imports that are typical for type checking and static analysis. No dynamic code execution, no external data input, no cryptic or obfuscated logic. The version number appears static and not derived from external sources. No potential security or malicious issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version metadata assignment with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a benign component of package versioning.",
