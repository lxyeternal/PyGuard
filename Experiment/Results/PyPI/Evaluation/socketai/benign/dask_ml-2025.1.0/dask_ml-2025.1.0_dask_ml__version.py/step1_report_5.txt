{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related metadata for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from hardcoded assignment and type-checking imports, but no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data assignments are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The version number is set to '2025.1.0', which is in the future; however, this is not inherently malicious, just unusual. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version information with static strings and type annotations, including a conditional import for type checking. No external input, network activity, or sensitive operations are observed. The version being in the future could be a mistake or intentional for upcoming releases but does not indicate malicious intent. The structure and content are straightforward and standard for version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
