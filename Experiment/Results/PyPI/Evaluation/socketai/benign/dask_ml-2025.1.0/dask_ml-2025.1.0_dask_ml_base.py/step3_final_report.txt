{
  "purpose": "Provides data validation and scoring mixins for scikit-learn-compatible estimators, ensuring input data correctness and model evaluation metrics.",
  "sources": "check_array, check_X_y, _check_y functions, and internal data flow within validation and scoring methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing validated data, and calls to accuracy_score and r2_score for model evaluation.",
  "flows": "Input data is read via check_array, check_X_y, or _check_y; then passed to scoring functions; validated data flows into return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard sklearn validation utilities for data checking and model scoring. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The functions are straightforward, and the logic aligns with typical ML validation patterns. The scoring methods use standard metrics with no external or hidden operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of validation and scoring mixins for machine learning estimators. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate (both 0). The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1-0.2) is conservative but acceptable; overall, the code poses minimal supply chain risk.",
