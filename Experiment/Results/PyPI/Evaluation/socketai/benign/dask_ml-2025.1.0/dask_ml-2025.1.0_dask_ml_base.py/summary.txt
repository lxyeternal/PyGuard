  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of validation and scoring mixins for machine learning estimators. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate (both 0). The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1-0.2) is conservative but acceptable; overall, the code poses minimal supply chain risk."
