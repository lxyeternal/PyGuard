  "conclusion": "The code snippet is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which is a style issue rather than a security vulnerability. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk primarily due to import practices. The code is standard for its purpose and does not pose security threats."
