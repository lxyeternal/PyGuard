  "purpose": "Minimal setup for distributed training of an XGBoost model using Dask, intended for cluster-based execution.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'dask_xgboost' package.",
  "sinks": "None; no data or untrusted input/output operations present.",
  "flows": "Import statement initializes the package; no data flow or execution logic shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *', which is discouraged but not malicious; no other unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import with a descriptive docstring, serving as a setup for distributed ML training. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The reliance on an external package is standard; the wildcard import is a style concern but not security-related. No data handling, network activity, or credential use is evident. The package 'dask_xgboost' is open-source and widely used, but its integrity should be verified separately. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with typical distributed ML workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which is a style issue rather than a security vulnerability. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk primarily due to import practices. The code is standard for its purpose and does not pose security threats.",
