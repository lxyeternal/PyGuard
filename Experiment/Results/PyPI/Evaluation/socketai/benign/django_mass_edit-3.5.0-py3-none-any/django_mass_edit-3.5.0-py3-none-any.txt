The scores are appropriate, and the primary recommendation is to fix the URL pattern duplication to prevent routing conflicts."

      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure DEBUG setting and dynamic SECRET_KEY generation, which are typical for development environments. These are configuration issues rather than security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting insecure production practices but no malicious intent."

The duplicate URL pattern is a configuration issue but not a security concern. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and security risk is minimal. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."
