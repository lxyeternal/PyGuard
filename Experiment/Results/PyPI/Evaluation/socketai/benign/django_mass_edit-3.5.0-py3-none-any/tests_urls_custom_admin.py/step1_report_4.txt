  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for a Django application, including custom admin sites and third-party admin package integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django URLs, admin modules, and custom admin site; URL pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "Django URL resolution system which handles incoming HTTP requests and directs them to appropriate views or admin interfaces.",
  "flows": "Incoming requests to 'custom_admin_path/' or 'admin/' are routed to either custom or default admin views based on URL patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. The inclusion of third-party 'massadmin' and custom admin site configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines URL patterns for the Django project. It integrates a third-party admin package ('massadmin') and a custom admin site instance. The URL configuration routes requests to these admin interfaces accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. All code appears consistent with typical Django admin configuration. No unusual or suspicious code structures are present. No input/output handling, user data processing, or insecure patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration for admin interfaces, including a custom admin site and a third-party package. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security posture appears safe based on the provided code.",
