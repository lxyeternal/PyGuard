  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for Django admin sites, including a custom admin site and massadmin integration, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django URLs, django admin, massadmin URLs, and custom admin site; URL pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; URL patterns are static configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Duplicate URL path 'custom_admin_path/' may indicate configuration redundancy but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up URL routes for Django admin and a custom admin site, integrating massadmin. It imports necessary modules and registers URL patterns, including a duplicate path for 'custom_admin_path/' which might be redundant but not malicious. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard configuration for testing admin site compatibility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration script for Django URL routing with no malicious activity detected. The duplicate URL pattern could be a minor oversight but does not pose security concerns.",
