  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for Django admin sites, including a custom admin site for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for URL configurations, including custom admin site and massadmin URLs; URL patterns defined in the urlpatterns list.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily sets up URL routing and does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only defines URL patterns and imports modules without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard Django URL configuration for testing custom admin integration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for URL routing and sets up URL patterns for both the default admin and a custom admin site. It uses include() with kwargs to pass the custom admin site to massadmin URLs, and defines direct paths for the custom admin and default admin sites. There are no signs of code injection, external data processing, or malicious code. The purpose seems limited to testing the integration of a custom admin site in a Django project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward URL configuration for Django admin sites, intended for testing purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It is safe.",
