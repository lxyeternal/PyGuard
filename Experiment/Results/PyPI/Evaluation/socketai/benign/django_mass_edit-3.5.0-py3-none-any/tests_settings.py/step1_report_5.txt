  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django web application, including secret key generation, template settings, installed apps, middleware, database configuration, and URL routing.",
  "sources": "The SECRET_KEY is generated dynamically using uuid4().hex at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The generated SECRET_KEY is used for cryptographic signing within Django, but since it's generated at runtime, it does not pose a direct security risk.",
  "flows": "The SECRET_KEY flows from generation to application use for cryptographic signing; no other external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is generated dynamically at startup, which is unusual for production environments where a fixed secret is preferred. The code contains duplicate 'MIDDLEWARE' and 'MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES' definitions, which is redundant but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module. It generates a SECRET_KEY at runtime using uuid4().hex, which provides a unique key per startup but can cause issues with session persistence if the server restarts. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. The duplicate middleware definitions are redundant but harmless. No external data sources or unsafe code execution is observed. The configuration appears standard, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings configuration with dynamic secret key generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is the non-persistent SECRET_KEY, which could affect security practices but is not malicious.",
