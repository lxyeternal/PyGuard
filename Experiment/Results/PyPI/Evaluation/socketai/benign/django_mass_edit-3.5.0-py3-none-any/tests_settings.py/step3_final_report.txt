  "purpose": "Django application configuration settings, including secret key generation, debug mode, installed apps, middleware, and database setup.",
  "sources": "uuid4().hex for SECRET_KEY, static configuration values, no external inputs or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Generation of SECRET_KEY at module load time using uuid4().hex; DEBUG=True in settings; redundant MIDDLEWARE definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module primarily for development purposes. SECRET_KEY is generated dynamically at load time, which causes a new key on each restart, leading to session invalidation—acceptable for dev but insecure for production. DEBUG=True is also a development setting that should be disabled in production. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data flows are present. The configuration is benign but not suitable for production deployment due to insecure settings.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure DEBUG setting and dynamic SECRET_KEY generation, which are typical for development environments. These are configuration issues rather than security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting insecure production practices but no malicious intent.",
