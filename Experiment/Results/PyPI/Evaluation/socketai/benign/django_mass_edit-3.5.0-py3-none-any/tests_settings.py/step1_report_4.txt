  "sources": "uuid4().hex generating SECRET_KEY",
  "sinks": "SECRET_KEY used as a secret token; no other untrusted data sources present.",
  "flows": "uuid4() generates a new UUID each time, used for SECRET_KEY, no external or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is dynamically generated at runtime using uuid4().hex, which is unusual for a static secret key in a production environment. DEBUG is set to True, which can be risky for production, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django configuration with dynamic SECRET_KEY generation, typical settings, and standard middleware/apps. No external inputs are processed, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are found. The use of uuid4() for SECRET_KEY might lead to inconsistent key across restarts but is not malicious. The overall setup appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings module with dynamic secret key generation and no malicious intent. The only concern is the use of DEBUG=True, which is insecure in production, but it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
