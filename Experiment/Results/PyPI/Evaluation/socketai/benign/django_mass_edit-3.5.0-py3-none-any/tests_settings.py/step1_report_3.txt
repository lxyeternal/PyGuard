  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django web application, including secret key generation, templates, installed apps, middleware, and database configuration.",
  "sources": "Generation of SECRET_KEY via uuid4().hex at the start of the code.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the uuid4().hex is used solely for secret key generation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid4().hex for SECRET_KEY is generally acceptable, but generating a new secret key at each startup can invalidate sessions and security tokens. The code repeats 'MIDDLEWARE' as 'MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES', which is redundant but not malicious. The configuration is mostly static and typical for Django.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Django settings, generating a SECRET_KEY dynamically with uuid4().hex, which is a common practice for development or testing environments but not recommended for production due to security implications. No user input is processed, and no untrusted data is handled in ways that could lead to injection or data leaks. The presence of 'DEBUG=True' indicates a development environment, reducing security risks but not eliminating them. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or supply chain attacks are detected. The code appears to be standard Django configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings module for development purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The use of uuid4() for SECRET_KEY is acceptable in testing but not recommended for production. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
