  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure DEBUG setting and dynamic SECRET_KEY generation, which are typical for development environments. These are configuration issues rather than security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting insecure production practices but no malicious intent."
