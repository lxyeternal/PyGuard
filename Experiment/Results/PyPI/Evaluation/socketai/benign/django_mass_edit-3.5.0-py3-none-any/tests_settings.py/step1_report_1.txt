{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a Django web application, including secret key generation, templates, installed apps, middleware, and database settings.",
  "sources": "Generation of SECRET_KEY using uuid4().hex; potential reading of environment variables or external inputs is not present.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling evident; configuration values are static or generated internally.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs; secret key is internally generated and static settings are used.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid4().hex for SECRET_KEY may result in predictable keys if the code is reused or not regenerated, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets other than the generated UUID; debug mode enabled, which is insecure for production.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module, setting up app configurations. The SECRET_KEY is dynamically generated at module load time, which is acceptable for development but insecure for production. Debug mode is enabled, increasing vulnerability surface. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or malicious behavior are present. The code does not include any network activity, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django settings file primarily intended for development, with no evidence of malicious intent. The main security concern is the DEBUG=True setting, which should be disabled in production. The secret key is generated dynamically and is not hardcoded, reducing risk. Overall, the code is benign but not suitable for production without modifications.",
