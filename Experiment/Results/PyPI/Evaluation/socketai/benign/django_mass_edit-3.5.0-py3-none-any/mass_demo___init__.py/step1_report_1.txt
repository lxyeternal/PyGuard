  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function or task, which is not explicitly stated in the code snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, function arguments, or possibly external files (depending on the specific code, which is not shown here).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communication functions, file write operations, or data output functions where untrusted data could cause harm or leakage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like network operations or file writes, possibly passing through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution were observed. The code appears straightforward based on the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard Python structures with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign, and there are no evident backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. The flow from data input to output points is typical, with no suspicious activity detected. Lack of explicit network connections or system modifications suggests low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no suspicious or harmful constructs identified.",
