  "purpose": "Analyze the open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, potential dynamic code execution (e.g., eval), network operations, file handling.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points, network connections, environment variable access, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file system), possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious variable names, obfuscation, use of eval or exec, hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively indicate that most code appears benign with low obfuscation and no malicious activity. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation (score 0.7) and some suspicion of dynamic code execution, leading to a moderate malware score (0.3). The other reports correctly assign low scores, consistent with their descriptions. The scores align well with the observed patterns; no significant inconsistencies are evident. Given the suspicion in Report 2, a slightly higher malware score (e.g., 0.4) could be justified if explicit evidence of malicious code is confirmed, but as described, 0.3 remains appropriate. Overall, the assessments are reasonable, and the scores reflect the evidence provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign with no confirmed malicious activity. Suspicious patterns in Report 2 justify moderate concern, but without concrete malicious payloads, the overall risk remains low. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no major revisions are necessary.",
