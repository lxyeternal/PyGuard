  "purpose": "Define Django models for testing or administrative purposes with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Model class definitions, CharField and ForeignKey declarations, no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; models are static data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static model definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward Django model classes with CharFields and ForeignKey relations, all within an app labeled 'tests'. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The models are simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code appears intended for testing or development purposes, with no indications of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious Django models module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
