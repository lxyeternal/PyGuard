  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "targets": "No data outputs or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; models are standard ORM definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The models appear to be straightforward Django ORM classes with no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Django ORM model class definitions with simple CharField and ForeignKey fields. All classes specify the app_label 'tests', indicating they are part of a test or development setup. There are no external input sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation. The models are typical for a Django project and do not present any security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django model definitions without any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to serve as a simple data schema for testing or development purposes.",
