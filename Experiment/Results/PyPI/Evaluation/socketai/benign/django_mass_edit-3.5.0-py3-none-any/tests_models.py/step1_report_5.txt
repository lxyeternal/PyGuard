  "purpose": "Define Django models for administrative and data management purposes within a 'tests' app.",
  "sources": "Model field definitions, ForeignKey relationships, class Meta declarations.",
  "sinks": "Database operations via Django ORM, model instantiations, and field access.",
  "flows": "Model creation and data input flow into database via Django ORM; foreign key relationships establish data integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or unusual behaviors, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Django model class definitions with standard field types and metadata. It defines several models with CharFields and a ForeignKey relation, all within a specified app label 'tests'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The models appear to serve straightforward data storage purposes, and no untrusted inputs or external data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django models module intended for basic data modeling without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and follows standard Django practices.",
