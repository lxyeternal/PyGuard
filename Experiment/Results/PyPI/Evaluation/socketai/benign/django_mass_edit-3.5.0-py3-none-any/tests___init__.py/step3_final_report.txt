{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python file containing only a coding declaration (e.g., '# coding: utf-8') with no executable code.",
  "sources": "The comment line '# coding: utf-8' itself; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only a comment with no runtime execution or data movement.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable logic, data processing, or suspicious patterns; only a comment line present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a comment specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no functions, variables, or logic. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code poses no threat in supply chain security context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal encoding declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
