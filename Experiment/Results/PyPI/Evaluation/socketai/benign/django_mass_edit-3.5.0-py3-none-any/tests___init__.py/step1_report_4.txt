  "purpose": "The code snippet appears to specify the encoding for the Python source file.",
  "sources": "The encoding declaration at the top of the file ('# coding: utf-8')",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "No data flow is present; the snippet only specifies encoding",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a comment indicating UTF-8 encoding, with no executable or functional code present",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a single comment line declaring UTF-8 encoding. It does not include any logic, input handling, or data processing. As such, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. It is a standard file encoding declaration often used in Python scripts. Since the code is only this comment, there are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or anomalies beyond the trivial encoding declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign encoding declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. There is no suspicious activity or vulnerability present in this snippet.",
