  "purpose": "Configure and expose the WSGI application for deploying a Django web project.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting (os.environ.setdefault), Django module import, get_wsgi_application() call",
  "sinks": "get_wsgi_application() initializes the WSGI application; environment variable setting influences application behavior",
  "flows": "os.environ.setdefault sets DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE -> get_wsgi_application initializes application based on settings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code structures; standard Django deployment setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django WSGI configuration script. It sets the environment variable for Django settings, imports the WSGI application factory, and creates the application object. No user input, no untrusted data sources, no external network calls, and no code obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The setup aligns with standard deployment practices and does not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Django WSGI configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It simply prepares the application for deployment.",
