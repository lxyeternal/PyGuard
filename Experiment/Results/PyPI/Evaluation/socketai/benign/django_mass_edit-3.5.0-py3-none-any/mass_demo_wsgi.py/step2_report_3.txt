  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a standard Django WSGI configuration script.\n- The code sets the environment variable `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, imports `get_wsgi_application`, and exposes the application callable.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious logic, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks, is identified.\n- The code aligns with typical deployment practices.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears clean, standard, and free of anomalies.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities based on the provided code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely configuration without any malicious or vulnerable components, a risk score above 0.5 isn't justified.\n   - The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No malicious behavior detected.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly identify the code as standard.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a straightforward, standard Django WSGI configuration with no security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is benign and poses no security risk. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
