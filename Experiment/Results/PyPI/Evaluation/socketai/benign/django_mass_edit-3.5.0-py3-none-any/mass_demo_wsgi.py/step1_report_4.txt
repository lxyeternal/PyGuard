  "purpose": "Configure and expose the WSGI application for a Django web project.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting (os.environ.setdefault) and module import (os, django.core.wsgi).",
  "sinks": "Potential environment variable influence on application configuration.",
  "flows": "The environment variable setting influences the behavior of get_wsgi_application, but only within the intended configuration scope.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments detected. The code is standard for Django deployment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for WSGI configuration, sets a default environment variable for Django settings, and initializes the WSGI application object. All elements follow standard Django deployment practices. No data is read from untrusted sources at runtime, nor are there any evident data leaks or malicious code injections. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or execute dynamic code. It appears to be a typical, straightforward WSGI setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django WSGI configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the environment and exposes the application callable as intended. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
