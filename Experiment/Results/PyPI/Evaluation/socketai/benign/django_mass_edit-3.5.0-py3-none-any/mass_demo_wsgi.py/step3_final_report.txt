  "purpose": "Standard Django WSGI configuration script for deploying the application.",
  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault setting the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable, import of get_wsgi_application, assignment to application.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The environment variable setting and import lead to the application callable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django WSGI setup, setting environment variables, importing necessary functions, and exposing the application callable. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard deployment script with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
