  "sources": "Environment variable setting ('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE') and import statements for Django modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variables are set but not sourced from untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting influences Django's configuration during application startup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, imports the WSGI application object, and exposes it as 'application'. These are standard practices for deploying Django projects. No user input, network activity, or insecure coding practices are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a typical deployment configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard WSGI configuration script for a Django project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
