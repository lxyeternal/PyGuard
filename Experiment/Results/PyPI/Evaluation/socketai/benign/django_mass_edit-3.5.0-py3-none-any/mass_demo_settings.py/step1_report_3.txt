  "purpose": "Django project settings configuration for 'mass_demo' including security, database, templates, and application setup.",
  "sources": "Reads secret key from hardcoded string, environment variables not used, and loads settings from the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of SECRET_KEY if code is shared, but no dangerous data sinks like network transmissions or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "No external input flows directly into sensitive parameters; static configuration is used.",
  "anomalies": "DEBUG mode enabled; SECRET_KEY hardcoded; 'ALLOWED_HOSTS' is empty, potentially insecure for deployment; 'DEBUG' should be False in production.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Django settings with no evidence of malicious code or backdoors. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is insecure for production, but this is a common practice in development. 'DEBUG' mode is on, which can expose sensitive information if used in production. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The settings file does not perform any actions beyond configuration. No external data sources, inputs, or sinks are detected that could lead to malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Django settings file with no malicious code or supply chain security issues. Its insecure configurations (hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True, empty ALLOWED_HOSTS) suggest it's intended for development, not production. No malware or security risks are detected based on the code provided.",
