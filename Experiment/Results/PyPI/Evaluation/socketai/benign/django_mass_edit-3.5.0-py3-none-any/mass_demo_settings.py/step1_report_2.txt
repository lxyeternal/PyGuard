  "purpose": "Django project settings configuration for a development environment",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname, SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, TEMPLATES, ALLOWED_HOSTS, INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE, DATABASES, LANGUAGE_CODE, TIME_ZONE, STATIC_URL",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external input processing present in the code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; static configuration values are used directly",
  "anomalies": "SECRET_KEY is hardcoded and not environment-variable secured; DEBUG mode enabled in settings (unsafe for production); ALLOWED_HOSTS is empty (default); insecurely configured for production deployment",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static configuration settings typical for a Django development environment. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which can be a security concern if used in production. DEBUG mode is enabled, indicating this setup is not suitable for production. No user input handling, data processing, or external data flows are present. No external dependencies or suspicious library usage is detected. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are evident. The overall configuration aligns with development practices, with some insecure defaults that should be changed for production.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings file intended for development, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG being enabled, which are typical for development but unsafe for production environments. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
