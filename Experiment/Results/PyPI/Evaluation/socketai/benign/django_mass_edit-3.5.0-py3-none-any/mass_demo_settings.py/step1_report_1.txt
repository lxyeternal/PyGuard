  "purpose": "Django project settings configuration for mass_demo, including security, templates, database, and middleware setup.",
  "sources": "import os, SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, TEMPLATES, ALLOWED_HOSTS, INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE, DATABASES, and other configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flows are present that could lead to leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from static variables and environment settings to Django framework components, but no untrusted sources influence these flows.",
  "anomalies": "Security warnings are present, notably DEBUG set to True and SECRET_KEY hardcoded, which are insecure for production but not malicious. No backdoors, hidden code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is standard Django configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Django settings with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials beyond SECRET_KEY (which is typical but insecure for production), and no external data inputs influencing behavior. The DEBUG flag is enabled, which could expose sensitive information if deployed in production, but this is a development setting. No suspicious patterns, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure and content align with common Django project configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical Django settings file with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It contains insecure configurations suitable only for development but does not exhibit malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior.",
