{
  "purpose": "This code is a Django settings configuration file intended for development purposes, containing insecure defaults such as a hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG mode enabled.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data within the settings file; no untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; configuration values are static and not influenced by external inputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code is purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of insecure defaults (hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True, empty ALLOWED_HOSTS) but no malicious or obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. The insecure defaults are typical for development but pose security risks if used in production. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3 due to insecure defaults, which are not malicious but should be addressed before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django configuration file intended for development, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The insecure defaults are typical for development environments and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
