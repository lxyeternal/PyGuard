  "purpose": "Django project configuration settings, primarily for development purposes.",
  "sources": "Configuration variables such as SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, database path, and template settings.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct untrusted data outputs or dangerous data sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; configuration values are static and defined within the file.",
  "anomalies": "SECRET_KEY is hardcoded in plaintext, which is insecure for production. DEBUG mode is enabled, which is unsafe for production. No external input processing or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings file with typical configurations. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which could be a security risk if used in production. DEBUG mode is enabled, which can expose sensitive information if the server is accessible externally. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present. The code uses static paths and standard Django components, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django settings configuration intended for development. It does not contain malicious code or behavior but is insecure for production due to DEBUG being true and the SECRET_KEY being hardcoded. No malicious activity or malicious code intent is detected.",
