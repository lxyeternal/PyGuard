  "purpose": "Django project configuration settings for 'mass_demo', including security, templates, database, and middleware setup.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration variables such as SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, and database settings; importing os for path management.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of SECRET_KEY, DEBUG mode being True, and database path in a public environment; no direct data sinks like network connections or file writes with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables are set from static code; no dynamic or user input flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "SECRET_KEY is hardcoded in plain text; DEBUG mode is enabled which is insecure for production; no external input is used for sensitive configurations. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard Django settings with default configurations. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is a security risk in production but not malicious per se. DEBUG mode is enabled, which can expose sensitive information if used in production. Database setup uses local SQLite, common for development. No external inputs, environment variables, or network operations are present. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical development configuration file for a Django project with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True, which should be addressed before deployment. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
