{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass that mocks rendering of a mass change form in a web application, likely for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs are explicitly read; the code only receives parameters passed to the method render_mass_change_form.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or output effects that process untrusted data or perform actions like network requests, file writing, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Parameters received by render_mass_change_form are directly returned in a dictionary without processing, validation, or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. It is a simple override method for mocking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and extends it with a mock method that returns the input parameters in a dictionary. It appears to serve as a test or placeholder implementation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. No external data sources, sinks, or flows that could lead to security issues are present. Overall, the code is benign and intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mocking subclass for testing rendering logic with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or handle untrusted data in a vulnerable manner.",
