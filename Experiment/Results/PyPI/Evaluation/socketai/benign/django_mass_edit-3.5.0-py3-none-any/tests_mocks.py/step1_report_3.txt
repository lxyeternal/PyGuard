  "purpose": "This code defines a mock class for testing or development purposes, inheriting from MassAdmin to override a rendering method.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: request, context, add, change, form_url, obj.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or database operations are present; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into the returned dictionary; no external or untrusted sources are involved in a malicious context.",
  "anomalies": "The class is a mock implementation, which is common in testing; no suspicious or malicious code, such as obfuscated logic or hidden backdoors, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a package, defines a subclass overriding a method to return a dictionary containing the input parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection. The purpose appears to be to facilitate testing or mocking in a development environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign mock subclass used for testing or development purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
