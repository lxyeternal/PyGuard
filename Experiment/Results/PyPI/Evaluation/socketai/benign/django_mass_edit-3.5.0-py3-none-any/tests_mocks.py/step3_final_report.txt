{
  "purpose": "A mock subclass overriding a method to return input parameters as a dictionary, used for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "Method parameters: request, context, add, change, form_url, obj",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transmission or processing occurs",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into the return dictionary without external effects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior; straightforward mock implementation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that overrides a method to return its input parameters as a dictionary, serving as a mock or test stub. It contains no malicious logic, external calls, or data leaks. The code is simple, clear, and intended for testing purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given its benign nature. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mock implementation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate low risk scores. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for testing environments.",
