{
  "purpose": "This code imports all contents from the demoparser2 module and sets module documentation and export list accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .demoparser2",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports a module and assigns attributes",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can obscure imported symbols, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a relative module 'demoparser2' and assigns its documentation to the current module's '__doc__'. It also conditionally copies the '__all__' attribute if present. This pattern is typical for module re-exporting or proxying. No code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The wildcard import may hide potentially malicious or unintended symbols but is common in package interfaces. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious data flow are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module wrapper or proxy, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard import is a style issue but not inherently malicious.",
