  "purpose": "Re-export symbols from the sibling module 'demoparser2' by importing all its contents and assigning its documentation and __all__ attributes to the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .demoparser2 import *', access to 'demoparser2.__doc__', and 'demoparser2.__all__' if present.",
  "sinks": "Attribute assignments to '__doc__' and '__all__' within the current module; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Importing all symbols from 'demoparser2' as source; assigning 'demoparser2.__doc__' and 'demoparser2.__all__' to current module attributes as sink.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can lead to namespace pollution; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward re-export pattern, importing all symbols from a sibling module and copying documentation and symbol list. No data flows into external systems, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation are present. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not a security threat. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the minimal risk and style concern. The code is benign and functions as a simple proxy or re-export module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'import *' is a style issue but does not constitute a security risk. The current scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
