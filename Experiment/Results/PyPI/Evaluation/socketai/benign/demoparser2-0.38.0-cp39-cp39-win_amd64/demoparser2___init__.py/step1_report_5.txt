{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the demoparser2 module and sets module documentation and __all__ attribute accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .demoparser2",
  "sinks": "None present; no data or input processing or untrusted data handling detected",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .* import *' which can obscure actual imported content; no explicit anomalies or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of all symbols from a local module demoparser2, then assigns the module's documentation string to the current module's __doc__. It conditionally copies the __all__ attribute if it exists. There is no evidence of code execution, dynamic code evaluation, or data leaks. The import style is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior or anomalies are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module wrapper that imports symbols from demoparser2 and sets documentation and export list accordingly. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code snippet.",
