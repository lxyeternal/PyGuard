  "purpose": "To parse dependency requirements from files for installation, using readlines() wrapped in brackets, resulting in nested lists.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'requirements-dev.txt' files via open() and readlines() functions.",
  "sinks": "Dependency installation process that consumes REQUIREMENTS and REQUIREMENTS_DEV lists.",
  "flows": "File reading -> list assignment with nested lists -> dependency installer processing the nested lists.",
  "anomalies": "Use of brackets around readlines() causing nested list structures; potential for runtime errors during dependency resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code reads requirements files with 'readlines()' wrapped in brackets, creating nested lists (e.g., REQUIREMENTS = [reqs.readlines()]), which is likely unintended. This could cause dependency installation failures, but it does not introduce malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code structure is otherwise standard and benign. The nested list bug is a minor code quality issue rather than a security concern. The overall security risk is minimal, but the bug could impact functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a minor bug in dependency list handling that could cause installation issues but poses no security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score should be low (~0.05 to 0.1) to reflect the bug's potential impact on dependency parsing. Correcting the list assignment to REQUIREMENTS = reqs.read().splitlines() would resolve the issue.",
