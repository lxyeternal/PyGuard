{
  "purpose": "This code loads version control metadata generated by 'versioneer.py' for tracking package version information.",
  "sources": "The 'version_json' string containing version metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code only reads static data.",
  "flows": "The 'get_versions' function loads and parses the static JSON string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and only processes static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'json' module, defines a static JSON string with version info, and provides a function to parse and return this data. The JSON content is hardcoded and static, with no user input, environment variables, or external data sources involved. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident; the code appears to serve a benign purpose of version information retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only parsing static version data without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
