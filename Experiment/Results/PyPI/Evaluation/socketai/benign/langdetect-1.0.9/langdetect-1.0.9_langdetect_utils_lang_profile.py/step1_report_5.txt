{
  "purpose": "This code defines a language profile class for analyzing text based on n-grams, likely used for language detection or similar NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Input text via the update() method, which processes string data; regex matching on n-grams.",
  "sinks": "The code updates internal dictionaries and counters, no direct data leaks or untrusted outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> normalization -> n-gram extraction -> frequency update in internal dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to perform standard NLP processing.",
  "analysis": "The code creates and manages a language profile with n-gram frequencies. It uses regular expressions to filter certain characters, updates counts with input text, and removes low-frequency n-grams. There are no network operations, dynamic code execution, or suspicious file manipulations. The use of six library for compatibility and the standard use of regex are typical. No anomalies or malicious behavior are apparent in the logic or structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP utility class for managing language n-gram profiles. No malicious intent or malware indicators are present.",
