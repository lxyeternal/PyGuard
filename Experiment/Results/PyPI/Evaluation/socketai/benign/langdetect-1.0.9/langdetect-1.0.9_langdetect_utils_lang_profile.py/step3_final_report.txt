{
  "purpose": "A class for managing language profiles based on n-gram frequency analysis, used for language detection or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input text processed via update() method, specifically through normalization and character addition.",
  "sinks": "No external data outputs or network interactions; internal data manipulation only.",
  "flows": "Input text → normalization → n-gram generation → frequency update and filtering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard NLP utility for language profiling, utilizing regex for filtering alphabetic characters, frequency counting, and noise removal. It does not perform any external communication, dynamic code execution, or contain obfuscated code. The methods are straightforward, and the logic aligns with typical language detection algorithms. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of standard libraries and patterns indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a language profile utility with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. All signals point to a safe and straightforward NLP component.",
