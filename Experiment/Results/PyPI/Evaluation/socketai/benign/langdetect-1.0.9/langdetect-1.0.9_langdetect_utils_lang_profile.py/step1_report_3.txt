{
  "purpose": "The code defines a language profile class for n-gram analysis, intended for linguistic or language detection purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is obtained from the 'text' parameter in the 'update' method, specifically the 'text' argument passed to the method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external sources, network, or filesystem. It manipulates internal data structures only.",
  "flows": "Text input flows through 'update', where it is normalized and processed into n-grams, which are then stored in internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code does perform regular expression matching, but only for linguistic analysis. There is no code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a language profile, adding n-grams extracted from input text. It uses regular expressions for language-specific character filtering and updates internal frequency counts. The 'omit_less_freq' method removes low-frequency n-grams and noise, which is standard in language profiling. No external calls or dangerous operations are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a legitimate linguistic processing class.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs language profiling through n-gram analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is safe and intended for language processing tasks.",
