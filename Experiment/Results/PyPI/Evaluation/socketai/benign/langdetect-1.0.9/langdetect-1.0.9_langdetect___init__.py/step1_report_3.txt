  "purpose": "This code imports functions and classes related to language detection from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.detector_factory' and '.lang_detect_exception' modules, which likely read code files or data within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or external input handling is observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from these import statements alone; no source-to-sink flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements from local modules. It references functions and constants related to language detection. There are no signs of data manipulation, malicious code, or security risks within these imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward module imports without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. It appears to be part of a larger language detection package. No security issues are detected based on this fragment.",
