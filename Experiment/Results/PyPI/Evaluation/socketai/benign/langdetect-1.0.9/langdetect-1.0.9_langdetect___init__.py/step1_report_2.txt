{
  "purpose": "The code imports components from local modules related to language detection, likely for use in language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .detector_factory and .lang_detect_exception.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observable in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions and classes related to language detection and exception handling from local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, no external network activity, and no suspicious code. The imported functions suggest this code is part of a language detection feature, and nothing in this fragment indicates malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, serving as an import of language detection modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on these import statements.",
