{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and classes related to language detection from local modules, likely for language analysis purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from .detector_factory and .lang_detect_exception modules; these are local module imports, not external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward import statements with no unusual syntax, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports components from local modules, indicating modular design for language detection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is standard for Python projects and does not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, consisting solely of import statements for local modules related to language detection. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
