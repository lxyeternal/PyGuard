  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules related to language detection.\n- No data processing, external network activity, or suspicious behavior is identified.\n- The code appears to be standard, modular Python code for a language detection library.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are noted.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1), and malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets provided are minimal import statements, and there is no evidence of malicious activity or security issues.\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, there is no reason to adjust the scores or challenge their conclusions.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score remains at 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign import statements with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
