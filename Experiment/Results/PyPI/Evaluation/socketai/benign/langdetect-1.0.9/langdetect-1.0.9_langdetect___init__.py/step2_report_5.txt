  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules. There are no signs of data processing, network activity, or malicious code within this snippet.\n   - Confirmed: No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the provided code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, the risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n   - No justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is correct given the code's benign nature.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or malware behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the import statements as part of a language detection library.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are based on unsupported assumptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is straightforward import statements for a language detection library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
