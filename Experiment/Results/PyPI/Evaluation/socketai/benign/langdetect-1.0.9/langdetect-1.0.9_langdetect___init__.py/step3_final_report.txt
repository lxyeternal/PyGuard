  "purpose": "Import statements for language detection modules and exception handling within a Python package.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: .detector_factory and .lang_detect_exception",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import statements",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or execution beyond imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements from local modules related to language detection. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is standard, modular, and benign, with no external interactions or dynamic execution. The high confidence scores (1) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified based on the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, representing standard module imports for a language detection library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
