  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nfrom .detector_factory import DetectorFactory, PROFILES_DIRECTORY, detect, detect_langs\nfrom .lang_detect_exception import LangDetectException\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code snippet:**\n- It contains only import statements from local modules.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The imported modules relate to language detection and exception handling, typical for such a library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward import statements, with no evidence of malicious or insecure behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  None. The code appears standard and benign.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity evident)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (correct; no security issues)\n\n### Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is only importing modules related to language detection.\n- No suspicious activity, data leaks, or external interactions are present.\n- The scores assigned (all zero or one with high confidence) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are consistent with each other.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- Since the code is only import statements, there is no reason to increase malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code snippet is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the minimal nature of the code.",
