  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules related to language detection.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external interactions are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are reported or observed.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of a language detection library, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, standard import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward local module imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Standard import statements, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same benign pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a minimal set of import statements, which are typical in modular Python projects.\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports or the code indicates malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** The code is benign; no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no security concerns.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the context of the entire project; this snippet alone appears safe, but comprehensive security assessment should include the full codebase.",
