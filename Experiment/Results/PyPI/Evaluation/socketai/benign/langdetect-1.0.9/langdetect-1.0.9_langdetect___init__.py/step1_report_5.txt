  "purpose": "Importing modules and functions related to language detection and exception handling",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: detector_factory and lang_detect_exception",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from import statements alone; these are static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual imports, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing specific functions and constants from local modules. There are no data manipulations, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The imported functions appear to be related to language detection, and the exception class indicates error handling for language detection processes. This is a standard import pattern without any suspicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely import statements for local modules related to language detection and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within these lines. It appears to be a legitimate setup for a language detection feature.",
