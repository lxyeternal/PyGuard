{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'langdetect' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and importing setup functions from setuptools or distutils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content used as long_description during setup; no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The license mismatch in classifiers (Apache License vs. MIT) is a metadata inconsistency but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup routine: it attempts to import setup from setuptools, falls back to distutils if unavailable, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are detected. The only notable point is the license classifier mismatch, but this is a metadata issue, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package info and configures the package build process. No malware, backdoors, or security threats are present.",
