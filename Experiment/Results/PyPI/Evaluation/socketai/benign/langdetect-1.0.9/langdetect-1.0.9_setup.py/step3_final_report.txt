  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'langdetect' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; imports 'setup' from setuptools or distutils.",

  "flows": "Reads local file; no external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "License classifier states 'Apache' while license field states 'MIT'—metadata mismatch.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious code. The only anomaly is the license mismatch, which is a metadata inconsistency and not a security issue. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The license mismatch is a metadata issue, not a security concern.",
