{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'langdetect', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; reads package metadata directly within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; all data sources are static files or hardcoded strings.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md into variable 'readme' and passes it to setup() as long_description; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code uses standard practices for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if necessary, then reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All actions are standard for Python package distribution. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious activities are evident. The dependencies are minimal and relevant. The classifiers and metadata are typical and do not indicate tampering.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors identified.",
