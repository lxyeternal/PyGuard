{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'langdetect' Python package, used to specify package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, importing setup from setuptools or distutils, and static metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing identified; no data leaks or security-sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "The script reads local files and sets package metadata; no untrusted data flows or external network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The license listed as 'MIT' but classifier states 'Apache', which is inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including importing setup, reading a markdown file for description, and defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, input handling from untrusted sources, or network operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It safely defines the package metadata for distribution.",
