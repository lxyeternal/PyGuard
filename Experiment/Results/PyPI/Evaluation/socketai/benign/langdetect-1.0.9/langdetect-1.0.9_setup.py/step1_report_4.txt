{
  "purpose": "To set up the 'langdetect' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads file content and passes static data to setup configuration; no flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The license is listed as 'MIT', but the classifiers mention 'Apache Software License', which is inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package. It conditionally imports setup from setuptools or distutils, reads a README.md file, and then calls setup() with static package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no input from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no malicious behavior observed. The code appears to be legitimate and typical for package distribution. The inconsistency between 'license' ('MIT') and the classifier ('Apache') is noted but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a conventional package configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
