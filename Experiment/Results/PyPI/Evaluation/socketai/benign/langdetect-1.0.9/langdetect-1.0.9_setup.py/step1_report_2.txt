  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'langdetect' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' → setup configuration; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It conditionally imports setup functions, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data manipulation is present. The code adheres to common packaging practices and does not contain any apparent malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
