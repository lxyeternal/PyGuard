  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The only noted inconsistency is the license classifier ('Apache') vs. the 'license' field ('MIT'), which is a metadata mismatch but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup configuration.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external data flow, no obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.\n- **Score adjustments:** Looks appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning applies.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, only metadata inconsistency.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated to 0.1, possibly due to the license mismatch, but this is a metadata issue, not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** Reasonable; no change needed.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusions.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the license mismatch as a metadata concern, not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.1; the slight metadata inconsistency does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The minor metadata inconsistency is not a security concern.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The reports are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
