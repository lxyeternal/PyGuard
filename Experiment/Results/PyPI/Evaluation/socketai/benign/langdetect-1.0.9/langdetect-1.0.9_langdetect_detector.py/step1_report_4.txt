{
  "purpose": "The code implements a language detection algorithm based on n-grams, allowing appending text, cleaning, and probabilistic language identification.",
  "sources": "Reads input text via the append() method; uses regex patterns to identify URLs and email addresses; accesses word-language probability map; uses random seed for probabilistic calculations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to manipulated input data if malicious data influences probabilistic calculations, though no direct data leakage or external network actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input text → cleaning and normalization → n-gram extraction → probabilistic updates using random-based iterative process → output of detected language.",
  "anomalies": "Uses random.gauss() and random.choice() seeded with self.seed, which is typical for probabilistic methods but may be manipulated if seed is externally controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration code detected. No suspicious URL or email pattern handling beyond standard regex matching.",
  "analysis": "The class performs language detection primarily through probabilistic analysis of n-grams extracted from input text. It includes regex-based cleaning for URLs and emails, normalization of text, and probabilistic modeling with optional prior knowledge. The use of randomness in the detection process appears to be part of a standard iterative statistical method, not malicious. No network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration functions are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of language detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard language detection algorithm that processes input text, extracts n-grams, and probabilistically determines language without any malicious behavior. Use of randomness and regex-based cleaning are normal for this domain. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious payloads is present.",
