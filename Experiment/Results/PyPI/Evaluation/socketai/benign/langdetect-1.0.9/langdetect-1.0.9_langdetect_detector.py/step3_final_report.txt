{
  "purpose": "The code implements a probabilistic language detection system using regex cleaning, n-gram extraction, and Bayesian-like probability updates. It aims to identify the language of a given text.",
  "sources": "Input text provided via the append() method, which processes and cleans URLs and emails, then extracts n-grams for analysis.",
  "sinks": "Internal probability calculations and debug print statements; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Text input → cleaning (regex removal) → n-gram extraction → probability initialization → iterative probability updates with random sampling → final probability normalization and sorting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of randomness for probabilistic inference, seed control for reproducibility, and verbose debug output. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard language detection procedures with regex cleaning, n-gram analysis, and probabilistic inference. No external communication, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Randomness is typical for such models, and debug outputs are benign. The code structure is clear, and regex patterns are standard. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected. The minor use of randomness and verbose debug statements could, in theory, leak internal state if misused, but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source language detection implementation with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's behavior.",
