  "purpose": "The code implements a language detection tool that analyzes input text to identify its language based on n-gram analysis and probabilistic models.",
  "sources": "Input text provided to the append() method, especially from external sources; data read from text argument in append() and possibly from external files when loading profiles.",
  "sinks": "Probability calculations, updates of language probabilities, and normalization functions which process and potentially leak data through probabilities; no external network or system interaction is explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input text -> text cleaning and n-gram extraction -> probability initialization and updates -> normalized probabilities -> detection output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.gauss for probability variation; no hardcoded credentials; code appears standard for language detection. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual control flow detected. Use of regular expressions for URL and email detection is typical, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a language detection class that processes input text by removing URLs and emails, extracting n-grams, and updating probabilistic models to infer language. It uses randomness in its iteration process but only for probabilistic variation, which is normal for statistical models. The process involves probability normalization, sorting, and optional verbose output. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation code is present. The use of external libraries like six is standard, and no suspicious code patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a language detection algorithm with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions solely as a probabilistic classifier based on input text and internal models. The presence of randomness is typical for such models. No malware or security risks are evident.",
