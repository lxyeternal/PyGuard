{
  "purpose": "This code is a language detection utility that analyzes text to determine its language based on n-gram models and probabilistic methods.",
  "sources": "URL and email address regex matches, input text appended via the append() method, and text normalization functions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly designed for malicious data leakage or external data transmission; no direct network or system calls for malicious purposes are present.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through URL/email regex cleaning, normalization, n-gram extraction, and probabilistic language inference processes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random seed setting and multiple trials for probabilistic stability; no obvious anomalies in code structure; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a language detector by cleaning input text, extracting n-grams, and applying probabilistic models to estimate language likelihoods. It incorporates standard practices for text normalization, regex-based cleaning, and probabilistic updates. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are evident. The only notable aspect is the use of randomness to improve detection stability, which is benign in this context. The code appears to be a legitimate language detection implementation with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard language detection implementation with no malicious behavior or supply chain security threats detected. It performs text processing, probabilistic analysis, and n-gram extraction in a typical manner. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious code embedded within this module.",
