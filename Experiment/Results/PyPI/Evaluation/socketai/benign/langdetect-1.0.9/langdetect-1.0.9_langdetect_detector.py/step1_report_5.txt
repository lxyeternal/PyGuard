{
  "purpose": "This code implements a language detection algorithm that analyzes input text to identify its language using n-gram models and probability calculations.",
  "sources": "URL_RE and MAIL_RE regex patterns for detecting URLs and emails; input text via the append() method.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No data is sent over network, stored insecurely, or interacts with external systems beyond internal processing.",
  "flows": "Input text is sanitized by regex substitutions, normalized, and then processed through n-gram extraction and probabilistic updates to determine language probabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.gauss for stochastic variation in probabilities; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, but reliance on randomness could obscure deterministic behavior if seed is predictable.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs language detection through n-gram analysis, probabilistic modeling, and optional prior probabilities. The use of regex for URL and email removal is straightforward. Random seed is set from the factory, but the seed value itself isn't shown here. No external network communication, system manipulation, or data exfiltration observed. The only minor concern is the randomness in the detection process which could be exploited if seed is predictable, but this is part of probabilistic language detection and not malicious. Overall, no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a language detection module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard probabilistic language identification using n-grams, with normal processing and no external harmful interactions.",
