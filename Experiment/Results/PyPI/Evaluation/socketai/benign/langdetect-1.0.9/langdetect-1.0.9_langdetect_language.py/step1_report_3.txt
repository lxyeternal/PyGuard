{
  "purpose": "This class is designed to store information about a detected language, including its code and probability, and to support comparison and representation functions.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) takes 'lang' and 'prob' as input parameters. The __repr__ method reads 'self.lang' and 'self.prob'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output functions present. No data leaks or insecure operations identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (lang, prob) flows into object instantiation. The __repr__ method reads internal attributes for representation. Comparison operators read 'prob' for sorting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code appears straightforward and typical for a data container class.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a simple data container for language detection results, including initialization, string representation, and comparison. All methods use straightforward attribute access without external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The class's functionality is standard and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data structure with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as intended for storing and comparing language detection results without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
