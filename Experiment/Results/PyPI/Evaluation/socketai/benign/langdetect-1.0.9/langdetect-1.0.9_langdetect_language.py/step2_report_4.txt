  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided code defines a simple class `Language` that stores language code and probability, with methods for representation (`__repr__`) and comparison (`__lt__`). The class appears to be a straightforward data container used in language detection systems.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The class is syntactically correct and functions as intended. No issues with the logic or implementation.\n- **Malicious behavior:** There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risks:** No external data handling, no network access, no environment variable usage, no secrets or credentials embedded.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The code is minimal and standard. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a benign data class with no external dependencies, no network operations, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly agree on its harmlessness.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the scores provided in the reports:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere are no signs of security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The code is a standard, harmless data container.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the code is purely a data structure, it does not introduce any security risks.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 across all categories are appropriate.",
