{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'Language' used to store detected language information, including language code and probability, likely for use in a language detection system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; only class initialization parameters 'lang' and 'prob' are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or processing; no sinks are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code only defines a data structure with no external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward data container with methods for representation and comparison based on probability. It includes no external data handling, no network communication, and no suspicious code constructs. The methods are simple and serve typical purposes in data modeling. The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign data container class with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as part of a larger language detection system but does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
