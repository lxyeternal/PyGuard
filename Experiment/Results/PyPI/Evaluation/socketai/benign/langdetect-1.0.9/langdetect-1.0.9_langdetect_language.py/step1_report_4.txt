{
  "purpose": "The class is designed to store information about a detected language, including its probability, and provides methods for representation and comparison.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'lang' and 'prob' parameters during initialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to security effects; no external data handling or output beyond string representation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'lang' and 'prob' flow into the object during instantiation; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class with basic methods for representation and comparison. It does not include any external data handling, network access, or system modification features. The class appears to be part of a larger language detection system but itself contains no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a data structure for language detection results. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
