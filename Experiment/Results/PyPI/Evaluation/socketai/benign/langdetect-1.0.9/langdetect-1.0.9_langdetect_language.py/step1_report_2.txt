{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple class to store detected language information with probability, likely used as part of a language detection system.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; the class receives data through constructor parameters 'lang' and 'prob'.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks or output functions; the class provides string representation and comparison methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to object attributes and then used in __repr__ and __lt__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Language class with basic attributes and methods for comparison and string representation. It appears to serve as a data container. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or environment variable usage. It is simple and typical for a data model class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data structure for representing language detection results. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
