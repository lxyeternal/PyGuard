  "purpose": "Store detected language information with probability for language detection systems.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class attributes are set during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instantiation to representation and comparison methods; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class 'Language' with attributes 'lang' and 'prob'. It includes methods for string representation and comparison based on probability. The code is clear, with no external dependencies, network calls, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The class serves as a basic structure within a language detection system, and all indicators point to benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
