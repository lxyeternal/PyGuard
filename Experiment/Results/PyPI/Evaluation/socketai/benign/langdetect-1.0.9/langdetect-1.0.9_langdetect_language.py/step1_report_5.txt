  "purpose": "The class is designed to store and represent detected language information, including language code and probability, for use by a language detector.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to or send data to external destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; the class merely stores data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a simple data structure with methods for initialization, string representation, and comparison based on probability. There are no external data inputs, no processing of untrusted data, and no side effects or external communications. The code is straightforward and does not include any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data container class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
