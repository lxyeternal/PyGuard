{
  "purpose": "The code defines an NGram class for text normalization and processing, specifically for handling Unicode characters, language-specific normalization, and generating n-grams for language analysis.",
  "sources": "Uses messages.get_string() for retrieving configuration strings and data from the messages module; processes input characters via add_char() method.",
  "sinks": "None of the code segments explicitly handle untrusted data or perform operations like network communication, file access, or execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input characters are normalized via add_char() which calls normalize(); normalized characters are added to the n-gram buffer; no external data flow to network or system functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code performs Unicode normalization and mapping based on pre-defined data. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles Unicode normalization and linguistic data processing, utilizing messages.get_string() to load configuration strings. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, network operations, or code injection. The class manages language-specific normalization rules and mapping, which appears standard and benign. The use of external messages module for strings might be a security consideration if the data were malicious, but that is not evident here. The code is well-structured for linguistic processing without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a language normalization and n-gram processing module. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The use of external configuration strings does not introduce security concerns based on the provided code. Overall, the code is safe with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
