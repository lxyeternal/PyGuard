  "purpose": "Unicode normalization and language processing for multilingual text, constructing n-grams, and mapping characters based on Unicode blocks.",
  "sources": "Input characters via add_char method, external message strings for configuration and character mappings.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or system modifications; internal data processing only.",
  "flows": "Characters are normalized, stored in internal buffers, and used for n-gram extraction; external message strings provide configuration data for character mappings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external message strings for configuration is typical; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Unicode-aware normalization, language-specific character mapping, and n-gram construction. It relies on external message strings for configuration, which is standard for localization. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, and no external system interaction occurs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Unicode normalization utility with no signs of malicious or obfuscated content. The low risk scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment confirms its safety for use.",
