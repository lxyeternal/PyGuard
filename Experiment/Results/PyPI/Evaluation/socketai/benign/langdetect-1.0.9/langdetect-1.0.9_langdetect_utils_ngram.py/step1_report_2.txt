{
  "purpose": "The code implements an NGram text processing class that normalizes and extracts n-grams from Unicode text, with particular focus on multilingual and special character normalization.",
  "sources": "Imports modules 're' and 'six', and utilizes external 'messages' and 'unicode_block' modules for string resources and Unicode categorization.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks or data output points involving untrusted data are evident. The code processes strings locally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input characters into normalized forms, stored in class attributes, and methods generate n-grams based on these normalized strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code heavily relies on external message resources for Unicode normalization mappings; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing n-grams with normalization for various Unicode blocks, including Latin, Arabic, CJK, Hangul, and Vietnamese. It normalizes characters based on Unicode block classification, potentially replacing or mapping characters to standard forms. The 'messages' module supplies string resources used for character mappings, which are externalized and not hardcoded. No network operations, code execution, or data leakage mechanisms are present. No suspicious functions or behaviors are evident; the logic appears to be standard text normalization and tokenization for multilingual support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a Unicode-aware n-gram processing utility with extensive normalization tailored for multilingual text. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. All external dependencies are for resource strings and Unicode classification, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent.",
