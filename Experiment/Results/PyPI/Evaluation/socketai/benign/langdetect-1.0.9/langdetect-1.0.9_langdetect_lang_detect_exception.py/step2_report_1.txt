  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a dictionary `_error_codes` mapping error names to integers.\n- Creates a class `ErrorCode` dynamically via `type()` with these attributes.\n- Implements a custom exception `LangDetectException` that stores an error code and message, with a method to retrieve the code.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code is straightforward, defining constants and a simple exception class.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n- Use of `type()` for dynamic class creation is standard and not inherently malicious.\n- The exception class merely stores data and provides access.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description and the reports' analysis.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Potential errors or flaws:\n- None identified. The code is clear and standard.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.5 seems reasonable; no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is purely defining data structures and a class for error handling.\n- No external dependencies, inputs, or outputs.\n- No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n### Overall assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code, I concur with the given analysis. The code is a standard, benign implementation of error handling for language detection errors, with no security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis reflects the absence of malicious or suspicious elements in the code.",
