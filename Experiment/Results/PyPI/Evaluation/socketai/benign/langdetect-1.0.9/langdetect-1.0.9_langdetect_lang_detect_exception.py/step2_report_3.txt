  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code provided, and evaluate the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- Defines a dictionary `_error_codes` mapping error names to integers.\n- Creates a class `ErrorCode` dynamically from `_error_codes`.\n- Defines a custom exception `LangDetectException` that stores an error code and message.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both correctly scored as 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is standard, with no external data or malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment, appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No issues; the code is standard, with no external data or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid, well-reasoned, and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states the code is standard, with no external data or malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** No external inputs, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is a standard error handling setup.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements, and the reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring. The code is a typical implementation of error codes and exception handling, with no security concerns. The assessments are justified, and no adjustments are needed.",
