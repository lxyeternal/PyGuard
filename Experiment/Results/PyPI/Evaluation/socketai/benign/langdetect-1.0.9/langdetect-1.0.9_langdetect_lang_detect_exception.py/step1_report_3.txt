{
  "purpose": "Define a set of error codes and a custom exception class for language detection errors.",
  "sources": "The dictionary '_error_codes' providing error mappings, and the class 'LangDetectException' which reads 'code' and 'message' during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'code' attribute stored in 'LangDetectException' could be accessed or transmitted, but there are no sinks that lead to data leaks or external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Error code values are assigned to an attribute of the exception object. There are no external data flows, network calls, or I/O operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code follows standard conventions for defining constants and custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of error codes mapping error names to integers, then dynamically creates an 'ErrorCode' class with these codes as attributes. It also defines a custom exception 'LangDetectException' that stores an error code and message. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. There are no external data sources, no network communication, and no sensitive information handling beyond error codes and messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, standard implementation of error codes and a custom exception class, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
