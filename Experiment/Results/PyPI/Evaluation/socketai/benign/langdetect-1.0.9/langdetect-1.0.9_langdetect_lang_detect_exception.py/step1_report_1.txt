  "purpose": "Define error codes and a custom exception class for language detection errors.",
  "sources": "The dictionary '_error_codes' used as the source for error code mappings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks, as it only defines data structures and a class.",
  "flows": "The code maps error names to codes and creates an exception class that can be raised with a message and code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of error codes, then dynamically creates an ErrorCode class from it, and a custom exception class that stores an error code and message. The exception class provides a method to retrieve the code. There are no inputs from external sources, no external network calls, or other suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard error handling setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for error handling related to language detection, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is simple, clear, and appropriate for its purpose.",
