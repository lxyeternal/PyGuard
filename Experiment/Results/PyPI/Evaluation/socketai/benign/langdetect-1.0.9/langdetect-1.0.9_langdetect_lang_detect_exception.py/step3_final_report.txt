{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of error codes and a custom exception class for language detection errors.",
  "sources": "Error code dictionary and class attributes, error message and code in exception constructor",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted input processing",
  "flows": "Error code dictionary to class attributes; exception stores code and message",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard setup for error handling, defining constants and a custom exception. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'type()' for dynamic class creation is benign. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate error reporting within a language detection module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should be maintained.",
