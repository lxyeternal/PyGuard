  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports step-by-step.\n\n1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:\n- The code is a straightforward definition of error codes and a custom exception class. No external data, network calls, or dynamic inputs are involved.\n- The code appears clean, with no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is standard error handling setup.\n\n2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is simple, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n\n3. Review the scores given to each issue:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n- These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5. All are zero, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. Pay close attention to the malware score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard error handling.\n- No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n\n7. Make sure the scores are consistent with the report:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, safe implementation of error code definitions and a custom exception class. The reports are accurate and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n- Overall, this is a non-issue from a security perspective.",
