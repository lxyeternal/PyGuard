  "purpose": "Define error codes and a custom exception class for language detection errors.",
  "sources": "The dictionary _error_codes that stores error name-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "The constructor of LangDetectException that passes a message to the base Exception class.",
  "flows": "The error code and message provided to LangDetectException are stored and retrieved within the exception object; no external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be standard error handling and class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary with error names and codes, dynamically creates an ErrorCode type, and implements a custom exception class that stores an error code and message. There are no external inputs, network communications, or suspicious constructs. The use of type() to create ErrorCode is a common pattern for lightweight class creation. Overall, the code performs straightforward error handling setup with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of error codes and a custom exception class for language detection errors. It shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
