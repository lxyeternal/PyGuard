{
  "purpose": "Defines error codes and a custom exception class for language detection errors.",
  "sources": "The dictionary '_error_codes' providing error code mappings, and the constructor of 'LangDetectException' which accepts code and message as input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data processing, output, or external communications occur in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (error code and message) flows from instantiation of 'LangDetectException' to setting 'self.code' and retrieving via 'get_code()' method.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. Use of dynamic type creation with 'type' is typical and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of error codes, creates a type 'ErrorCode' dynamically from this dictionary, and implements a custom exception class that includes an error code attribute. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, nor external communications. The code structure is straightforward and standard for error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard implementation of error codes and a custom exception class for language detection errors. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
