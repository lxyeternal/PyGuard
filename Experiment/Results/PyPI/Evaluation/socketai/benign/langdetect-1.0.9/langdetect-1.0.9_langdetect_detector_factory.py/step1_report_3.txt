{
  "purpose": "This code implements a language detection library that loads language profiles from a specified directory or JSON data, constructs language detectors, and performs language detection and probability calculations.",
  "sources": "File system (loading profile files from 'profiles' directory), JSON data input (via load_json_profile method), and text input for detection functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write untrusted data to external sources, send data over the network, or access sensitive system information directly. No sinks are present for untrusted data causing leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Profile files are read from disk and parsed into language profiles; text inputs are processed by detector instances to determine language or probabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior such as hardcoded credentials, network communication, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code follows standard patterns for loading profiles, creating detector objects, and performing language detection.",
  "analysis": "The code manages language profile loading either from files or JSON strings, constructs detector instances, and performs language detection. It uses standard libraries, safely handles file operations with proper exception handling, and uses class methods appropriately. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code does not contain any network communication, obfuscated logic, or potentially harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard language detection implementation with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely handles file input, JSON parsing, and object creation without any suspicious or malicious code. The overall security risk is low.",
