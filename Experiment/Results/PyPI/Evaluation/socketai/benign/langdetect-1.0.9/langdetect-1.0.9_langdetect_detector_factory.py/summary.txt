  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure language detection library with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to reliance on external profile data, which could be malicious if tampered with, but the code itself remains safe."
