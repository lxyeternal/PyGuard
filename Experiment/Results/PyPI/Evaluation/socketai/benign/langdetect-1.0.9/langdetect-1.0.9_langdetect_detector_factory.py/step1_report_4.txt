{
  "purpose": "The code defines a language detection framework that loads language profiles, creates detectors, and detects the language of input text.",
  "sources": "The code reads profile files from the 'profiles' directory, loads JSON data from files or strings, and reads input text via detector.append().",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data could be passed into detector.append(), but no direct untrusted source is explicitly used for dangerous actions. No sinks like network or file output are present.",
  "flows": "Profiles are loaded from files or JSON strings into LangProfile objects, which are then added to internal maps. Detectors are created and used to process input text, with no external or untrusted data flows leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No unusual code patterns are observed. The code uses standard libraries and conventions. No obfuscated code detected. Exception handling is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code loads language profiles from files or JSON strings, constructing internal data structures for language detection. Profiles are stored with probabilities for words of length 1-3. Detectors are instantiated with optional smoothing parameter. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code operates within typical language detection logic, relying on external profile data. Exception handling is standard, and no insecure patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate language detection component that loads profiles and creates detectors. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured, and its behavior is consistent with intended functionality.",
