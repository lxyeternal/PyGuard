{
  "purpose": "This code provides a language detection framework that loads language profiles, manages detectors, and detects the language of input text.",
  "sources": "Loading profile files from a directory, reading JSON profiles, and input text passed to detect and detect_langs functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows appear to lead to untrusted data leaks or insecure operations; no external network connections or sensitive data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Profiles are loaded from files or JSON strings, processed into LangProfile objects, which are then used to configure Detector instances. Input text is appended to detectors for detection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code handles file I/O and JSON parsing securely with exception handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical profile loading and language detection setup using file and JSON inputs with standard Python libraries. Profile loading includes checks for file existence and format, with exception handling. Profile addition avoids duplicates. The detector creation is straightforward. No external network activity or suspicious operations are present. The overall structure appears clean, with appropriate resource management and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate language detection implementation with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It safely loads profiles, manages detectors, and performs detection without exposing sensitive data or performing malicious actions.",
