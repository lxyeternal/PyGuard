{
  "purpose": "This code implements a language detection library that loads language profiles, manages profiles, and detects languages in given text inputs.",
  "sources": "Reads profile files from a directory, loads JSON profiles from input data, reads text input for detection.",
  "sinks": "Uses text input for language detection, potentially in 'detect' and 'detect_langs' functions; no data leakage or untrusted data processing outside detection context.",
  "flows": "Text input flows from 'detect' and 'detect_langs' functions into detector.append(), which then processes the data to detect language probabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Profile loading is standard; no unusual behavior or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages profile loading and language detection. It loads profiles from a directory or JSON input, constructs detectors, and performs detection. The profile loading process involves file reading and JSON parsing, with exception handling. The detection functions initialize a factory, create a detector, append text, and return results. No malicious data handling, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code present. The code does not contain any hidden backdoors or malicious logic; it follows typical patterns for a language detection library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a language detection library with profile management. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as intended for language detection purposes without evident security risks.",
