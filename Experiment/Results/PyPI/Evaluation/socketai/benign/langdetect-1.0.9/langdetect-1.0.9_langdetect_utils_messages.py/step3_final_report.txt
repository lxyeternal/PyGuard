  "purpose": "Load key-value message pairs from a local properties file for message retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'messages.properties' file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Retrieving messages via get_string() method; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "File read operation -> parsing lines -> storing in messages dictionary -> retrieval via get_string().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard file I/O and string decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a local properties file, parses each line into key-value pairs, decodes unicode escapes, and provides a singleton access point for message retrieval. It involves no network activity, external input beyond the file, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The design is typical for configuration or localization utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a standard message loading function, and shows no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is negligible (~0). The assessments across reports are consistent and accurate.",
