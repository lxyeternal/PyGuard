{
  "purpose": "The code loads message strings from a properties file and provides access to these messages via a singleton-like interface.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'messages.properties' file from the filesystem in the Messages constructor.",
  "sinks": "Returning message strings retrieved from the loaded messages dictionary.",
  "flows": "File reading in __init__() -> storing in self.messages -> get_string() retrieves message by key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The only file I/O is reading a local properties file, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that loads key-value message pairs from a properties file located relative to the script. It reads each line, splits by '=', and stores the decoded string in a dictionary. The get_string() method retrieves messages by key, with a default placeholder if missing. The global _messages variable ensures only one instance of Messages is created. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or suspicious logic present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard message loader with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads from a local file and provides a straightforward message retrieval interface. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
