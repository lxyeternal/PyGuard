  "purpose": "To load and retrieve messages from a properties file for localization or messaging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading from a file located relative to the script's directory: 'messages.properties'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; data is read from a local file, and only retrieved messages are returned.",
  "flows": "The code reads the properties file into memory during initialization and provides access via get_string(). No external data flow or user input is processed at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The file reading is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Messages that loads key-value pairs from a local properties file during initialization. It uses standard file I/O operations to read and parse the file contents, storing the data in a dictionary. The get_string() method returns the corresponding value for a given key, or a placeholder if not found. A singleton pattern is used via the global _messages variable to cache the Messages instance. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or network activity. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of message localization or configuration loading, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for loading message strings from a properties file. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet. It functions as intended for configuration or localization purposes without any evident security concerns.",
