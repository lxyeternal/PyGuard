  "purpose": "Load and retrieve message strings from a properties file for localization or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local file 'messages.properties' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "The code only reads data from a local file; no sinks involving untrusted input or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Messages object reads file content; get_string retrieves messages based on keys; no external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The use of encoding/decoding appears standard. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for loading message key-value pairs from a local properties file, with a singleton pattern for message retrieval. It uses standard file I/O without any external or untrusted data sources, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for configuration loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple message loader from a local file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for reading configuration messages without any suspicious activity.",
