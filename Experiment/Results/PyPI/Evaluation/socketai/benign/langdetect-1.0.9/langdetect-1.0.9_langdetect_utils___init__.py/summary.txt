  "conclusion": "The code's suspicious signals are primarily obfuscation and dynamic execution, which suggest moderate risk but lack definitive malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with Report 1 showing the highest concern. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, the assessment indicates moderate suspicion without confirmed malicious activity."
