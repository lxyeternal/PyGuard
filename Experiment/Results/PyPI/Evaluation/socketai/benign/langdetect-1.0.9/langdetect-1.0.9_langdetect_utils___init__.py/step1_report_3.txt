  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, possibly for general use or specific functionality, but the exact intent cannot be determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (if any are present). Specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points, but none are explicitly identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables or function arguments) to processing functions and potentially to output or storage locations. No explicit malicious flow (such as data exfiltration or code execution) is evident from the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. No backdoors, hidden functions, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with typical structure and function definitions. No suspicious code constructs, malicious imports, or obfuscated code patterns are identified. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. The code does not perform any network communication, file manipulation, or system commands indicative of malicious activity. Without further context or actual functional code, there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads identified. The overall security risk is low.",
