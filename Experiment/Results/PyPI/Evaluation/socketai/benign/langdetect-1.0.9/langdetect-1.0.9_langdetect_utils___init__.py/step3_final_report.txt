  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic execution (eval/exec), network activity, hardcoded strings, obfuscated strings, and input handling.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, data output streams.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or string data flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code (e.g., base64 strings, misleading variable names), dynamic execution without validation, hardcoded URLs/IPs, suspicious string patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of malicious intent but are not definitive alone. The presence of network activity or hardcoded secrets would heighten suspicion. Benign code lacks these patterns. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations, with higher scores for obfuscation and malware in reports indicating suspicious patterns. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed, and benign reports show no anomalies. The overall suspicion is moderate, primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code usage, warranting cautious but not alarmist scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code's suspicious signals are primarily obfuscation and dynamic execution, which suggest moderate risk but lack definitive malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with Report 1 showing the highest concern. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent. Overall, the assessment indicates moderate suspicion without confirmed malicious activity.",
