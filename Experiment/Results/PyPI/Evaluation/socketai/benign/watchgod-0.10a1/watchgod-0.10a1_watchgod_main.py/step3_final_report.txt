{
  "purpose": "Filesystem monitoring and process management, with change data passed via environment variables for subprocess control.",
  "sources": "Filesystem changes detected by RustNotify, environment variables ('WATCHGOD_CHANGES'), signals for process control.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'WATCHGOD_CHANGES' where serialized change data is stored, process signals (SIGINT, SIGKILL) for termination.",
  "flows": "Filesystem changes -> serialized into environment variable -> subprocess restart triggered by environment variable data and signals.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to pass serialized change data; potential exploitation if environment variables are manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a filesystem watcher that serializes detected changes into an environment variable and manages subprocesses accordingly. No malicious code, backdoors, or external communication is present. The environment variable pattern, while standard in some development tools, could be exploited if environment variables are compromised, especially in untrusted environments. Signal handling and process restart logic are typical and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate filesystem watcher and process supervisor with minimal security concerns primarily related to environment variable handling. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is detected.",
