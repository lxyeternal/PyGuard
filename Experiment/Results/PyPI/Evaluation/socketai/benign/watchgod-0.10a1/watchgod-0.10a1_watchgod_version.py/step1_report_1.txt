  "flows": "N/A, simple variable assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version variable and exports it via __all__. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The __all__ declaration indicates the intention to control module exports. The VERSION string appears to be a typical pre-release identifier. No indications of malicious activity, external data handling, or security issues are found.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, harmless version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
