  "purpose": "Define the package version as '0.10a1'.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '0.10a1' to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data usage observed.",
  "flows": "Assignment flows from the string literal to the VERSION variable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of defining a version string and exporting it via __all__. It is a standard practice in Python package modules. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks. The version string is a typical package version identifier, possibly indicating an alpha release.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves only to specify the package version, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
