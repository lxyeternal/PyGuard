  "purpose": "Define the package version as '0.10a1' and specify export variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '0.10a1' to VERSION; __all__ declaration for exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignment with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to VERSION and declares __all__ to include VERSION. There are no dynamic behaviors, inputs, outputs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is typical for version declaration in Python packages. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent and justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
