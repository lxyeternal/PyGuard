  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, straightforward variable assignment, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a tuple containing the string 'VERSION' and assigns a version string to the variable VERSION. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows. The version string indicates an alpha release, which is typical for development stages but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
