{
  "purpose": "This code imports a command-line interface (CLI) function from a local module and executes it if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current module to import 'cli'. The 'if __name__ == '__main__':' block detects if the script is run directly.",
  "sinks": "The 'cli()' function is invoked, which could execute further commands or code defined within that function.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'cli' and calls it when executed directly, passing control to whatever behavior is defined within 'cli()'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard for a CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical entry point for a Python CLI tool, importing a function and executing it conditionally. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious patterns evident. The simplicity suggests it is standard boilerplate for a CLI application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward and benign CLI entry point, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
