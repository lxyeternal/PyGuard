  "purpose": "Minimal Python CLI entry point importing and executing 'cli()' from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli and execution of cli() in main guard.",

  "flows": "Import .cli -> call cli() in main guard.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard pattern with no suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python CLI entry point that imports 'cli' from a local module and executes it if run directly. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'cli()', which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the benign appearance of this snippet. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward nature of the code. No logical flaws or inconsistencies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the implementation of 'cli()'. The scores assigned are consistent and appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a very low risk score of 0.1.",
