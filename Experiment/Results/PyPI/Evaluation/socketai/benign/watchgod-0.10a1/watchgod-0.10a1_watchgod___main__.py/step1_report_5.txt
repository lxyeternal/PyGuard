{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to run a command-line interface (CLI) function imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the execution condition check (__name__ == '__main__') to invoke the CLI function.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of the cli() function, which may process user input or command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "The code flow is: import cli -> check if script is main -> call cli().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward, with no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI function from a local module and executes it if the script is run as the main program. There are no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no external network or system calls present in this snippet. It appears to be a standard entry point for a CLI application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical entry point for a CLI-based Python application with no malicious behavior detected. It is simple and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
