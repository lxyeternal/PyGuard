  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for executing a command-line interface (CLI) defined in the 'cli' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli import cli",
  "sinks": "Calling cli() function in the main block",
  "flows": "import -> main check -> cli() function execution",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports, no unusual code patterns; the code is minimal and standard for CLI entry points",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function or object from a relative module, then executes it if the script is run as the main module. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or data leaks. The code structure is straightforward and typical for CLI entry scripts. Without inspecting the 'cli' implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard entry point script for executing a CLI. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues based solely on this code snippet.",
