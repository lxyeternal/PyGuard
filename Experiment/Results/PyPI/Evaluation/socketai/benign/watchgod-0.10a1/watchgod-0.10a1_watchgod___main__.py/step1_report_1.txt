{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point that executes a command-line interface (CLI) function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'cli' function from the local 'cli' module and invokes it if the script is run as the main program.",
  "sinks": "The 'cli' function call is a sink where potentially untrusted input could be processed if 'cli' handles untrusted data or executes commands based on user input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'cli' to executing 'cli()' when the script is run directly, which may process user inputs or arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no apparent anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. It does not show the implementation of 'cli', which could contain malicious behavior, but from this snippet alone, nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "This code acts as an entry point that imports a CLI function and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs. Since the core logic resides in the imported 'cli' function, any potential malicious activity depends on its implementation, which is not visible here. The code itself appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, the code appears to be a standard entry point for a command-line tool with no evidence of malicious behavior. Its security and safety depend on the implementation of the 'cli' function, which is not provided.",
