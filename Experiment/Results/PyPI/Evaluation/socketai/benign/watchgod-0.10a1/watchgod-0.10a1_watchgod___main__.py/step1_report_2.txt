{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for executing a command-line interface (CLI) function imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __name__ variable and imports the cli function from the local cli module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls the cli() function, which may execute commands or operations defined within that function.",
  "flows": "The script checks if it is the main module (__name__ == '__main__') and then invokes the cli() function; data flow depends on the implementation of cli().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a cli function from a local module and executes it if the script is run as the main program. There are no hardcoded secrets, no input validation, or suspicious behaviors visible in this snippet. The overall structure is typical for Python CLI applications. Since the content of the cli() function is not provided, its behavior cannot be evaluated; however, the snippet itself does not contain malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple entry point to execute a CLI command, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet. Its safety depends on the implementation of the imported cli() function, which is not available here.",
