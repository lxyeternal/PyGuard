{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for monitoring specified directories for file changes and executing a designated Python function upon such changes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include sys.argv for command-line arguments, environment variables (implicitly via sys.stdin), and file paths provided as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic function import and execution via import_string() and run_function(), and writing logs via logger. sys.stdin is temporarily reassigned in set_tty().",
  "flows": "The code flows from parsing command-line arguments, resolving paths, importing and executing user-specified functions, and monitoring file changes to trigger re-execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected. Usage of import_module and dynamic execution is standard for CLI tools, not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed. Tty handling is straightforward; no hidden network activity or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The script securely imports user-specified functions and executes them based on file system changes, with standard exception handling. Import and path resolution functions are typical, and the use of context managers for TTY handling is safe. Logging setup and sys.argv manipulation are standard for CLI tools. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. The only dynamic behaviors involve importing and executing code specified at runtime, which is controlled by the user. No network activity, data exfiltration, or covert channels are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for watching directories and executing functions on change. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured, with appropriate error handling, and does not exhibit obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
