  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'watchgod' Python package, configuring package metadata, optional Rust extension, and version loading.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'watchgod/version.py' via SourceFileLoader; environment variable 'SKIP_RUST_EXTENSION'; package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Source: 'watchgod/version.py' loaded via SourceFileLoader; Environment variable check controls optional Rust extension inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic loading for version info; no suspicious code or obfuscation; environment variable check is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py with standard practices. Dynamic loading of 'version.py' is common to avoid executing code prematurely but could be exploited if the file is malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The environment variable handling is safe. The overall structure and content are straightforward and align with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup script with no malicious intent. The main potential risk lies in the integrity of 'watchgod/version.py', which if compromised, could execute malicious code. Otherwise, the script is benign.",
