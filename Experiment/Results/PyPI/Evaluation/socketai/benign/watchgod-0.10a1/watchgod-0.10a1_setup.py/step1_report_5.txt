{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the watchgod package, responsible for package configuration, version loading, and optional Rust extension inclusion.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, loading version from 'watchgod/version.py', checking environment variable 'SKIP_RUST_EXTENSION'.",
  "sinks": "None identified—no untrusted data is written or transmitted; environment variables are checked but not used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SKIP_RUST_EXTENSION' influences whether Rust extensions are added; version info is loaded dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation detected. Usage of dynamic module loading via SourceFileLoader is standard for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading files, conditionally importing Rust extensions, and configuring package metadata. The dynamic import of version info is common in setup scripts. Environment variable controls optional feature inclusion. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, and no external network interactions occur.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a conventional setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles optional extensions and reads files securely. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
