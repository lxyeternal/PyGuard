{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the package configuration for 'watchgod', including reading metadata, handling dependencies, and configuring build options.",
  "sources": "Reads text from README.md, loads version info from 'watchgod/version.py', reads environment variables, and imports setup-related modules.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that handle untrusted input leading to security consequences are present. External module imports are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check ('SKIP_RUST_EXTENSION') influences whether 'setuptools_rust' is imported and used.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed. Usage of importlib to load version is standard. Conditional import based on environment variable is typical for optional extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup tasks: reading a description file, dynamically loading version info, optionally including a Rust extension based on environment variables, and configuring package metadata. All steps follow standard package setup practices with no signs of malicious intent. No suspicious data flows or anomalous code structures are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It uses common patterns for optional extension inclusion and safe file handling. No security risks or malware are apparent.",
