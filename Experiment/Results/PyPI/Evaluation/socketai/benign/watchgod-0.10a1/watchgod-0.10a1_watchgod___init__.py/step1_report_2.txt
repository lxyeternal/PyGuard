{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, used to import and expose certain modules, classes, functions, and version information for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.filters, .main, .version). No external data input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output, network calls, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and assigns __version__ and __all__, with no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The structure and content are typical for a package initialization file.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes, functions, and version info from local modules and sets the __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It merely exports selected components for use by other modules or users.",
