  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific functions, classes, and variables from other parts of the package and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules: .filters, .main, and .version, specifically importing classes, functions, and a version variable.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or sensitive operations within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The imported data flows into the module to define the public API, but no untrusted data flows or data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code solely manages imports and exports within a package, establishing an API surface. It imports classes and functions from sibling modules and a version constant. No input handling, external data processing, or suspicious operations are present. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package interface definition with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It simply manages module exports and imports without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
