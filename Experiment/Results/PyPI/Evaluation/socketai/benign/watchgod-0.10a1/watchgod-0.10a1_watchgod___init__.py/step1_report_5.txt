{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an initialization or entry point module that imports specific components from submodules and defines what is exported when the module is imported elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .filters, .main, and .version; also references to VERSION constant.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code structure is typical for package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports specific classes and functions from local modules and defines the package's __all__ for explicit exports. The VERSION constant is imported from a version module and assigned to __version__. No user input handling, no network calls, and no code execution beyond module imports are present. This is standard packaging boilerplate code, indicating no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages imports and exports for a Python package, with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
