{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's initialization module, importing various components and setting up module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.filters, .main, .version) and assignment of VERSION to __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; mainly import statements and module attribute assignments",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, assigns a version number, and defines the module's public interface. It contains no user input handling, external network operations, or code execution mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation, and the structure aligns with typical package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes module components.",
