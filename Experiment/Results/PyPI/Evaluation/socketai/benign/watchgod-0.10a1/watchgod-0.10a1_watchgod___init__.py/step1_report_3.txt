  "purpose": "The code is a module that imports specific functions and classes from local submodules and defines module-level variables and exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from .filters, .main, and .version modules; uses VERSION constant from .version.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity; no input/output operations or data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an initialization script for a package, importing components and defining exported symbols. It does not process user input, handle external data, or execute any dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply imports and exposes package components, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
