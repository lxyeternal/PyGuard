  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing classes, functions, and version info, and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.filters, .main, .version), reading version constant",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external network operations",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ and __version__ assignments; no dynamic or runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation, no secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing specific components and exposing them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
