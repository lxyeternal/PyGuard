  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Keystone identity resources and command-line argument parsing within OSC plugins.",
  "sources": "External libraries (`keystoneclient`, `osc_lib`) and input parameters for resource lookup functions.",
  "sinks": "Resource objects returned; no data leaks or malicious data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name or ID, domain info) used in resource lookup functions; no untrusted data processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard resource lookup and argument parsing functions with proper exception handling. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or handle untrusted data in a risky manner. The structure is clear, comments are appropriate, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility module for Keystone resource management in OSC plugins. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
