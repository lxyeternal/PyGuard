  "purpose": "Setup for internationalization (i18n) using oslo_i18n, defining translation functions and retrieving available languages.",
  "sources": "The call to oslo_i18n.get_available_languages(DOMAIN) within get_available_languages() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only reads language data from oslo_i18n library.",
  "flows": "Function get_available_languages() calls oslo_i18n.get_available_languages(DOMAIN) to retrieve language list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library, sets up translation functions, and exposes a method to list available languages. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate data insecurely. The only external call is to a standard library function that returns language options, which is benign. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard internationalization setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and does not pose any threat.",
