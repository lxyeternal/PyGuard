{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform benign operations such as reading environment variables, processing data, or interacting with files and networks without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, configuration files, system commands, network sockets",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system command executions, environment variable access",
  "flows": "Input sources like environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, potentially leading to network or file operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected; code structure appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and processes data without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are present. The absence of code or suspicious behavior justifies low malware and obfuscation scores. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily due to external interactions that are typical in benign scripts. Confidence is high given the thoroughness of the analysis and lack of indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is conservative but acceptable, and malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on the provided analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
