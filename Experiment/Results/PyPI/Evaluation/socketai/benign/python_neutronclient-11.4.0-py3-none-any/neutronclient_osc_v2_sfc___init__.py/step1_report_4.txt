  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or computation, possibly involving external inputs or configurations, although the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external files (exact sources are not visible in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of commands, especially if untrusted input is used without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as inputs or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are visible. The code uses standard Python features and libraries. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are present.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review indicates that the code processes data in a straightforward manner without employing obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors is detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. The code’s structure does not show signs of malicious intent or malicious flow patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, functional piece of Python code with no suspicious activities identified. However, without full context or the complete code, some assumptions remain, and a cautious low-confidence stance is maintained.",
