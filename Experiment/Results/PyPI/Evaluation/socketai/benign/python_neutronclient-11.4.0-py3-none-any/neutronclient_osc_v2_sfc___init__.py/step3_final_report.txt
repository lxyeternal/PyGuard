{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility or initialization script with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Import statements and variable initializations, likely reading configuration or environment data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs or external interactions, but none explicitly present or suspicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (imports, variables) to outputs or further processing, with no evidence of malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow detected; code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving imports and variable setup, with no functions like eval or exec, no network calls, and no suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No anomalies or red flags are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, and all reports' assessments are accurate. Overall, the supply chain security risk for this dependency is minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
