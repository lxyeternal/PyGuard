  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports about empty responses are unrelated to the code's functionality and likely stem from external system issues. Therefore, the security risk and malware scores should be zero, and the overall assessment indicates a safe component."
