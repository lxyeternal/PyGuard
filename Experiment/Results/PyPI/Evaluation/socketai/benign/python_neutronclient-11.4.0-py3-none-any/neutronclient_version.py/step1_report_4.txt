  "purpose": "Retrieve version information for the 'python-neutronclient' package using pbr.version",
  "sources": "Importing pbr.version and calling VersionInfo to get version string",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import pbr.version -> Instantiate VersionInfo -> Retrieve version_string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version retrieval with standard library usage",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pbr.version' module, creates a VersionInfo object for 'python-neutronclient', and assigns its version string to __version__. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard version retrieval logic used in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version retrieval snippet for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
