{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python module intended for data processing tasks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input streams.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs such as return statements, print functions, or file/network operations (none identified).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs; no suspicious or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign data processing module with standard constructs. No network, file, or system modifications are present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious functions are detected. The confidence in benignity is high (0.95). The absence of malicious indicators justifies a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects a conservative baseline, acknowledging limited context but no evident threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no obfuscation or malware detected.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
