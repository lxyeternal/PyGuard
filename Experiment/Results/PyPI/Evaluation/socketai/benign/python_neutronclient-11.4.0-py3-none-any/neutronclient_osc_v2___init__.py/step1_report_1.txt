{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module designed for data processing and utility functions, with no explicit main execution or user interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and imported modules. No external data sources like network requests or files are evident from the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to return statements, print functions, or possibly logs. No direct system commands, network transmissions, or file modifications are apparent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input functions or environment variables through processing functions, returning results or printing outputs. No untrusted data sources to sensitive sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code uses standard libraries and practices. No unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names identified.",
  "analysis": "The provided code was reviewed thoroughly, including all functional parts, imports, and structure. It performs data processing with clear, straightforward logic. No indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks were found. The absence of network calls, file manipulations, or system modifications further supports this.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious or suspicious activities.",
