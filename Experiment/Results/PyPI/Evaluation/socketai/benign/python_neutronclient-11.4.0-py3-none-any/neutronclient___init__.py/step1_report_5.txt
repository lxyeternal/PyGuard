  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or manipulation, but without additional context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or executes system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks possibly through variables or function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports were detected.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure is straightforward, involving standard Python constructs. No malicious code patterns like system calls, network connections, or data exfiltration routines are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious without context. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are present. The code does not contain evident malicious behaviors such as data theft or remote control mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It appears to be benign with no malicious intent detected.",
