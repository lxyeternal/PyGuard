{
  "purpose": "This module imports various classes and functions related to Microsoft Teams SDK models from a local submodule and exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the imported '_models_py3' module, which presumably defines the classes and functions being imported.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code; it does not handle untrusted data, user inputs, or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the '_models_py3' module into the namespace of this module through imports, then is exposed via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and follows standard Python import/export conventions. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes and functions from a local module '_models_py3' and then exposes all of them via the __all__ list for module consumers. This pattern is typical for SDK or API model modules. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears to be a simple interface layer. The absence of any processing logic, input/output handling, or external interactions reduces suspicion. The code is well-structured, and the import/export pattern suggests standard SDK design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK model interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports classes/functions for external use without processing or handling untrusted data. No malware or security issues are detected.",
