{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import module, exposing various classes from a submodule for external use, primarily related to Microsoft Teams and Office 365 integration features.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the local module './_models_py3' through import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or external network interactions within this code; it merely imports classes and lists them in __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports and exports class names without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious variable names, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures. It consists solely of import statements and a list of exported symbols.",
  "analysis": "The script imports numerous classes from a local module and re-exports them via __all__, indicating it's designed as a public API. There are no function definitions, data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive operations present. The code appears standard for a package's init or __init__.py file, aimed at organizing module exports. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or other malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export file with no malicious intent or security risks. It only imports classes and re-exports them, serving as a public API interface. There are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malware indicators.",
