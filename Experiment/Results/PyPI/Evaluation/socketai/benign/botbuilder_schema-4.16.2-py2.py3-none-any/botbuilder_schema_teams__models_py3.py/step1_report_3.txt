{
  "purpose": "Defines data models and schemas for Microsoft Teams and Bot Framework interactions, including tabs, messages, and meetings.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and attribute mappings, no external input sources or data reading functions observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions, network or file operations, or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow paths present; primarily data model definitions with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual behavior detected. All methods are simple initializers with no data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of class definitions, data models, and initializers for various Microsoft Teams-related objects. It lacks logic for data processing, input/output, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code injection. The structure and content align with standard SDK data schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious set of data model classes for Teams and Bot Framework integrations. No indicators of malware, malicious activity, or security risks are present.",
