{
  "purpose": "Defines static string constants for Microsoft Teams connector card content types and action types, serving as configuration or constants module.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes with string constants; no input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; static constants only.",
  "flows": "No data flows; constants are used as static references within larger codebases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions with string constants related to Microsoft Teams connector cards. No functions, dynamic code, data input/output, or network interactions are present. The code is simple, static, and serves as a configuration module. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. All signals indicate benign static constants with no security risks or malware potential. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
