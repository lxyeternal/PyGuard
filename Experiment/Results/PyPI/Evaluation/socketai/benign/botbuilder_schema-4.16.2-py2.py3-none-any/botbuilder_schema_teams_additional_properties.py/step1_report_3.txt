  "purpose": "Define constants for various content types and action types related to Microsoft Teams cards",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only declares static class variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code only sets constant string values",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious logic; straightforward static definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with static string constants representing content types and action types for Microsoft Teams cards. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no external interactions. The structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It appears to serve as a constants module or configuration setup without any embedded or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static constants definition for application use. No malicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks are evident.",
