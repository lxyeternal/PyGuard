{
  "purpose": "Defines string constants related to sign-in operations as an Enum class for authentication workflows.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static string definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; purely constant definitions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing beyond enum declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum with constants for sign-in verification and token exchange operation names, and an event name for token responses. It appears to be a straightforward, well-documented definition of constants related to authentication workflows, with no input handling, no dynamic code, and no suspicious activity. The code is simple, static, and adheres to standard practices for defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a configuration or constants module, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
