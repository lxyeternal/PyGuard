  "purpose": "Define constants for sign-in operations and event names related to authentication flow.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, especially no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines constants and an enumeration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, then defines a string-based Enum 'SignInConstants' with three constant string values related to sign-in processes. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. The structure appears clean and well-documented, with comments clarifying each constant's purpose. No signs of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines a set of constants used for sign-in processes. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. Overall, it appears safe and intended for standard use within an authentication context.",
