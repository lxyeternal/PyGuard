{
  "purpose": "Define constant strings related to sign-in operations for authentication workflows, likely used in authentication or bot services.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward enumeration of string constants with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum, defines a subclass of str and Enum with three string constants related to sign-in and token exchange operations, and includes descriptive comments. There are no input sources, no sinks, and no data flows or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign constants definition for use elsewhere in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enumeration of constants for sign-in related operation names. No malicious behavior, no anomalies, and no security issues detected.",
