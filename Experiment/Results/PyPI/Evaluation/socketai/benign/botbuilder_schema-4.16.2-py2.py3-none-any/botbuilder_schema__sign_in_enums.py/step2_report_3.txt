  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward definition of constants using an Enum class, with no dynamic behavior, input/output handling, or external interactions.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and well-documented, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is simple, static, and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The conclusions about safety and benign nature are justified based on the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose a security risk.\n   - No malware or malicious behavior is detected.\n   - Therefore, the risk scores should remain at 0, as the code is purely definitional.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present, malware score should stay at 0.\n   - The code is a benign constants declaration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's static nature and benign purpose.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign constants definition for sign-in operations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis and the code's simplicity.",
