  "purpose": "Defines constants related to sign-in operations and events for authentication workflows.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments within the SignInConstants Enum.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only contains static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and contains only enum definitions with static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a string enumeration for sign-in operation names and event identifiers. It contains no dynamic code, user input, or data handling. The constants are clearly named and documented, serving as configuration identifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured enumeration defining constants for sign-in operations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be part of an SDK or authentication framework setup.",
