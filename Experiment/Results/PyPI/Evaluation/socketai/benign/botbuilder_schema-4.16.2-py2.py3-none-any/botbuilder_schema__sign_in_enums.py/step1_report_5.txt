  "purpose": "Define string constants for sign-in related operations in an enumeration.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class for sign-in constants, providing named string values for various authentication operations and event names. There are no inputs, outputs, or data manipulation that could lead to security issues or malicious behavior. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured definition of constants for sign-in processes, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
