{
  "purpose": "Defines string constants for sign-in operations and event identifiers used in authentication workflows.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; static constant definitions within the class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as identifiers in other parts of the system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class inheriting from str, containing three string constants related to sign-in verification, token exchange, and token response events. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code serves as a static configuration component, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants definition for sign-in operations, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are justified and appropriate, reflecting a safe and standard implementation.",
