  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple enumeration of static string constants representing caller IDs.\n- No external input, data processing, or network activity is involved.\n- The code contains descriptive comments and uses standard Python enum features.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign static constants.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n- Since the code is purely static and serves as a reference, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n- No changes necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:** The reports correctly identify the code as a simple, safe enumeration with no security issues.",
