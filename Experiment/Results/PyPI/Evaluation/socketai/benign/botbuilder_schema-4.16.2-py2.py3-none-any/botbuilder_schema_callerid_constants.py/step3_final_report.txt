{
  "purpose": "Defines static string constants representing caller IDs for bot framework channels.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static constants are hardcoded in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants are used as identifiers without dynamic data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple enumeration of string constants used as caller ID identifiers in bot communication. It contains no input handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The comments clarify purpose, and the structure is standard. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The confidence in these assessments is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration serving as a reference for caller IDs. There are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
