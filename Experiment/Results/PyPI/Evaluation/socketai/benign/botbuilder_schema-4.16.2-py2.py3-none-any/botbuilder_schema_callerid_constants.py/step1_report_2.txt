  "purpose": "Define enumeration constants for various caller ID strings used in bot framework communications.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static string constants defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static constants are defined without input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward enumeration definition with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module, then defines a subclass CallerIdConstants that inherits from str and Enum. It declares three string constants with descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose in bot framework communication. There are no inputs, no processing, and no suspicious or malicious activity evident. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constant reference within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-documented enumeration of constants related to caller IDs in bot framework contexts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility code segment.",
