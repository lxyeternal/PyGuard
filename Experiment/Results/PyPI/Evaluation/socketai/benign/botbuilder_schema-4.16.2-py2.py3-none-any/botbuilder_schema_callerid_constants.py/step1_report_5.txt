  "purpose": "Define enumeration constants for caller IDs related to the Bot Framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no suspicious code or obfuscated sections; straightforward enum definitions and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of string constants for caller IDs using Python's Enum class. The constants represent URNs used in the Bot Framework, with accompanying docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no input sources, data processing, external data reads, or any code that could lead to malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clear, simple, and follows standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of constants for caller IDs in the Bot Framework, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It serves a purely informational purpose.",
