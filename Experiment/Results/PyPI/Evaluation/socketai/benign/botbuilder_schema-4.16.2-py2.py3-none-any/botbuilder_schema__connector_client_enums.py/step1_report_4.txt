{
  "purpose": "Define various string enums related to activity types, roles, and actions used in a Microsoft chatbot or communication framework.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; all enums are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all code consists of static enum class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines several Enum classes inheriting from str, representing fixed string values for different categories within a communication or bot framework. It does not process any external data, execute dynamic code, or include potentially malicious constructs. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors to analyze beyond static class definitions. This code appears to be a standard, safe configuration of enums for use in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration module with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It serves as a straightforward set of constant definitions for a bot framework.",
