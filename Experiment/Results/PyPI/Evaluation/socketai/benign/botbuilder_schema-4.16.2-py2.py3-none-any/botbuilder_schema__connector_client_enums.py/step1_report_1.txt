  "purpose": "Define various enumeration classes for use in a Microsoft-related messaging or bot framework.",
  "sources": "Constant string values assigned to enum members, imported modules (enum).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources or leads to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines enums with static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code is straightforward enumeration definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of enum class definitions for string-based constants, with no user input handling, data processing, or external calls. It imports only the standard 'enum' module and defines enums for various activity and message types. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns, and no potential backdoors or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of enumeration definitions used for structured messaging in a bot or communication framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and purposefully designed for clarity and consistency.",
