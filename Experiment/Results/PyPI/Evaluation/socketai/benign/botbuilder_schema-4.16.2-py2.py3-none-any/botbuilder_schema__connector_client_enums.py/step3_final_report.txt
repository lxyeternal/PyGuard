  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations for roles, activity types, message formats, actions, and other constants used in a messaging or bot framework.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions; no external input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static constants used as references within other code modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes with string constants, used for categorization and configuration within a messaging framework. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or executable logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, serving as a reference for other components. Given this, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and justified. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static collection of enumeration definitions with no security or malicious concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
