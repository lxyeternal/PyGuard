  "purpose": "Define constants related to speech processing, specifically an empty speak tag for speech synthesis control.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading points are present.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of a class with a string constant; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a single string constant representing an XML speak tag. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The comment explains its usage in speech synthesis contexts. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are identified. The structure is straightforward and serves as a configuration or constants holder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely defining a constant for speech synthesis purposes. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior risks.",
