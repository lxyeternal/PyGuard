  "purpose": "Defines a constant XML string used in speech synthesis processing.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class constant.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; constant is used as a static configuration value.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment used in speech synthesis context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class with a single string constant representing an XML 'speak' tag. It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external dependencies. The constant is used for speech synthesis control. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code is benign, with no obfuscation, secrets, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static constant holder for speech synthesis configuration. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is not obfuscated. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
