{
  "purpose": "Define constants used in speech interaction processing, specifically an XML tag indicating an empty speech output.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only static class variable definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code is purely defining a constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a class with a single constant string attribute used as a placeholder or indicator for no speech output. It contains no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no sensitive data handling. The class and attribute are straightforward and well-documented, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of a constant string for speech processing purposes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
