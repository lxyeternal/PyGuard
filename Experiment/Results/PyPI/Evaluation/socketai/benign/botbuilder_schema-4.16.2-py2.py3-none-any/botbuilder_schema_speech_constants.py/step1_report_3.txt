{
  "purpose": "Defines constants used in speech interaction processing, specifically for speech synthesis tags.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only declares a constant string variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code is a simple class declaration with a string constant.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static constants are used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard documentation and constant definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a single string constant representing an XML speak tag. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The purpose is to serve as a static resource for speech synthesis features. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present, and the code aligns with typical SDK or API design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard constant declaration with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
