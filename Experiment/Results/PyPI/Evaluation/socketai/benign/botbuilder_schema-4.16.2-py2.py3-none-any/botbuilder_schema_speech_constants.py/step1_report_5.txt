{
  "purpose": "Define constants for speech interaction processing, specifically a speak tag used to indicate no speech should be generated.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code only defines a static constant.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a static class with a constant value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple class defining a single constant string for speech processing. It contains only a docstring and a static string constant with no external input, output, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented constant definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is purely for setting a speech-related XML tag.",
