{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with constants for speech interaction processing, specifically an XML tag for empty speech output.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is output to external systems or untrusted environments.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data; the class only contains static constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The class is a simple container for a static string constant representing an XML speak tag. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, or external interactions. It appears to be a standard, benign utility class for speech synthesis configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a constants holder for speech synthesis tags. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
