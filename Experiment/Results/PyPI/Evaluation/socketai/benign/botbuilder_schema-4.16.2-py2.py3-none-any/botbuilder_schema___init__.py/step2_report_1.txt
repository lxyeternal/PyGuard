  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code only imports classes/constants from internal modules and defines `__all__`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing, external input, or output; purely static imports.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; standard pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical module setup, with no signs of malicious behavior. It appears safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on imports and `__all__`.\n- No data flows or suspicious patterns.\n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: benign, standard module initialization.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: imports from internal modules, no external data handling.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- Standard SDK package structure.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, straightforward imports and exports.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code.\n- No anomalies.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: import and re-export of SDK components.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports, as the code is purely structural, with no external input or processing.\n\n### Final justification:\n- The code is a standard module that imports classes and constants, setting up the public API via `__all__`.\n- No data flows, no dynamic code, no network or file operations.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No adjustments needed.",
