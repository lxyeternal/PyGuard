  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code imports classes and constants from internal modules and defines `__all__`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or execution; purely static imports and exports.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard module setup, likely part of an SDK or package initialization. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks are evident.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The scoring aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, importing modules and defining `__all__`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard package setup, no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, importing classes and constants, setting `__all__`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network operations.  \n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical module aggregation, benign in nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Importing model classes and constants for a bot SDK, defining exports.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or network activity.  \n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK module, safe and straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Importing SDK components and constants, defining `__all__`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical organizational module, benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import/export structure.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification\n\nThis code is a standard module setup, importing various classes and constants for use elsewhere, with no dynamic behavior, no external data processing, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.
