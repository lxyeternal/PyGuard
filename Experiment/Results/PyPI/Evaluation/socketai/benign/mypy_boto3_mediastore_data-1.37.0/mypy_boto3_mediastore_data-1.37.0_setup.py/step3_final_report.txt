  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-mediastore-data library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' appears to be a typo but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. It uses well-formed, static metadata and dependencies. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo. All security and malware scores are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature of the script. The code's simplicity and lack of external influence confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified. The only minor issue is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
