  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to package and distribute the mypy-boto3-mediastore-data Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Path reading for README.md, static strings for package metadata, import statements for setuptools and pathlib, and package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input handling, no network operations, no command execution, no file manipulation beyond reading a local file.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Packaging setup configuration -> No data flows from external untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is a standard setup script with typical metadata and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and defines package metadata. It reads a local README.md file to include as long description. The setup() function configures package details, classifiers, dependencies, and URLs. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or network activity occurs. The dependencies are static and conditional, based on Python version. Overall, the script functions as a typical package setup without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and configuration.",
