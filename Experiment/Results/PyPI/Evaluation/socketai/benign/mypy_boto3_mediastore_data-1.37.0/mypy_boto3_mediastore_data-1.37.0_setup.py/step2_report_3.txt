  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the scores assigned, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- No untrusted inputs, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is likely a typo but not malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk is 0, consistent with the above.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** No reason to assign a higher risk score; the code is benign.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025,\" which might be a typo but is not malicious.\n- The code reads a local README.md file and uses static package metadata, which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data handling, no external command execution, no network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
