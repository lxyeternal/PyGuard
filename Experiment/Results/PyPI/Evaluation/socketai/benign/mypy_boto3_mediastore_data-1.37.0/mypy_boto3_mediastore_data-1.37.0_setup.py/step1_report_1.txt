  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring the 'mypy-boto3-mediastore-data' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description; reads package data; imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and uses their content for package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears to be standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a markdown file for description, and calling setup() with static metadata and configuration options. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no network activity, and no code that modifies system state or performs malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code used for packaging Python modules.",
