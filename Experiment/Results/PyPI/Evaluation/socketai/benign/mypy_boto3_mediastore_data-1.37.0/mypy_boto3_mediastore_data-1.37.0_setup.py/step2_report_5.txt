  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code reads a local README.md file, imports from setuptools, and calls setup() with static metadata.\n- No untrusted inputs, network activity, or code injection is present.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright year 2025, which appears to be a typo but not malicious.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**\n   - The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or anomalies.\n   - No evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malware.\n   - No dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - The only potential \"issue\" is the future copyright year (2025). This could be a typo or oversight, but it does not pose a security risk.\n   - No other logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct; no malware is present.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Challenging assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code as benign.\n   - The only questionable point is the future copyright year, but that’s not a security concern.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the copyright year, which is likely a typo. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                      |\n| Security Risk     | 0                      |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
