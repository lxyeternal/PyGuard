{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library called 'mypy-boto3-mediastore-data'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description, imports setup from setuptools, and reads environment variables indirectly via package installation requirements.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No direct data leaks, network operations, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "The script loads package metadata and dependencies, flows are straightforward from source files to setup configuration variables, with no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The use of the 'Path' module is standard for reading files. The install_requires line uses a conditional dependency based on Python version, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for filesystem interaction and package setup. It reads a README file for the long description, then calls setup() with various metadata parameters. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic evaluation occurs. The dependencies are specified with environment markers, which is typical for cross-version compatibility. No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks detected. It appears to be a straightforward package configuration file.",
