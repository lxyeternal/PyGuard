  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and class for AWS MediaStore Data SDK wrapper.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The code is a standard SDK stub.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores seem appropriate. The low security risk reflects the absence of vulnerabilities. Malware score is correctly zero. Confidence is high given the straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on type annotations and interface.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies or malicious patterns. The code is a typical SDK wrapper.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are consistent. Slightly higher security risk (0.2) due to the mention of untrusted parameters, but that is inherent to SDK clients and not a code flaw.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for SDK, no untrusted data handling directly.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK stub, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nVery high confidence, appropriate scores. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, standard SDK interface.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious code. No obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are reasonable. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK wrapper with potential for URL generation and data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The mention of presigned URLs and data flows from untrusted sources is standard for AWS SDKs, but presigned URLs can be misused if not properly managed. Still, the code itself does not implement any malicious logic—it's a wrapper.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, but with a note that presigned URLs should be used carefully.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering presigned URL generation can be misused if misconfigured, but that is a feature, not a vulnerability in the code. Malware score remains zero, as there's no malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code being a straightforward SDK wrapper.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting potential misuse rather than inherent vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, as the code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured SDK stub for AWS MediaStore Data client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only potential security concern relates to presigned URL generation, which is a standard AWS feature. Proper management of these URLs is the responsibility of the user, not the code itself.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — mainly due to presigned URL features, but not inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and intended as a type-safe SDK wrapper. No malicious activity or backdoors are present. The scores across reports are appropriate, and I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues found in the code.  \n- Scores are justified and consistent.  \n- The only caution is proper management of presigned URLs, which is standard practice.",
