{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator class for the mediastore-data service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. Reads version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted input or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code defines classes and methods for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard type annotation and class definition for a boto3 paginator.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a paginator class for mediastore-data. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, but does not perform any network, file, or data manipulation. It strictly provides type annotations and class structure for boto3 paginator, with no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external calls that could be malicious. The presence of copyright and documentation links are benign and typical for open-source code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotation module for boto3 paginators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for type safety in a larger project.",
