  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward type annotation and class extension for boto3 mediastore-data paginators.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are correctly scored as 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it accurately describes the code as a standard, benign type annotation module.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Correctly scored 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** No concerns; score 0 is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical type annotation and class definition with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Correctly 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Appropriate as 0.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard paginator class extension with no malicious activity.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both correctly scored 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, describing the code as a benign stub for static analysis.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.**  \n- **The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent and reasonable.**  \n- **The code itself is purely for type annotations and class structure, with no dynamic or network behavior.**\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's benign nature.**",
