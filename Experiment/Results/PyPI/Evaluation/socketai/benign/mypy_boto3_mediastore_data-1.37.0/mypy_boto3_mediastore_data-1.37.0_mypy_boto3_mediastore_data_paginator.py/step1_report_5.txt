  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for mediastore-data service client, primarily for static type checking and code completion.",
  "sources": "import statements, class definitions, method signatures, type annotations, documentation links",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or data transmission code present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a type annotation and class structure module",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations, imports, and class definitions for paginator objects related to the mediastore-data service in boto3. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, and type checking logic. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code is present. The code appears to be a standard part of a type stub library intended for static analysis and IDE support. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard type annotation stub for boto3 mediastore-data paginators. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. It simply provides type hints and class structures for static type checking.",
