  "purpose": "Provides type annotations and a paginator class for the boto3 mediastore-data client to facilitate static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; conditional import for Unpack based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no runtime data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "Class ListItemsPaginator extends a generic Paginator; paginate method accepts parameters for pagination requests and returns a PageIterator of responses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard imports, class inheritance, and documentation references.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured SDK stub module for boto3 mediastore-data paginators, with no dynamic code, network activity, or malicious patterns. It uses conditional imports for compatibility and defines a class with a paginate method that aligns with boto3 documentation. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK stub module intended for static analysis support. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and accurate.",
