  "purpose": "Provides a static interface module for mediastore-data service, importing classes and setting up exports.",
  "sources": "Static imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static code with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static module with no dynamic execution, user input, or network activity. The only anomaly is the future year in the copyright, which appears to be a placeholder or oversight. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The high malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. The risk score should be very low, around 0.1, due to the minor anomaly. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the future date, which does not pose a security threat. The scores should reflect this low risk, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a risk score around 0.1.",
