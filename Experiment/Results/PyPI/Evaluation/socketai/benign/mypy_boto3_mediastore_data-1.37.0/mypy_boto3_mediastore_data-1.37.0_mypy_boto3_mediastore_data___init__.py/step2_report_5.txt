  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the findings and scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a simple module for interfacing with mediastore-data, mainly static imports and exports. No dynamic or untrusted data handling. The copyright date is future-dated (2025), which is unusual.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior. The high risk score (0.9) seems disproportionate given the benign nature. The only anomaly is the future date, which does not pose a security risk. Therefore, a risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 might be more appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is straightforward, with no data sinks or external calls. Future date (2025) noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Same as above. The code is benign, and the high risk score is unjustified. I recommend lowering it to around 0.1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—simple import/export module, no dynamic code, no external data, future date.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with previous reports. The risk score should be lowered to reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward interface module with no suspicious activity. Future date noted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 1 is too high given the benign code. It should be reduced to about 0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign interface code, with documentation and no data processing. Future date noted as a minor anomaly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The risk score is high but perhaps slightly overestimated; I would suggest around 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Risk Score:** The consistently high scores (0.9 or 1) are unjustified for such static, benign modules. The only notable anomaly is the future date, which does not pose a security risk but may suggest outdated or placeholder info. Therefore, I recommend lowering the risk scores to around **0.1 to 0.2** for all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2, reflecting the benign nature but noting the future date as a minor anomaly.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no malicious or obfuscated content. The high risk scores assigned are overestimations; they should be lowered to more accurately reflect the low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context—static interface code with no runtime behavior or external data handling should not be rated as high risk unless there are signs of malicious intent or obfuscation, which are absent here.",
