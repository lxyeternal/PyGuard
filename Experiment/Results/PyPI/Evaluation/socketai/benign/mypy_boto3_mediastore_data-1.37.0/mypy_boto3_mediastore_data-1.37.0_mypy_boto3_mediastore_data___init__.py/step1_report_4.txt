{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for mediastore-data service, exporting client and paginator classes for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules, and the module's docstring.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines exports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which may be a future date and is unusual, but not malicious. The code does not perform any data processing or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes from local modules and exposes them as part of its public API. The docstring provides usage examples and documentation links. There is no code execution, data handling, or external interaction that could be malicious. The copyright date is future-dated but does not pose security concerns. Overall, the code appears to be standard boilerplate for an SDK or library module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface module for the mediastore-data service with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It merely exports classes and contains documentation.",
