{
  "purpose": "Provide a main interface for the mediastore-data service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator); static string for documentation and copyright.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The copyright year appears to be future (2025) but that is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes from local modules and sets up a client alias. It includes documentation and usage examples as comments. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The content appears to be standard, well-structured package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward interface module with no malicious or security-related issues. It mainly defines imports and documentation, with no evident risks or anomalies.",
