{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the mediastore-data service, including documentation and imports for client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator); no external data sources or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially malicious actions; no network, file, or environment variable usage detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports, aliases, and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright date in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscated content.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes, sets an alias for the client, and defines exports. No runtime logic, input handling, or external data manipulation present. The presence of a future date (2025) is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, legitimate interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which may suggest outdated or placeholder information. Overall, the code is benign.",
