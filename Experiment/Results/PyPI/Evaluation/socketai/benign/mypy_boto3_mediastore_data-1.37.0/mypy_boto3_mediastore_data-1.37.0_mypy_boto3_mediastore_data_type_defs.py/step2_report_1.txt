  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the reasoning and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is purely static type definitions for the mediastore-data AWS SDK, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious content.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.\n- The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is standard practice.\n- The code relies on standard modules (`typing`, `sys`, `datetime`, `botocore.response`) and local literals, with no external or untrusted data sources.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any issues in the code. The code appears correct and safe.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident. The type annotations are appropriate, and the code is purely declarative.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risk.\n- They correctly note that the code is static type definitions, with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0. Since there's no malicious code, no vulnerabilities, and the code is purely for type annotations, this is justified.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n\n- Not applicable; all scores are 0, which is justified.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound and aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of static type definitions for an AWS SDK module. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nNo issues detected. The code is safe, standard, and purely declarative. The existing scores and reasoning are correct.",
