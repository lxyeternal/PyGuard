  "purpose": "Type annotations for mediastore-data service type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, botocore.response, and local literals; type definitions for data structures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static type annotations only.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static type definitions for AWS mediastore-data SDK, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate safe, standard code with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and contains no malicious or security-risk elements. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
