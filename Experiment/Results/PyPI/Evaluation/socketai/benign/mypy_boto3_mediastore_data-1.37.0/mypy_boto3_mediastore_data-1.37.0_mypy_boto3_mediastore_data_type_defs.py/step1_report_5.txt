{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for mediastore-data service interactions, intended to structure data used in API calls and responses.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines data types, classes, and constants without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input directly or pass data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no runtime data flows or processing logic involving untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard type annotations and import statements. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for a Python SDK interacting with mediastore-data. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. No external input handling, command execution, or data transmission code is present. The structure is straightforward and primarily consists of class definitions and type aliases. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, structured set of type definitions for a media store data SDK. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a standard, well-structured interface definition module.",
