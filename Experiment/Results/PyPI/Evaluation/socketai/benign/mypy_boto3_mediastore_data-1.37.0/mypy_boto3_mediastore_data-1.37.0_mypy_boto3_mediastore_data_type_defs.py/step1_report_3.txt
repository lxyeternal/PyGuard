  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for mediastore-data service, facilitating type checking and code clarity in a larger AWS SDK context.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only code-defined type annotations and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing; no potential data leak points or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely type definitions and imports, with no data flow or logic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and data class definitions. It imports from 'botocore.response' and 'typing' modules, defines various TypedDicts, and includes a union type for BlobTypeDef. No runtime logic, network operations, or data manipulation present. All components appear legitimate, intended solely for type hinting and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type definitions and annotations for the mediastore-data AWS service. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and solely used for type hinting, with no indications of malware or security threats.",
