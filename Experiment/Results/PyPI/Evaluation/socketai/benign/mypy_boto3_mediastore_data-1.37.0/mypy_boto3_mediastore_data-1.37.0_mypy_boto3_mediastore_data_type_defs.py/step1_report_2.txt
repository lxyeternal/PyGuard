  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for mediastore-data service interactions in Python.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, datetime, typing), third-party modules (botocore.response), internal module (.literals).",
  "sinks": "None present; code primarily defines types and data structures without executing untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flows are implemented; only type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; code is static type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules to define data types for mediastore-data service. It uses conditional imports based on Python version to ensure compatibility. The type definitions are typical for API request and response structures, with no dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious patterns. No external inputs are processed at runtime; the code is purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as type annotations for a boto3 mediastore-data client. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward, well-structured static type definition module with no suspicious behavior.",
