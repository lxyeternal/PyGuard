{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for mediastore-data service interactions, mainly used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, sys, datetime, typing, and botocore.response, as well as local literals.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines data types and constants.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or processing logic present, just type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code solely contains type definitions, no code execution or data handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes type annotations for various mediastore-data service requests and responses, importing necessary modules and handling Python version compatibility. It defines data structures as TypedDict and type aliases, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or code execution. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as type definitions for static analysis and documentation. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or potentially malicious constructs. It appears safe and standard for SDK type annotations.",
