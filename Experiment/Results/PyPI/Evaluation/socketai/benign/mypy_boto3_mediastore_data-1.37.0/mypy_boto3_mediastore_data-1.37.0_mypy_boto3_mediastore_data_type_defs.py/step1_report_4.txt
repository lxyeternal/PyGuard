  "purpose": "Type definitions for mediastore-data service API, providing structured data types for request and response handling.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input; type definitions are static annotations. The only input source could be external data used in the context where these types are applied.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or outputted by this code itself.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present within this static type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code strictly defines types and imports, with no executable or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations and class definitions for data structures used in a media storage service. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, but no runtime logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. External dependencies are standard and used appropriately. The code appears to be a well-structured type definition module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type definition module for a media storage SDK, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
