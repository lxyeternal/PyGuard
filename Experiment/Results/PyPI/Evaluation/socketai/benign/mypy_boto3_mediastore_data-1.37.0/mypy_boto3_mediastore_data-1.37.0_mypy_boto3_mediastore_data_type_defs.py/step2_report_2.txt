  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly describe the code as a set of static type definitions for mediastore-data service interactions.\n- They emphasize the absence of runtime logic, data processing, or untrusted data handling.\n- They confirm that the code uses standard practices, conditional imports for compatibility, and only defines data structures.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified in any report.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, confidence of 1, and a security risk score of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step evaluation:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n- The reports agree that the code contains only type annotations and data structure definitions, with no executable logic or data handling.  \n- No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n- They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative and safe.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue**  \n- Malware score: all 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- Security risk: all 0, consistent with the absence of runtime logic or external data handling.  \n- Obfuscated: all 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- These scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**  \n- No issues or suspicious activity justify higher scores.  \n- The code is purely static type definitions, which are inherently low risk.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations**  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or data manipulations.  \n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities**  \n- The reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities based on the code content.  \n- No assumptions about malicious intent are necessary or justified.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report**  \n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The high confidence (1) reflects the thoroughness and agreement among reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static set of type annotations and data structure definitions. It contains no executable code, no external data processing, and no suspicious patterns. The consistent expert analysis confirms that the code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the current scores are appropriate and justified**. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The code is a standard, well-structured type definition module for AWS mediastore-data SDK.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
