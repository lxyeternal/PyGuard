  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static package info or version details based on a command-line argument (`--version`).\n   - No dynamic data processing, network calls, or external dependencies are involved.\n   - The code is not obfuscated, nor does it contain any hidden or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or potentially malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, with high confidence (1.0). This is consistent with the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n   - The reports do not assume malicious intent without basis; they base their conclusion on the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n3. **Score Review and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the script as a simple informational CLI utility.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis provided.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware**: 0\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0\n  - **Risk**: 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a simple, static CLI utility for displaying package info and version details. No malicious or risky behaviors are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's straightforward purpose.",
