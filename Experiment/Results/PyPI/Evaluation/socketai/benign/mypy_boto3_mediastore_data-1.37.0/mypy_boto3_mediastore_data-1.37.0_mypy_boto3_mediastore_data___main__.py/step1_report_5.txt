  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 MediaStoreData stub library and package version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, writes package info and version info to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv, then either prints version info or package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, functioning as a CLI tool that outputs static information based on user input. It does not process or evaluate untrusted data beyond command-line argument checking, which is standard. No external network calls, no file operations, and no suspicious code patterns are present. All data output is static and informational. The script adheres to typical CLI patterns with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility that outputs package and version info based on command-line arguments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this code. It appears safe and benign.",
