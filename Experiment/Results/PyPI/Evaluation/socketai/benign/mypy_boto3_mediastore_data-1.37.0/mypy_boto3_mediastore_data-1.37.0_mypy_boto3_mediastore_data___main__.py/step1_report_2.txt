  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 MediaStoreData, including version info and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes package info and version details)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (output), sys.argv (input for version check)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument in sys.argv determines if print_version() is called; otherwise, print_info() executes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior; simple informational output functions",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info. It uses standard library sys module for input/output. No external network connections, data leakage, or malicious code is present. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are detected. The code appears to be an informational script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for providing package info and version details via command-line interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
