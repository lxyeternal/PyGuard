  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` for the `--version` flag.\n   - It writes output to `sys.stdout` using `write()`.\n   - No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input beyond argument checking.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - The code is straightforward, clean, and serves a benign purpose.\n\n2. **Issues in the Code:**\n   - **Presence of issues:** None. The code is simple and safe.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the script is a benign CLI utility.\n   - They note the absence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, external network activity, or data leaks.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n   - The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or intent.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks are present.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code's actual behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or lead to security issues.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe CLI utility.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Code is clear, straightforward, and readable                |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or external calls detected |\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is safe, with no security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the assessments provided.**",
