  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "Argument check ('--version') leads to print_version(), otherwise print_info() outputs static info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and lacks dynamic or external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs static output based on command-line input, with no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or untrusted data processing. It uses standard modules and outputs fixed strings. No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence.",
