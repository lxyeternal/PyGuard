{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write() outputs data; no untrusted input is used for data output, and no external data sources are invoked.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' flows from sys.argv to the conditional check, leading to printing the version; otherwise, it prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs straightforward output functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and primarily outputs static information based on a command-line argument. It does not process or handle untrusted input in a way that could lead to security issues. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility designed to display package information and version. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
