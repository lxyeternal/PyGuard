  "purpose": "CLI utility for displaying package information and version details for boto3 MediaStoreData stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, sys.argv for input commands",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, call print_version() and output version; otherwise, call print_info() and output package info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code is straightforward, primarily for informational output. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes main() which processes command-line arguments to decide which info to display. There are no data leaks, external connections, or suspicious behaviors. It solely outputs static information based on the command-line argument. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for informational purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
