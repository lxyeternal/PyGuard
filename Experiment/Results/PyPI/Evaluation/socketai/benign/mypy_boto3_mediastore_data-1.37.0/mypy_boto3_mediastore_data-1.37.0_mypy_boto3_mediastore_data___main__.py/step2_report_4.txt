  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` for the `--version` flag.\n   - It outputs to `stdout` via `sys.stdout.write()`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing involving untrusted input.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Issues in the Report's Logic, Reasoning, or Summary**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and safe.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - Malware: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Security Risk: 0, justified as the code does not pose security threats.\n   \n   No adjustments needed here; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is clearly safe; thus, the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted suspicions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, code is clear)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a minimal, safe CLI utility for displaying static package info.\n- No changes needed; the analysis and scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary**: The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores reflect the true nature of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: Maintain the current scores:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0",
