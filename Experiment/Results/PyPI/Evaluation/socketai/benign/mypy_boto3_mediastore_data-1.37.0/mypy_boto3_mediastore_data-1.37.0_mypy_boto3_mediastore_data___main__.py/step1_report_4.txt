{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point to display package information or version details for a Python package related to boto3 MediaStoreData.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no sinks that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it processes command-line input and prints static information. It uses standard Python modules (sys) for input/output. No untrusted data sources or potentially dangerous code execution paths are present. The functions only print static package info or version details. The control flow is simple, and the code is not obfuscated or suspicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package metadata and version information. It does not contain malicious code, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for a package entry point.",
