  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The report correctly identifies the code as benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a static version string assignment.  \n- **Anomaly:** The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming current date is before 2025). This could be a typo or placeholder, but not a security concern.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No malicious code, just an unusual future year.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign. No change.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, a simple static assignment with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a static string assignment.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — suitable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same straightforward version assignment.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No problems.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year in Report 2, which does not pose a security threat.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is purely declarative and standard.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk, just a version string.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No changes needed.",
