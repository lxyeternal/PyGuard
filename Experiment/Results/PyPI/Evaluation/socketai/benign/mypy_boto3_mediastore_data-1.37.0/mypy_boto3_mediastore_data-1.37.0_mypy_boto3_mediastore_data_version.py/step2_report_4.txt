  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential risks.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or data flows are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date, possibly a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n\n**Issue Presence:**\n- The code is straightforward; all reports correctly identify that it only assigns a string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The anomaly regarding the future copyright year is valid but does not impact security.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign nature.\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points & Recommendations:\n\n1. **Malware Score (0):**\n   - Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n   \n2. **Obfuscated Score (0):**\n   - Correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n   \n3. **Security Risk Score (0):**\n   - Correct; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Anomalies:**\n   - The only anomaly is the future year \"2025.\" While not a security issue, it might be worth noting as a possible typo or placeholder. It doesn't affect the security assessment.\n\n5. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports give a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a minimal, standard version declaration.**  \n**No issues, no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks are present.**  \n**The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.**\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and no changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The only note is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue but might be corrected for accuracy.",
