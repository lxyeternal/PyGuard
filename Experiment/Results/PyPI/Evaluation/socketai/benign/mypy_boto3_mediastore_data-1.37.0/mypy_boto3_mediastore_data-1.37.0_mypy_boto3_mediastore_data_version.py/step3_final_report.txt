  "flows": "None; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year 2025, which is unusual but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string, with a copyright notice. No dynamic code, inputs, or external data are involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The only minor anomaly is the future year 2025, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is minimal and standard. No obfuscation or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not pose a security risk. All reports are accurate, and no changes to scores are necessary.",
