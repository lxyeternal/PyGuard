  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways; simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025), which may be an inconsistency or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice for Python packages. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year being set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, potentially indicating an error or placeholder. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version identifier with no malicious intent. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not pose a security risk.",
