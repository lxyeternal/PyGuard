  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, as the analysis is accurate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear.  \n- **Security risk:** 0, no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid and accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also correctly notes the simple assignment.  \n- **Anomaly:** The future copyright year (2025) is noted as unusual but not security-related.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, the reasoning is sound.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.  \n- **Security risk:** 0, no issues.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly states the code is just a version string assignment with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is correct.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; simple static assignment with no external data or malicious patterns.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; standard version declaration.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is suitable.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, static version assignment with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which does not impact security.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard version declaration with no security issues. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
