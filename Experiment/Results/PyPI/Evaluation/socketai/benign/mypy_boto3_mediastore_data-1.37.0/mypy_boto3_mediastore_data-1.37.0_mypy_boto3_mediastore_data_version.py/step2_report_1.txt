  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, as well as the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code assigns a static string to `__version__`, with no data flow or suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, standard practice, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with the only noted anomaly being the future copyright year (2025).  \n- **Assessment:** The future year could be a typo or placeholder but does not pose a security risk. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Basic assignment with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is minimal and standard.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, simple static assignment.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Standard version declaration with no anomalies.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, so a malware score of 0 is justified across the board.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is correct.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present; 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code—a static version string with a copyright notice—the risk is negligible. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns. No changes to scores are necessary.",
