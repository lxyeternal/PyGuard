  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only sets a variable.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version string, and copyright statement present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a simple string assignment for the __version__ variable, which is a common practice for package versioning. The copyright statement indicates authorship but does not affect security. No untrusted data input, no suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscated or unusual code structures. The code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to identify the package version and contains no indicators of malicious behavior.",
