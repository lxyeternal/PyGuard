  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that assigns a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- It contains a copyright statement with the year 2025.\n- No dynamic code, inputs, or external data are involved.\n- The code is straightforward and conventional for version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, only a variable assignment, no sinks or flows.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; the code is benign.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with an anomaly noted: the future copyright year (2025).\n- **Analysis:** The future year might be a typo or placeholder but does not pose a security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a minor anomaly.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Only a simple assignment and a docstring; no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard version declaration.\n- **Score justification:** All zeroes are appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward assignment.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes seem correct.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same straightforward assignment, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes are justified.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a simple, benign version declaration.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is not a security concern.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in any report.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
