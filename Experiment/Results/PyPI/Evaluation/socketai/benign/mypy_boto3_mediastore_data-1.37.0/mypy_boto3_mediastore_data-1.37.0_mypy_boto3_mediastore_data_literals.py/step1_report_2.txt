{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for boto3 mediastore-data service literals and related constants.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and the assignment of various Literal type variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code only assigns string literals to type variables; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous string literal types used for type annotations in boto3. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version and declares constants for various AWS service names, resource types, paginator names, regions, and storage classes. All variables are assigned fixed string literals, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that provides type annotations for AWS service literals. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The design is static and standard for type definitions.",
