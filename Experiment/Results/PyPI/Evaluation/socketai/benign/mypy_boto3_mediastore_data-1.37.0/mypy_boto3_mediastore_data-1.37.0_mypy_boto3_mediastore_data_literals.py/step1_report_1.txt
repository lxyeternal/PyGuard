  "purpose": "Define type literals for mediastore-data service and other AWS service identifiers for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; type definitions for various string literals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, sinks, or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "N/A — static definitions; no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious logic. The code is purely type annotations with conditional import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines a series of string literal types for AWS SDK components. All definitions are static, fixed string literals, and there are no dynamic or external inputs, commands, or code execution paths. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations for type checking support, with no malicious intent or malicious code embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions used for static type checking, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is standard in nature, serving as a utility module for type annotations.",
