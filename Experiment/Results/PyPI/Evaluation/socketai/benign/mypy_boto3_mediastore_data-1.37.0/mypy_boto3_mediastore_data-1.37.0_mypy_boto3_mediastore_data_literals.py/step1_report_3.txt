  "purpose": "Define type annotations for mediastore-data service literals and other AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs or sensitive data; only static type definitions and annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution or obfuscation. The copyright year is set to 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains static type alias definitions for various AWS-related string literals, utilizing conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. The code includes extensive definitions of literals for AWS services, regions, and other constants. No code executes dynamically, no external inputs are processed, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The license and copyright statement are benign. There are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or anomalous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward, safe type alias definition module for AWS service literals. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate type checking and code completion. The high confidence score reflects the benign and standard nature of this code.",
