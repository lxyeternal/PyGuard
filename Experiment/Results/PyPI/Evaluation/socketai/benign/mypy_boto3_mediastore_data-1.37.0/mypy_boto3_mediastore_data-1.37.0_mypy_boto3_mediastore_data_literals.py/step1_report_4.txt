  "purpose": "Define string literal types for boto3 mediastore-data service and related AWS service identifiers for type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external effects are present; the code does not write or send data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple type aliases for specific string literals related to AWS services. All the data are static string constants used for type hinting. There are no dynamic inputs, user data processing, or external communications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, static definition of string literal types for AWS SDK type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
