  "purpose": "Defines static type literals for AWS mediastore-data service and various AWS service identifiers, resource types, regions, and other constants for type checking and code completion.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers and related constants, with conditional import handling for Python version compatibility. There are no dynamic data flows, external inputs, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code serves as a utility for static type checking. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with its benign, static nature. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward, non-executable content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but may be a placeholder.",
