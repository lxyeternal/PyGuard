  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess potential security concerns, verify the presence of malicious code, and evaluate the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for mediastore-data and AWS services; static type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely static, with no dynamic data, no external inputs, and no suspicious behavior. It uses conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code is benign, serving as a utility for type checking.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining AWS service string literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static definitions, no data flow, no external data handling, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign. No security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS service literals, with extensive constants.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, straightforward type alias definitions. The future-dated copyright (2025) is benign, possibly a placeholder or typo.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions for AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS resource identifiers, static type aliases.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No data processing, no external inputs, no malicious code. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe static, declarative type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers and related constants.\n- **Behavior:** No dynamic code, no data flows involving untrusted sources, no external communications, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, consistent with the static nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard utility module for static type annotations, commonly used in typed Python projects. It does not contain any executable logic beyond type alias declarations, and all data are fixed string literals. The conditional import ensures compatibility across Python versions but does not introduce any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action is needed. The code is a straightforward, safe set of type definitions for AWS SDK type annotations.",
