  "purpose": "Define type literals for mediastore-data service and related AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, version check for typing.Literal or typing_extensions.Literal, and static literal assignments for various AWS identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code solely defines constants and type annotations without any data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code consists only of type alias definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS service identifiers, conditionally importing the correct Literal based on Python version. It defines multiple string literal types for various AWS resources, services, and configurations. There are no input/output operations, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The presence of a copyright notice and documentation link suggests maintenance intent. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS service identifiers. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to enable type checking and code clarity in projects utilizing these AWS services.",
