  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS SDK components, with conditional import handling for Python versions.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or execution paths are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate static type checking and code completion.\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for mediastore-data and other AWS services.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, benign, and purely for type annotations.  \n**Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with extensive definitions of AWS service names and constants.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes static definitions, no external data, no malicious intent.  \n**Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on mediastore-data literals and AWS identifiers.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is static, benign, with no malicious behavior.  \n**Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, defining string literals for AWS services.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes static nature, no dynamic code, no suspicious behavior.  \n**Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Again, static type definitions for AWS identifiers, with version handling.  \n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is benign, static, and purpose is for type annotations.  \n**Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations with no malicious or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** All are 1, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or reasoning.\n- The code is a standard utility module for static type checking, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward, static code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and safe for use in type annotations.",
