  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured data model for location scoring data, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concerns mainly related to URL validation, which is standard. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in production environments."
