  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes for handling various HTTP errors related to the WalkScore API.\n- Functions parse HTTP responses to extract status codes, messages, and error types, then raise exceptions accordingly.\n- The code uses standard patterns for error handling; no suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code relies on standard library features and a third-party `validator_collection` import, which isn't used in the snippet but is harmless.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present.\n- Use of `print()` statements for logging error types is benign but not ideal for production; it doesn't introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and consistent with standard error handling practices.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  Minor typo: `InvalidCoordinatesError` message says \"invlaid\" instead of \"invalid\" — this is a typo, not a security flaw.  \n  The `DEFAULT_ERROR_CODES` uses some non-standard codes (e.g., 2, 30, 31), but this is likely based on API-specific conventions, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**\n\n  - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0. This is appropriate; no malicious code is present.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Security risk score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1–0.2). Given the code's purpose and no malicious activity, this seems reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk > 0.5, and the analysis supports that. The minimal risk scores are justified by the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as standard error handling with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n  The scores are consistent; all indicate low or no malware, obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Use of `print()` statements:**  \n  Not malicious but not ideal for production logging. Not a security concern.\n\n- **Error code mappings:**  \n  Some non-standard codes are used, but this is likely API-specific, not malicious.\n\n- **Potential improvements:**  \n  Use proper logging instead of `print()`, fix typo in error message, but these are not security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, consistent with error handling code, no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign error handling module for an API client. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation.  \n- The low security risk scores are justified.  \n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or specific recommendations.",
