  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes and functions for parsing HTTP responses and raising appropriate errors based on status codes and response content.\n- It relies on standard HTTP response attributes (`status_code`, `json()`, `text`, `decode()`).\n- No suspicious or malicious code, such as code injection, external network activity, or data exfiltration, is evident.\n- The code does not perform any untrusted code execution or write operations.\n- Use of `print()` statements for error logging is benign but not ideal for production.\n- The `validators` import is unused in the snippet, which is harmless but could be cleaned up.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Typo in `InvalidCoordinatesError` docstring:** \"invlaid\" should be \"invalid\". This is a minor documentation typo, not a security issue.\n- **Unusual error code keys in `DEFAULT_ERROR_CODES`:** codes like 2, 30, 31 are non-standard HTTP status codes, but they are likely application-specific error codes, not malicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Inconsistent error code mappings:** For example, `404` maps to `'ResourceNotFoundError'`, which is fine, but `2`, `30`, `31` are non-standard and their handling depends on the API's internal error code system. Not inherently malicious but could be confusing.\n- **`print()` statements:** Used for debugging or logging, not a security flaw but not ideal for production logging.\n\n### Malware or malicious behavior:\n\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- No external network activity, code injection, or data leaks detected.\n- The code is purely for error handling.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** The overall security risk is low, but since this is error handling code, a minimal risk score of 0.1-0.2 is reasonable, reflecting that improper error handling could potentially lead to issues but not malicious.\n\n### Specific report comments:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- *Score:* Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1  \n- *Verdict:* Appropriate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- *Score:* Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2  \n- *Verdict:* Slightly higher, but justified given the minimal risk.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- *Score:* Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1  \n- *Verdict:* Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- *Score:* Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.0  \n- *Verdict:* Slightly lower, acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- *Score:* Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1  \n- *Verdict:* Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, standard error handling module for an API client.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent or activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly related to error handling robustness, not security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The existing scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments if needed, but overall they are consistent with the analysis.",
