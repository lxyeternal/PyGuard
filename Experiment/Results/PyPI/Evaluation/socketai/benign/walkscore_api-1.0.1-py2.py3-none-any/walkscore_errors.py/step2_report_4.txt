  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The module provides error handling classes and functions for processing HTTP responses from the WalkScore API, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Code presence:** All classes and functions are standard, focusing on parsing responses and raising exceptions.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues found. The use of `print()` for error logging is benign but not ideal for production; however, it's not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard error handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Code review:** Same as above, straightforward error classes and parsing functions.\n- **Potential anomalies:** Use of custom error codes, but within a controlled context.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, the code is a typical error handler.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard error handling for API responses.\n- **Code review:** No signs of malicious activity; functions parse responses safely.\n- **Potential concerns:** Use of response content for error messages is standard; no external network activity or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate error handling code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, standard error management.\n- **Code review:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports, error handling for API responses.\n- **Code review:** No malicious code, no backdoors, no suspicious data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly a safe, standard error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code is purely for error handling, with no malicious payloads, code injection, or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal security risk due to potential information leakage via error messages, but nothing severe.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured error handling module for an API client.\n- No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The use of `print()` statements is not malicious but could be improved for production logging.\n- The custom error codes and mappings are within expected patterns for such modules.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to error message exposure, not active threats)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and appropriate for its purpose. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.",
