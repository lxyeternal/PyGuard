{
  "purpose": "This module provides error handling classes and functions for processing HTTP responses related to the WalkScore API, including parsing error messages and raising appropriate exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the `http_response` object, specifically accessing `status_code`, `json()`, `text`, and `decode('utf-8')` methods.",
  "sinks": "The code raises exceptions based on the parsed error data; no untrusted data is written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input (http_response) -> parse_http_error() -> check_for_errors() -> raise exceptions if errors are detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on `http_response` methods without validating their trustworthiness; however, these are standard for HTTP response objects. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The use of print statements for debugging or error logs could be considered a minor anomaly but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for different error scenarios, which inherit from `WalkScoreError`. The functions `parse_http_error()` and `check_for_errors()` process HTTP responses to identify and raise relevant exceptions based on status codes and response content. The `DEFAULT_ERROR_CODES` and `ERROR_TYPES` dictionaries map status codes and error types to classes or strings. The code uses standard patterns for error handling and does not include any code injection, malicious data leaks, or external communications. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activity are detected. The use of `print()` statements for error type logging is benign but may not be optimal for production; it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The module performs standard error handling for an API client, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It processes input responses safely without executing untrusted code or leaking data.",
