{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom error classes and functions for handling HTTP errors related to the WalkScore API, mainly for error parsing and raising appropriate exceptions.",
  "sources": "HTTP response objects in the parse_http_error and check_for_errors functions",
  "sinks": "The functions raise exceptions based on error codes, but do not involve untrusted data affecting system state or data exfiltration",
  "flows": "HTTP response object (untrusted data) is parsed for error information, which then determines which exception to raise",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom error classes and mappings for handling API error responses. The parse_http_error function extracts status code and message from HTTP responses, which is standard practice. The check_for_errors function raises exceptions based on parsed error types, following a straightforward pattern. No external or hidden data manipulation, code injection, or malicious behavior detected. The module focuses solely on error handling for an API and uses only standard library features and a third-party validator_collection, which is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API error handling module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It processes error responses and raises appropriate exceptions. There are no suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
