{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom error classes and functions for handling HTTP errors related to the WalkScore API, including parsing HTTP responses and raising appropriate exceptions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'http_response' object in the 'parse_http_error' and 'check_for_errors' functions, which are used to determine error types based on HTTP status codes and response content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'raise' statements that throw exceptions based on error parsing results. The code could raise various custom exceptions derived from 'WalkScoreError'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'http_response' to 'parse_http_error' to extract status code and message, then to 'check_for_errors' to determine if an exception should be raised based on the parsed error type and message.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code behaviors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code mainly performs error handling and does not include any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes to categorize API errors, with clear hierarchy and descriptive comments. The 'parse_http_error' function attempts to extract status code and error messages from the HTTP response, handling various potential formats and exceptions, such as JSON decoding and decoding response content. The 'check_for_errors' function invokes parsing and raises exceptions accordingly. The mapping dictionaries 'DEFAULT_ERROR_CODES' and 'ERROR_TYPES' translate status codes and error type strings into exceptions. All functions perform straightforward error handling based on expected API response structures, with no indications of malicious or sabotage activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP error parsing and exception raising for an API client. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is solely to handle API errors gracefully. The overall security risk is minimal, with no suspicious or malicious signals identified.",
