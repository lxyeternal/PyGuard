{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes and functions for handling HTTP errors related to the WalkScore API, including parsing responses and raising appropriate errors based on status codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the http_response object, including status_code, json content, text, and potentially decoding the response.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are the use of http_response.text and decoding content, but these are used solely for error messaging purposes within exception handling.",
  "flows": "The flow involves parsing the status_code and response content, determining the error type, and raising corresponding exceptions if errors are detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. It uses standard exception handling and typical HTTP response parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for various HTTP error conditions related to the WalkScore API. Functions parse_http_error and check_for_errors handle error detection and reporting based on HTTP status codes and response content. The mappings of status codes to error types appear standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The code relies on the validators import but does not utilize it in the provided snippet, which seems benign. All data handling appears to be standard error processing without any suspicious data flows or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for error handling in an API client module. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It primarily manages API error responses and raises appropriate exceptions. Overall, the code appears safe and free of malware or malicious behavior.",
