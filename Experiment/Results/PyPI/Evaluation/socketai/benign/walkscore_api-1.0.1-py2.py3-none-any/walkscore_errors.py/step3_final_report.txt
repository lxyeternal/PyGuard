  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and functions for parsing HTTP responses related to the WalkScore API, facilitating error handling based on response status codes and content.",
  "sources": "Reads response.status_code, response.json(), response.text, response.decode()",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions based on parsed error type and message",
  "flows": "Response attributes are parsed to determine error type and message, which are then used to raise exceptions",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() statements for logging error types; minor typo in 'invlaid' instead of 'invalid' in docstring",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard error handling module for an API client, with classes representing various HTTP errors and functions to parse responses and raise appropriate exceptions. It relies on typical response attributes and handles different error scenarios, including timeouts, SSL errors, and custom API error codes. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of print() for logging is benign but not ideal for production. The non-standard error codes are likely API-specific. Overall, the code is straightforward, readable, and aligns with best practices for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured error handling module with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose. No adjustments are necessary.",
