      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured multi-backend HTTP utility library with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concern related to fallback mechanisms is explicitly warned and is a standard practice, not malicious. The overall security posture is high, and the scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package's __init__.py but uses an unsafe pattern to load version info. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary risk stems from executing external code, which could be mitigated by replacing exec() with safer alternatives. The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score could be slightly increased to 0.5 to better reflect the potential danger."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured data model for location scoring data, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concerns mainly related to URL validation, which is standard. Overall, the code is benign and suitable for use in production environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the use of 'http' instead of 'https' for the API endpoint, which should be corrected to enhance security. The current malware and obfuscation scores are accurate; the security risk score should be increased modestly to account for the insecure URL scheme."
