  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for WalkScore, retrieving scores securely, with environment variable fallback, proper validation, and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is reasonable. The code does not exhibit malicious behavior, and the scoring reflects that.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client behavior with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API wrapper, proper validation, no malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with a note on standard practices and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code appears secure and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The only notable concern is the use of 'http' instead of 'https', which could expose data in transit, but this is a configuration issue, not malicious code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to potential insecure transmission, but not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is correct. The use of 'http' is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious code or malware present.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, consistent with clear code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, which is appropriate given the use of environment variables and standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n- The only potential improvement could be to note the 'http' URL in Report 5 as a security concern rather than a malicious activity, which the report already does.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor security concern due to 'http' usage, but not malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a secure, well-structured API client with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores and reasoning across all reports are appropriate.",
