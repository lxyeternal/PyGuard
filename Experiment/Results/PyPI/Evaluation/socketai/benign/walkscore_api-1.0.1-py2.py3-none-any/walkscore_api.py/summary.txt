  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the use of 'http' instead of 'https' for the API endpoint, which should be corrected to enhance security. The current malware and obfuscation scores are accurate; the security risk score should be increased modestly to account for the insecure URL scheme."
