  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, scores, and overall risk.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the core issue: the use of `exec()` to read and execute the contents of `__version__.py`.\n- The `__version__.py` file is typically a small, controlled file defining a version string, e.g., `__version__ = '1.0.0'`.\n- Using `exec()` on a local, controlled file is not best practice but is common in some legacy or quick scripts. However, if the file is tampered with, malicious code could be executed.\n- None of the reports identify actual malicious code in the current codebase; the concern is about potential risks if the version file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **exec()** on `__version__.py` is the only potential security concern.\n- No evidence of malicious code in the current version.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network activity.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The use of `exec()` for version extraction is unconventional and risky.\n- A safer alternative would be to read the file content and parse it (e.g., using `ast.literal_eval()` or a simple regex), avoiding code execution.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.5, reflecting moderate concern due to `exec()`.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes, given the current code state, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The risk is primarily about potential malicious code execution if `__version__.py` is tampered with.\n- Since the file is part of the package and typically controlled, the actual risk is low, but the pattern is insecure.\n- The scores of 0.3 to 0.5 are reasonable, indicating moderate concern.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in identifying the use of `exec()` as the main concern.\n- They do not attribute malicious intent or behavior, only potential risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 to 0.5 (moderate, due to `exec()` usage)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.4 (balanced between the reports' assessments)\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Replace `exec()` with safer alternatives, e.g., `ast.literal_eval()` or simple string parsing.\n- Ensure `__version__.py` is protected and verified during package development.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code has a moderate security concern due to the use of `exec()` on a local file, but no actual malicious activity is present. The risk scores are appropriate, and the main mitigation is to avoid executing external code.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nNo evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is code safety, not malicious intent.",
