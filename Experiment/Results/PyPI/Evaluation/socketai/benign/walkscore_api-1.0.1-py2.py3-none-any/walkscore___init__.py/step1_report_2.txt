  "purpose": "To provide an entry point for the WalkScore API Python bindings, importing relevant modules and setting version information.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__version__.py' file to get the version number.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "File read operation to obtain version info; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute code read from a file, which can be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with. This is an uncommon practice in secure code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and dynamically reads version information from a file using 'exec'. The use of 'exec' on a file read from the local filesystem could be exploited if the file contents are malicious, but in typical package development, this file is controlled and not user-supplied. No other suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform any network communication or handle sensitive data beyond version info.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard package initialization script, with the only notable risk being the use of 'exec' to read version info. This practice can be a security concern if the version file is compromised. Overall, there is no malware present, and no malicious intent evident.",
