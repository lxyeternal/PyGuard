{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for WalkScore API bindings, loading version info and importing core classes.",
  "sources": "Reads '__version__.py' file to get version info from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Executes the contents of '__version__.py' via exec(), which could run arbitrary code if that file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Reads and executes version file -> sets '__version__' -> imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run contents of '__version__.py' introduces potential security risk if the file is compromised or malicious. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads version information and imports modules. The main concern is the use of exec() on a local version file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with. However, since the file is a local, presumably controlled file, and no external inputs are involved, the risk is minimal. No other malicious behaviors or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for package initialization, with the exception of the exec() call, which could be a security concern if the version file is maliciously altered. Overall, it does not contain malicious intent but warrants cautious handling of the version file.",
