  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package's __init__.py but uses an unsafe pattern to load version info. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary risk stems from executing external code, which could be mitigated by replacing exec() with safer alternatives. The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score could be slightly increased to 0.5 to better reflect the potential danger."
