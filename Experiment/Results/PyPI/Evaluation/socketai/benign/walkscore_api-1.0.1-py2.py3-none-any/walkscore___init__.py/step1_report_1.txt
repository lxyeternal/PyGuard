  "purpose": "To provide Python bindings for the WalkScore API by exposing relevant classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__version__.py' file to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the contents of '__version__.py', which could potentially run malicious code if the file is tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code reads the '__version__.py' file (source) and executes its content with exec() (sink), which could lead to execution of malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from a file is risky; no validation or sanitization of the file contents is performed. Reliance on exec() for version extraction is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard modules and modules from the 'walkscore' package. The critical operation is reading the '__version__.py' file and executing its contents using exec(), which poses a security risk if the file has been tampered with. The rest of the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py, with no hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is typical for a Python package's initialization but contains a security concern due to the use of exec() on an external file. If the '__version__.py' file is compromised, malicious code could be executed during import. Overall, this is a moderate risk, mainly stemming from the exec() usage.",
