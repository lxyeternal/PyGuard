  "purpose": "To provide (unofficial) Python bindings for the WalkScore API, enabling users to access walk score data through imported classes.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__.py file using open() and exec(), importing modules walkscore.api and walkscore.locationscore.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes code from __version__.py, which could potentially be malicious if the file contains harmful code.",
  "flows": "The file reads __version__.py content and executes it via exec(), then imports specific classes from other modules, which are benign unless the executed code is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on an external file (__version__.py), which could execute arbitrary code if the file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly sets up module metadata and imports. The key concern is the use of exec() to execute the contents of __version__.py. If __version__.py is controlled or tampered with, it could contain malicious code. The rest of the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities are present. The reliance on exec() introduces a potential security risk if the version file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in some packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a typical package setup script with a notable risk associated with executing external code via exec(). If __version__.py is secure and trusted, the overall risk is low. However, the exec() usage warrants caution as it could execute malicious code if the file is compromised.",
