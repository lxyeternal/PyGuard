  "purpose": "This script initializes a Python package for WalkScore API bindings, loading version info and importing key modules.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__version__.py' file from the current directory to get version info.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data externally or process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads version file -> loads version info -> imports API modules; no external data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from '__version__.py' is potentially unsafe, as it executes arbitrary code. This is an uncommon practice and could be exploited if the version file is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to set up a Python package by importing modules and extracting version info. It retrieves the version number by executing the contents of '__version__.py' within a dictionary, which is a security risk if that file is malicious or modified. Otherwise, the rest of the code simply imports classes and defines module exports without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package initialization with a notable security concern: executing external code via 'exec' to load version info. No malicious behavior or external data leaks are evident, but the use of 'exec' should be carefully managed to prevent potential code execution risks.",
