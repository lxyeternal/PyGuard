  "purpose": "To load the version information for the package by executing the contents of __version__.py.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__.py file and executing its contents with exec().",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of malicious code if __version__.py is tampered with.",
  "flows": "Reading __version__.py -> exec() -> execution of code within __version__.py.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to parse a version file, which is unconventional and risky; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads __version__.py from the current directory and executes its contents using exec(), extracting the __version__ variable. This pattern poses a security risk if the version file is compromised, as arbitrary code could be executed. The rest of the code involves straightforward imports and module exports. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the unsafe execution pattern, which could be mitigated by safer parsing methods. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the straightforward nature of the code. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.3-0.5), reflecting the risk associated with exec() on a file that could be tampered with.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package's __init__.py but uses an unsafe pattern to load version info. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary risk stems from executing external code, which could be mitigated by replacing exec() with safer alternatives. The current scores are appropriate, but the risk score could be slightly increased to 0.5 to better reflect the potential danger.",
