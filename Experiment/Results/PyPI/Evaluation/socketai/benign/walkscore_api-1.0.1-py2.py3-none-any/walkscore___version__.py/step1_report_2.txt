  "purpose": "Set the version string of the Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, only setting a version string. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a version variable, which is standard practice in Python packages. It contains no input handling, no data processing, and no security-relevant operations. There is no obfuscation, no malicious code, and no unusual behaviors present. The file is likely part of a larger package but alone shows no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, solely setting a version string with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
