  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is minimal, only assigning a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input/output, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Structure:**\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for Python package metadata.\n   - The only operation is assigning a string to a variable.\n   - No anomalies or deviations from typical practices are observed.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the simplicity of the code.\n   - Security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence is 1 across all reports, which is justified given the clear and minimal code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about external dependencies or context that could introduce risks.\n   - The reports do not suggest any hidden or embedded malicious code, which would be highly unusual in such a minimal snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign declaration of a version string.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications to the scores or reasoning are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code fragment is entirely benign and typical for package versioning.",
