  "sources": "No external data sources; only a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow, input, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code declares UTF-8 encoding and assigns a version string. It contains no input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with consistent scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The simplicity and standard nature of the code support the conclusion that it is non-threatening.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
