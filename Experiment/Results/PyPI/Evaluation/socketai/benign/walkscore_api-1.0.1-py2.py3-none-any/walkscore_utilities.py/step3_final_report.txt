  "purpose": "Utility functions for data encoding and HTTP response error handling in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters (response bytes, status_code, headers).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted response data processed in json parsing and decoding functions.",
  "flows": "Response data is decoded and parsed, then used to determine error states or returned as-is.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of static CA bundle path is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility tasks: encoding strings to UTF-8, checking HTTP response status, parsing JSON responses, and raising errors accordingly. It relies on trusted external libraries and performs no network activity or data exfiltration. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The functions are straightforward, with clear intent and safe practices. The static path for CA certificates is typical for TLS verification. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects the utility nature of the functions and the absence of vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood.",
