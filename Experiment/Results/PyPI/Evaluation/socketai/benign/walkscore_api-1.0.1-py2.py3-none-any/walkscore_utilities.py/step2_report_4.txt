  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data encoding and HTTP error checking; no suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with a focus on response validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; JSON parsing is standard, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The risk score is low, as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for response error checking.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; standard handling of response data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears benign. The zero malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with standard handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; safe handling of response data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable given the context.\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering network response handling. Malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for string encoding and response validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; standard operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is straightforward, and the scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly very low (0.1), with one at 0.2. Given the code's nature—utility functions with no external system modifications or network activity—these are appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard, well-understood operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Use of external validation libraries (assumed safe).\n- No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling.\n- The CA_BUNDLE_PATH is static but standard for TLS verification.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to network response handling, which is typical for such utility functions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain or malicious activity.",
