{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling strings, checking HTTP responses, and managing certificates within the walkscore library.",
  "sources": "Reads data from os.path, sys.version_info, and response parameters. Uses external libraries for validation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of response data when decoding bytes and parsing JSON. No untrusted data is directly written or sent over network.",
  "flows": "Response data is decoded and validated; errors are parsed and raised if necessary. No data is transmitted or stored outside the scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard validation functions and path handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical utility functions: string encoding, HTTP response validation, and error parsing. It safely handles response data, decoding bytes only after type checks, and uses external validators which are assumed to be trustworthy. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The path for certificate bundle is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility code for handling HTTP responses and data encoding, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
