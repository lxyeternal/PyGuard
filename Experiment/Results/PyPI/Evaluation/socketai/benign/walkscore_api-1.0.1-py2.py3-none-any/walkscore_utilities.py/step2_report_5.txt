  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data encoding and HTTP error checking. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, using standard libraries and practices. No signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score aligns with this.  \n- **Verdict:** The score seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions; potential JSON parsing from responses, but no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; JSON parsing is standard. The risk score is low and justified.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions; no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n- **Assessment:** Completely benign; no security concerns.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Utility functions; potential decoding of response data, but standard practice. No malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; low risk.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions; no suspicious code or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, and the low risk score is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores seem correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is standard utility functions.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports confirm straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security risk due to standard operations.\n\n**Given the code and reports, my overall estimates are:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, just standard utility functions with minimal risk)\n\n### Final Remarks:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No evidence suggests any malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified based on the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign utility code used for data encoding and HTTP error handling.  \n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.  \n- The overall security posture is very high, with negligible risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0.05**",
