{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling string encoding and HTTP response error checking in the walkscore library.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (`sys.version_info`), environment path (`os.path`, `__file__`), and input parameters (`response`, `status_code`, `headers`).",
  "sinks": "Uses `validators.json()` to parse JSON data from responses, which could be a point if maliciously crafted responses are provided.",
  "flows": "Input data (response, status_code, headers) flows through validation and error parsing functions. No external or untrusted data is directly used to execute code or access system resources beyond standard validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious external network calls within this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs string encoding checks and HTTP response validation. It uses external validation functions that are presumably safe. No external system calls, network operations, or code execution based on untrusted data are observed. The only point of concern could be parsing JSON from responses, but this is standard practice and not malicious by itself. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility implementation for error checking and string encoding, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and aligned with typical application code.",
