  "sources": "File system for CA_BUNDLE_PATH; input parameters for check_for_errors (response, status_code, headers).",
  "sinks": "Potential decoding of response bytes; raising exceptions based on HTTP errors.",
  "flows": "Response bytes -> json validation -> error parsing -> exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of sys.version_info for Python version detection is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions: encoding responses, checking for errors, and raising exceptions. It uses third-party validators, which are typical. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or malicious logic are evident. The CA_BUNDLE_PATH is used for TLS certificate verification, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations safely without suspicious or malicious activity.",
