  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling string encoding and HTTP response error checking in the walkscore library.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.path, sys.version_info), input parameters (response, status_code, headers), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage of response.decode('utf-8') if response contains untrusted data, but it is a standard decoding operation. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (response, status_code, headers) are validated and processed; response data is decoded and checked for errors, then returned or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Use of decode is standard, no malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions: converting strings to UTF-8, and checking HTTP responses for errors, raising exceptions if needed. No malicious code, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration or backdoors. Use of environment variables and decoding responses is typical for network-related operations. No suspicious patterns or anomalous behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be safe and straightforward utility code with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It simply performs standard error checking and string handling.",
