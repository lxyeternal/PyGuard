  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe utility functions that perform string encoding and HTTP response error handling.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and trusted third-party validators.\n- The functions are straightforward, with no network activity or data exfiltration.\n- CA_BUNDLE_PATH is a static path for TLS certificates, typical in such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is standard, and the low risk score aligns with the benign analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, potential JSON parsing point but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is consistent. Parsing JSON from responses is common and not malicious unless the response is malicious, which isn't claimed here. The low malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is thorough. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe slightly higher risk score (0.2) might be conservative but acceptable given the decoding of response data. Still, no actual malicious activity is observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Straightforward utility code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the utility nature of the code. Slightly higher in some reports (0.2), which is acceptable given the response decoding, but still not indicating any significant security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard utility code with no known vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-understood, and free from malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The reports are accurate, and the overall security posture is benign.",
