  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code in detail.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe code implements a multi-backend HTTP client abstraction with support for requests, urlfetch, pycurl, and urllib2. It includes retry logic with exponential backoff, SSL verification options, proxy support, and error handling. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility library designed for robustness and flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of requested features:** Retry logic, proxy support, SSL verification, multiple backends. All are present.\n- **Malicious code or obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials:** None.\n- **Dynamic code execution or obfuscation:** No.\n- **Suspicious behaviors:** No signs of malicious activities like data exfiltration, sabotage, or backdoors.\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n- **Reports 1-5** consistently conclude that the code is a legitimate, multi-backend HTTP utility library with no malicious intent, only some fallback mechanisms that could reduce security but are explicitly documented.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above 0 (0.1-0.2), mainly due to fallback to less secure libraries like urllib2 without SSL verification. This is standard fallback behavior, not malicious.\n- **Overall risk:** Low, given the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n### Justification:\n- **No malware:** The code is a standard HTTP client abstraction, no signs of malicious payloads.\n- **No obfuscation:** Clear, well-documented code.\n- **Risk scores:** The low scores are justified given the fallback to insecure methods, but this is explicitly warned and configurable, not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the fallback to insecure methods, I would assign a slightly higher risk score of **0.2**, but still low, as this is a known trade-off and explicitly warned about.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No evidence of malicious intent.\n- The fallback mechanisms, while potentially insecure, are documented and are common in open-source libraries for compatibility.\n- No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**       | **0.2** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports, with a slight adjustment to the risk score due to the fallback to less secure libraries, which is a known and documented limitation rather than malicious behavior.\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is safe, legitimate, and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The low risk is justified by the fallback mechanisms, which are explicitly warned and configurable.",
