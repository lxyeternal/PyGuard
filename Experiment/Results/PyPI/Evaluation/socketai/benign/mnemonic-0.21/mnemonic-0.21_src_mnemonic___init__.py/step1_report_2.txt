  "purpose": "This code imports the Mnemonic class from a local module and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.mnemonic import Mnemonic)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Mnemonic from a sibling module and specifies that Mnemonic should be publicly accessible. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded secrets, or external communications. The structure and syntax are typical for a Python module's export statement. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import and export operation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
