  "purpose": "Import the Mnemonic class from a local module and expose it for external use.",
  "sources": "Reading the local module .mnemonic to import Mnemonic.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import from .mnemonic to local namespace, then expose via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class and re-exports it, following standard Python practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. No data processing, external communication, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no security risks or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe and straightforward component.",
