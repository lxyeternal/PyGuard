{
  "purpose": "This code module is designed to import and expose the 'Mnemonic' class from a local module named 'mnemonic'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'Mnemonic' class from the 'mnemonic' module that is part of the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs; the code simply exports the class for external use.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'Mnemonic' from a local module and making it available for import elsewhere; no untrusted data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It only sets up module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'Mnemonic' from a local module and exports it via __all__, which is standard practice for Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The structure and content are typical for a simple package interface file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export setup with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is a benign part of a Python package that exposes the 'Mnemonic' class.",
