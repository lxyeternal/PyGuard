{
  "purpose": "This code module imports the Mnemonic class and exports it for external use, likely as part of a larger library related to mnemonic phrase management.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .mnemonic imports the Mnemonic class within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports Mnemonic from a local module and makes it available externally; no data flow from external sources or untrusted input is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only importing a class from a local module and defining an __all__ list for exports. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package index file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger package focused on mnemonic operations.",
