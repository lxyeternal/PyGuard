{
  "purpose": "The code exports the Mnemonic class from the mnemonic module, likely for external use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a class from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this minimal code fragment; it only performs an import and an export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple and standard; no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Mnemonic and makes it available for external use via __all__. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors. The simplicity suggests it's part of a larger project and does not contain malicious logic itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to re-export a class for modular code organization. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
