{
  "purpose": "The code implements standard cryptographic functions for mnemonic seed phrase generation, validation, seed derivation, and HD wallet key creation following BIP39 and BIP32 standards.",
  "sources": "Reads input hex data from command line argument or stdin; loads wordlist files from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Outputs mnemonic phrase; no data leaks or external network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Hex input -> bytes -> mnemonic generation -> seed derivation -> HD master key serialization -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External wordlist dependency is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses well-established cryptographic libraries and practices, with clear structure and no signs of malicious behavior. It loads wordlists from local files, which is typical for localization. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The cryptographic functions are correctly implemented, and the overall logic aligns with standard specifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of mnemonic seed phrase handling and HD wallet key derivation. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The supply chain risk appears negligible.",
