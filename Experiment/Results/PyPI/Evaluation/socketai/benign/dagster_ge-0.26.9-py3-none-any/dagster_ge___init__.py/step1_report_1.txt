  "purpose": "This code registers the 'dagster-ge' library version and exposes a factory function for validation operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules and variables (__version__ from dagster_ge.version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Import modules → Register library with version → Expose factory function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to Dagster, registers the library version using a registry pattern, and defines an export list. All operations are straightforward and involve no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious intent or unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard initialization and registration snippet for a library, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
