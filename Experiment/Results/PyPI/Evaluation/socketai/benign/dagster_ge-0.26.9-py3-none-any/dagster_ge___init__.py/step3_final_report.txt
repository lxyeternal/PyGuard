{
  "purpose": "Register the 'dagster-ge' library version and expose the validation operation factory for external use within the Dagster framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_ge.factory', and 'dagster_ge.version'; registration call to 'DagsterLibraryRegistry.register'; export via '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data, nor does it perform network or system commands.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to registration call, which registers the library version; the factory function is exposed for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, straightforward, and performs a standard library registration pattern. It imports known modules, registers the library version, and exposes a factory function. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The code structure is typical for plugin initialization within the Dagster ecosystem. All signals indicate benign, non-malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup snippet for a Dagster plugin. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
