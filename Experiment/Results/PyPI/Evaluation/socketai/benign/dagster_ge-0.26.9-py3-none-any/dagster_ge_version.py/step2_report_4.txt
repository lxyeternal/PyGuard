  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. This is a standard practice in Python packages.\n   - No input sources, sinks, data flows, or executable logic are present.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of suspicious activity or security issues.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a high risk score; all are at 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Since the code is a straightforward version string assignment, higher risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** Confirmed to be a simple, standard version string assignment.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity of the code, I agree with the provided scores. There is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerability.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.",
