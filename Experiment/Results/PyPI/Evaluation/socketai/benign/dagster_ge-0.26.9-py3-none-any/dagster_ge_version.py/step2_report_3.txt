  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious operations. The code snippets are minimal and typical for package metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that this code is benign and standard practice in Python packaging. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, since there's no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk (0)**: Correct, no security issues are apparent.  \n   - **Confidence (1)**: Appropriate, given the simplicity and standard nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   All scores are zero or one, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, this code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.**",
