  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple assignment without data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration assigning a string to __version__. It contains no input/output, data flows, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no security concerns or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
