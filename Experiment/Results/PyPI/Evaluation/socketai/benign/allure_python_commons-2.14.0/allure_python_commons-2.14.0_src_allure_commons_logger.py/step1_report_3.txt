{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes for logging test results and attachments to a report directory, either writing to disk or storing in memory, as part of a testing or reporting framework.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables ('ALLURE_INDENT_OUTPUT'), method parameters (result, container, source, body, file_name), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "File system writes for report files and attachments, JSON serialization, copying files via shutil.copy2, and in-memory data storage.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> file naming and directory setup -> writing JSON data or copying files -> storing data in memory",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. The code performs straightforward report logging.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes report directories, writes JSON files with report data, copies attachment files, and stores report data in memory. No untrusted external inputs are processed in a manner that could cause code injection or data leaks. File operations are standard, with no dynamic code execution or unsafe practices. Environment variable usage is benign, controlling indentation for output formatting. The code uses standard libraries and third-party modules without suspicious activity. Overall, the implementation appears safe and typical for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of report logging classes with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It handles data safely, with no evidence of obfuscation or malware. The overall security risk score is low.",
