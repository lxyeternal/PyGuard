{
  "purpose": "The code provides logging mechanisms for Allure report results, containers, and attachments, supporting file system storage and in-memory data collection.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (ALLURE_INDENT_OUTPUT), reading source files for copying (source parameter), and input data (body parameter in report_attached_data).",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON files to the report directory, copying files to report directory, and writing attachment data to files.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences JSON formatting. report_result and report_container serialize data and write to disk. report_attached_file copies source files to report directory. report_attached_data writes string or binary data to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. File paths are constructed from parameters without sanitization, but no external input appears to be directly used for path construction in a dangerous way.",
  "analysis": "The code implements file and data logging functionalities with standard libraries, handling report data serialization and file copying. The environment variable affects output formatting but does not introduce security issues. No external inputs are used in a way that could lead to command injection or data leakage. The file operations are straightforward and do not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate logging tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of logging and reporting mechanisms for the Allure framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
