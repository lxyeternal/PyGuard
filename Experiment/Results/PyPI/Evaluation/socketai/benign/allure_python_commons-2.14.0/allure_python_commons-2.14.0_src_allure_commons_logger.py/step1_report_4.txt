{
  "purpose": "Provides logging functionalities for Allure reports, including writing report items to files and storing attachments in memory or disk.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ALLURE_INDENT_OUTPUT', method parameters such as 'result', 'container', 'source', 'file_name', 'body', and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "File system operations like writing JSON files, copying files, and writing binary data; in-memory data storage.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters or environment variables flows into file writing or in-memory data structures without external untrusted input manipulation beyond basic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code handles file paths securely using Path and avoids executing untrusted code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles report data and attachments, writing JSON files and copying files to specified directories. It utilizes environment variables for output formatting but does not use them in a way that introduces security risks. The data is serialized and stored either on disk or in memory, with no evident data leakage or malicious activity. No network operations, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of 'uuid' for filename generation is safe and does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard report logging tasks securely, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
