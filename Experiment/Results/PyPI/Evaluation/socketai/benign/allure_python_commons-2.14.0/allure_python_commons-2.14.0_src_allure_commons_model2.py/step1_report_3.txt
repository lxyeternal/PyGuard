  "purpose": "Define data structures for test result representation using attr classes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static definitions and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data handling paths; code is purely data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors identified. Patterns are straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of data class definitions using the attr library, which provides structured data containers for test results and related entities. No functions, input handling, or external interactions are present. The patterns and attribute defaults are standard. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as a schema or model for test data without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data structure definitions for test reporting, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely structural and does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted data in a harmful way.",
