  "purpose": "Define data structures for test result management and reporting.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for filename patterns and class attribute defaults.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data processing functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; classes only define data containers with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Factory' from 'attr' to initialize list attributes is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes using the 'attrs' library to structure test results, steps, attachments, labels, links, and status details. Patterns for filenames are stored as string templates. No input/output operations, network calls, or data manipulation methods are present. The code appears to be straightforward data modeling with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code segments were detected. The absence of any input handling or external communication indicates a very low risk of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model for test reporting, with no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
