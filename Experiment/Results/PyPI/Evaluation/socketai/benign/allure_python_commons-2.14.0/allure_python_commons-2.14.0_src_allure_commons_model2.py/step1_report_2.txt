{
  "purpose": "This code defines data classes for organizing test results, test steps, attachments, labels, links, and status details in a testing framework.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; the code solely defines data structures and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or data processing functions are present; code only declares classes and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only class definitions and constants without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of attributes and patterns appears standard and intended for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library 'attr' for class decoration, defines several pattern constants, and declares multiple data classes for test result modeling. No code executes untrusted input or performs operations that could be exploited maliciously. No network or system interactions are present. The overall structure is typical for test data management. No anomalies or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward data model for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
