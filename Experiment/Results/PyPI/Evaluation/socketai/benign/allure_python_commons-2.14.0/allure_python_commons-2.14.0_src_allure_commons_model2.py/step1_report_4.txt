  "purpose": "Define data structures for test result processing and storage, including test containers, items, steps, parameters, labels, links, attachments, and status details.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute code; all classes are data containers with default values.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward class and constant definitions with no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'attr' for class decoration, defines string pattern constants, and creates multiple data classes with attributes mostly set to default None or empty lists. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are detected. The code appears to serve as data structure definitions for testing frameworks or result reporting. All patterns and usage are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data structure definitions for test result management. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe and purely declarative.",
