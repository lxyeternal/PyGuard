{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes for test result management, including test results, steps, attachments, labels, links, and status details, serving as a schema for test reporting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code reads no input or data at runtime, only defines static data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions using 'attrs', with no functions, dynamic code, network operations, or external interactions. It employs standard practices like 'Factory' for mutable defaults. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's static, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious data schema for test reporting. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
