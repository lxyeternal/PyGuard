  "purpose": "Defines data classes for test result structures and constants related to test statuses and filename patterns.",
  "sources": "Constants for filename patterns, class attributes for test results, test steps, parameters, labels, links, and attachments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or user input; code primarily defines data schemas.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating potential malicious activity; code does not process or execute data directly.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'Factory' for default list creation is standard; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses 'attr' library to define data classes for organizing test result data, with no execution or data processing logic. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. There are no indications of malware, such as network communication, file manipulation, or environment exploitation. The code is straightforward and purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data schema definition for test result management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
