  "purpose": "Manage and delegate plugin operations for the 'allure' framework using a singleton pattern.",
  "sources": "Initialization of PluginManager, adding hooks from _hooks, attribute access via __getattr__",
  "sinks": "Attribute access delegation; no external data or untrusted inputs involved",
  "flows": "get_plugin_manager() initializes and caches PluginManager -> __getattr__ delegates attribute access to PluginManager",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; standard singleton and delegation pattern",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton plugin manager with lazy initialization, adding specific hooks, and attribute delegation. No external inputs, credentials, or system calls are present. The use of __getattr__ for delegation is safe and controlled. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard pattern observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe singleton plugin manager with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score accurately reflects its benign nature.",
