{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'allure-python-commons'. It prepares metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long_description via the get_readme() function; environment variables are not used; no user input or external data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no network or system commands are executed based on external input; setup parameters are hardcoded or derived locally.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, defining configuration variables, reading a local file, and invoking setup() with static and computed data. No data flows from external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard packaging tasks without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports standard modules, defines package metadata and dependencies, reads a local README file, and calls setup(). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of get_readme() to read a local file is common and safe. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely prepares the package metadata for distribution without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
