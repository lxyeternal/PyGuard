  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script for 'allure-python-commons'.\n- **Findings:** Reads README.md without issues; no suspicious code, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risk. The assessment appears accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard packaging.\n- **Findings:** Reads README.md without validation, which is typical; no suspicious code or external data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same packaging setup.\n- **Findings:** Reads local README; no untrusted input or external data; no network activity; no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** No security concerns; assessment is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup configuration.\n- **Findings:** Reads local file; no external input or network activity; standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** No malicious or risky behavior detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Typical packaging script.\n- **Findings:** Reads local README; no external data, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Risks:** The only minor point is the use of `open()` without exception handling in `get_readme()`, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and does not pose a security risk.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign zero scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as the script performs only package setup tasks with no security implications.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
