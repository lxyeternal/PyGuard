  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package 'allure-python-commons', used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": [
    "import os",
    "from setuptools import setup",

    "setup() function which loads package metadata and dependencies",
    "get_readme() reads the README.md file"

  "flows": [
    "import os and setuptools, define package info and dependencies",
    "get_readme() reads long description from README.md",
    "main() calls setup() with all package parameters"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected",
    "The get_readme() function reads a file without validation, which could potentially be exploited if the filename is manipulated, but this is standard for setup scripts",
    "No code execution based on untrusted input is present",
    "No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior observed"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data. The only minor point is that get_readme() reads a file without validation, but this is standard practice and not suspicious. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. All code appears to serve the purpose of package configuration and distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs expected package setup tasks without any suspicious activity.",
