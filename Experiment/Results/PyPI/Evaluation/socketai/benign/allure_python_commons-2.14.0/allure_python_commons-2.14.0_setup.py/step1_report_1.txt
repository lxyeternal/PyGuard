{
  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up a Python package named 'allure-python-commons' with its metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description. It also accesses environment variables indirectly through the setup process.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of setup() which could process external data if manipulated, but it uses controlled data. No direct data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "The get_readme() function reads static file content; the setup() function uses this content along with static metadata. There are no flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for setuptools. It reads a README file for long_description. The use of open() without exception handling is typical but not suspicious. The setup() call is standard. No code injection, malicious logic, or obfuscated code is present. No data leaks, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The code strictly performs package configuration tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or contain malicious payloads.",
