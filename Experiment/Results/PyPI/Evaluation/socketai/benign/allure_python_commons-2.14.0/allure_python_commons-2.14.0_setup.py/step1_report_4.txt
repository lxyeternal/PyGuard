{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for a Python package named 'allure-python-commons' including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; importing environment variables indirectly through setup functions; no explicit untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'setup()' function from setuptools, which handles installation processes and package configuration; no dangerous or insecure actions are taken.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the script mainly reads local files and sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns observed. The 'get_readme' function reads a local file without validation, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup activities: defining classifiers, dependencies, and metadata. The 'get_readme' function reads a local file without validation, which is common but not inherently risky. The setup() call configures package installation parameters. No user input, network calls, or untrusted data sources are processed. The code structure and usage are typical for Python package setup scripts, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It performs configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
