  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor point noted is that the `get_readme()` function reads a file without exception handling, but this is common in setup scripts and not suspicious.\n- No external data sources, network activity, code injection, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code matches the described purpose: package configuration for `allure-python-commons`.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The `setup()` function is used as intended, with no risky operations.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code performs no malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, but given the absence of any suspicious activity, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies:**\n\n- Some reports mention that `get_readme()` reads a file without validation, which could be a minor concern, but in the context of a setup script, this is standard practice and not a security issue.\n- No report suggests any reason to increase the risk score beyond 0.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
