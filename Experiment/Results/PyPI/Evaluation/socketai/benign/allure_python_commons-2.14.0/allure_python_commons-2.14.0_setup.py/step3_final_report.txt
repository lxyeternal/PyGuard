  "purpose": "Package configuration for 'allure-python-commons', defining metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file via get_readme() function; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations; no user input processing.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content into long_description; static data used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "The get_readme() function reads a file without exception handling, but this is standard in setup scripts and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a local README file without validation, but this is common practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic is present. The code performs standard package configuration with static data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
