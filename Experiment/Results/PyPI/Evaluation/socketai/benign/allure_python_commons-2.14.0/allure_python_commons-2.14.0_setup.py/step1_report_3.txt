{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'allure-python-commons' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, and gathers package data and dependencies. It does not read untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to files, send data over the network, or execute untrusted commands. The setup function configures package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; data is used solely for package setup and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code uses a straightforward setup procedure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution. It reads a local README file for the description. The setup function uses standard parameters and well-known practices for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity. The code appears benign, intended solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It safely performs package configuration without external data processing or insecure operations.",
