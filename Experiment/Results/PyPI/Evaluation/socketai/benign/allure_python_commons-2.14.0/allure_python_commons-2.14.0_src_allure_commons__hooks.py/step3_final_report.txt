{
  "purpose": "Defines plugin hook specifications for the 'allure' framework using 'pluggy', serving as extension points for plugins.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with method signatures decorated with @hookspec; no external data sources or input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data, external or otherwise.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is declarative interface definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation, data handling, or dynamic code execution; straightforward hook specifications with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and method declarations decorated with @hookspec, serving as plugin extension points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is purely declarative, with no external data handling or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores as zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of plugin hook specifications for the 'allure' framework. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
