  "purpose": "Define hookspecs for Allure testing framework to allow plugins and extensions to customize behavior.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code primarily defines function signatures with no data reading or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network communication, or data processing functions present; no potential for data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code consists solely of decorated function signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. No external calls or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a set of interface definitions via hookspec decorators for a plugin system. All functions are simply declarations with no implementation or data manipulation. No input/output, network, or system commands are present. The code appears to be standard, benign interface definitions for extending functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of hooks for a plugin system related to the Allure testing framework. It contains no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. No anomalies or suspicious activities detected.",
