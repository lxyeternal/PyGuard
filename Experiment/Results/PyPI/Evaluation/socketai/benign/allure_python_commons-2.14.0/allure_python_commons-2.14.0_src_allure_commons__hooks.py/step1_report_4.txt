  "purpose": "This code defines plugin hook specifications for the 'allure' testing/reporting framework, including hooks for user and developer extensions.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines hook specifications and imports from 'pluggy'. No input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data are read.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that handle untrusted data, perform network access, or write to files based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares interface methods with no implementations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pluggy' and defines two classes containing method stubs decorated with @hookspec. These methods serve as plugin interface points for the 'allure' framework. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely declarative, establishing extension points without any logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard definition of plugin hook specifications for the 'allure' framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no data handling, and no security risks. The code appears to be intended solely for defining plugin interfaces, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
