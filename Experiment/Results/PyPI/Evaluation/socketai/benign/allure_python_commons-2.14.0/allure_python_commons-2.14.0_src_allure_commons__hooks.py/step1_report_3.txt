{
  "purpose": "Define hookspecs for Allure testing framework integrations, including user and developer hooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines functions with parameters.",
  "hooks": "The functions are purely declarative; they define expected hooks without performing actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions are placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and method definitions for hooks in a plugin system. All methods are decorated with @hookspec and contain only docstrings and parameter definitions. There are no data manipulations, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is evident. The absence of any input handling, network activity, or file operations suggests this is a benign, declarative setup for plugin hooks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard definition of plugin hooks for the Allure framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a safe and intended part of a larger testing infrastructure.",
