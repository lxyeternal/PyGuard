  "purpose": "Define plugin hooks for Allure reporting framework, allowing external plugins to implement custom behavior for test reporting and fixtures.",
  "sources": "Importing hooks from 'pluggy' library; defining hook specifications with no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs detected.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns found. The code is straightforward hook definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines hook specifications using the 'pluggy' library, with no implementation, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. All functions are purely declarative, serving as extension points for other plugins. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The code appears to be a standard plugin hook setup for the Allure testing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard hook specification for the Allure framework, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as an interface for plugin implementations and does not perform any data processing or external interactions.",
