  "purpose": "Define hookspecs for Allure testing framework plugins to extend or customize behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines functions and decorators for plugin hooks.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; functions are placeholders without data processing logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code consists solely of decorated function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes containing method declarations decorated as hookspecs for the Allure plugin system. The functions are placeholders with docstrings but no implementation or data handling logic. There are no signs of malicious code, external data processing, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears to serve as a structured interface for plugin hooks without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard declaration of plugin hooks for the Allure testing framework. It contains no malicious activity, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is a benign, well-structured interface definition.",
