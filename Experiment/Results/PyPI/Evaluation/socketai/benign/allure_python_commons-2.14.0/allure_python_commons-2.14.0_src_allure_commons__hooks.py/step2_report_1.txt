  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class and method definitions decorated with `@hookspec` from the 'pluggy' library. There are no signs of data processing, external data sources, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely declarative, serving as an interface for plugin hooks in the Allure framework. No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign interface definitions, with no malicious or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n   - `confidence`: 1\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the nature of the code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and the high confidence score is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude that the code is benign with no malicious intent, the risk scores should remain at 0. The code does not perform any external actions, handle untrusted data, or contain any vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. There is no malicious activity, code injection, or backdoor evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and content. They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of hook specifications for the 'pluggy' plugin system used by the Allure testing framework.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code patterns are present.  \n- No external data sources, network activity, or data handling that could introduce security risks.  \n- The purpose is clearly to define extension points, which is a common and benign pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and free of obfuscation. The scores should reflect this, with all risk-related scores at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
