{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and objects from the 'allure_commons' package and re-exports them for use in other modules, serving as a setup or interface module for the testing framework.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'allure_commons' package, importing 'hookimpl', 'plugin_manager', 'fixture', and 'test'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static imports to the definition of __all__, with no dynamic data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and an __all__ list. Use of '# noqa: F401' is typical for suppressing unused import warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static import operations from a well-known testing library, with no dynamic execution, external communication, or data manipulation. It defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. The code is typical for a module setup or re-export file, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The import statements are static, and the use of '# noqa: F401' indicates standard practice for such modules. No vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for re-exporting symbols from the 'allure_commons' package. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
