{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and objects from the 'allure_commons' package and defines an export list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'allure_commons._hooks', 'allure_commons._core', and 'allure_commons._allure' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely import and export declaration code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and objects from a well-known testing and reporting library 'allure_commons'. It then defines a list '__all__' to specify what symbols are exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no functions, data processing, or network activities. The use of '# noqa: F401' indicates intentional suppression of unused import warnings. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that simply manages imports and exports related to the 'allure_commons' package. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
