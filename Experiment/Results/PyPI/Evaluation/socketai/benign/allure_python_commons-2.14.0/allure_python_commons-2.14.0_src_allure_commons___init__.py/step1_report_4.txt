{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports specific components from the allure_commons package for use in other modules or scripts, likely to facilitate plugin or test framework integrations.",
  "sources": "Imports from allure_commons._hooks, allure_commons._core, and allure_commons._allure modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leakage are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely imports and exports references",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code only involves import statements and an __all__ export list.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from the allure_commons package, which is a well-known open-source testing and reporting library. The imports are followed by an __all__ declaration, which specifies the module's public API. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations. All imported modules are standard parts of the allure framework, and no suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The code structure is straightforward and conventional for module re-exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export pattern used to expose selected components from the allure_commons package. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign utility module.",
