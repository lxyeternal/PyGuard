{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and objects from the 'allure_commons' package and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'allure_commons' modules",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'noqa' comments to suppress linter warnings; import of test-related functions and objects without usage within this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static imports from a well-known open-source testing/ reporting library, 'allure_commons'. There is no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external communication. The imports are straightforward and do not involve any secret or sensitive information. The presence of 'noqa' comments indicates suppression of linter warnings but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard module setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and export module setup from the 'allure_commons' package. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are present. It appears to be a legitimate part of a test reporting setup.",
