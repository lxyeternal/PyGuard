  "purpose": "This code imports specific symbols from the allure_commons package modules and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing symbols from allure_commons modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Imports from modules to the current namespace; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static imports and defines __all__ for module exports. All imported items are standard symbols from the allure_commons package, used for test reporting and hooks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a test reporting plugin.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module that imports and exposes certain symbols from the allure_commons package. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
