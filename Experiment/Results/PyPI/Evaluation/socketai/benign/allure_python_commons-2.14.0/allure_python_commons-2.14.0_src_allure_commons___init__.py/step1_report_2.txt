{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and objects from the allure_commons library and defines an export list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'allure_commons' modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sink for untrusted data or actions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions and objects from the 'allure_commons' library and defines an __all__ list for module exports. The imported functions and objects are standard parts of the Allure framework used for test reporting and hooks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No dynamic execution, code injection, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to typical Python module patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that imports and re-exports functions from the 'allure_commons' library. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be part of a test reporting setup, with no security risks.",
