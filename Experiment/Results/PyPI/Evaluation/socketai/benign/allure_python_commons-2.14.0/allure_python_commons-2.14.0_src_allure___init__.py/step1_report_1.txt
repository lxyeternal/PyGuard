{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python module that imports various functions, classes, and constants from the 'allure_commons' library for use in test reporting and management.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'allure_commons._allure' and 'allure_commons.types' modules at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of import statements and an explicit __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions, classes, and constants related to allure reporting, and defines an export list (__all__). There are no dynamic code execution, user inputs, or data manipulations. All imports are from known, trusted library modules. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for an import module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module that organizes imports for test reporting functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply re-exports specific functions and constants for use elsewhere.",
