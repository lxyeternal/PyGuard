{
  "purpose": "The code imports various functions and classes from the 'allure_commons' library for use in test reporting and metadata annotation.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading modules and specific functions/classes from 'allure_commons._allure' and 'allure_commons.types'.",
  "sinks": "Assignments to __all__ for exposing imported functions/classes as module exports.",
  "flows": "No dynamic execution, user input, or untrusted data flows present. The code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export module, gathering functions and constants from a well-known testing library 'allure_commons'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The structure and syntax are standard, with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns. The purpose appears to be to facilitate test reporting features, not to perform any risky actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that simply imports and re-exports components from the 'allure_commons' library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
