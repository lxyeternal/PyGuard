  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific functions, classes, and constants from the 'allure_commons' library, specifically from the '_allure' and 'types' submodules. It then defines an `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported when the module is imported elsewhere. The code contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, external data processing, or network interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is just a static import and export module with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is simple and correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n- **Are the scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Correct. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Correct. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 in all reports.  \n  Appropriate, as the code performs only static imports and exports, with no external data handling or dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Any assumptions or questionable claims?**  \n  No. All reports correctly state that the code is benign and standard for organizing imports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, the code is a benign, standard module for organizing imports related to test reporting with 'allure_commons'. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analyses and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, well-structured import/export module with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm the current scores as accurate.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\nIf you need a more detailed explanation or have additional reports, please let me know.",
