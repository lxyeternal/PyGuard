  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions and classes from the 'allure_commons' library and defines an __all__ list for module exports, facilitating test reporting and annotation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'allure_commons._allure' and 'allure_commons.types' modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that process untrusted data are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present; all imports are from documented library modules",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import statements from the 'allure_commons' testing and reporting library, followed by defining the __all__ list to specify module exports. No data processing, user input, or external network interaction occurs. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export declaration for a testing library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
