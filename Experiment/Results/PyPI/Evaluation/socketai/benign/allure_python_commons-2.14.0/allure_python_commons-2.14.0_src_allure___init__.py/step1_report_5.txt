{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from the 'allure_commons' package for use in test reporting and annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'allure_commons._allure' and 'allure_commons.types' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data processing or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only imports symbols and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The code strictly imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from a known testing library ('allure_commons') and defines an explicit export list (__all__). All imports are static and from trusted modules. There are no data flows, no input handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. It appears to be a straightforward module setup for exposing certain API elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and export module for test reporting annotations from the 'allure_commons' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code segment.",
