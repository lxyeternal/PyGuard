  "purpose": "Utility module providing helper functions for data representation, environment info, traceback formatting, and safe string formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'ALLURE_TESTPLAN_PATH', system data such as hostname, process ID, thread name, current time, Python version and implementation, and data passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified as security-sensitive sinks; no untrusted data flows leading to code execution, data leakage, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flow paths detected; functions process and format data locally without external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Functions appear to serve general utility purposes; no suspicious obfuscation or hidden behaviors. No external network or file modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for data representation, environment tagging, traceback formatting, and safe string formatting. All data sources are system or input parameters; outputs are mainly formatted strings or data structures. No indication of malicious data handling or external communication. The functions are straightforward, with proper error handling and no signs of obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a collection of utility functions for data formatting and environment info gathering, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform external communication, data theft, or sabotage. It is safe and benign.",
