  "purpose": "Utility functions for debugging, data representation, environment info, and safe formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system info, input parameters, exception info, and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No external network or file I/O; data processed locally for debugging/logging.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment info used within functions; no external data transmission or modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions leveraging built-in libraries for data representation, environment info, traceback formatting, and safe string formatting. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The environment variable reading is typical for configuration or testing purposes and does not indicate malicious intent. The malware scores are correctly set to 0, and obfuscation scores are 0, reflecting the code's clarity. The risk scores are low (~0.1), acknowledging minimal potential for data leaks in debugging contexts but not indicating any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, accurately representing its safe nature.",
