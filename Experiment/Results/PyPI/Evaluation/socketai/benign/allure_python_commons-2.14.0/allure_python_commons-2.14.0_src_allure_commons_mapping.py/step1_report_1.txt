{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse and process Allure test report tags into labels and links, with utility functions for handling labels and patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'tag', 'labels' list, 'issue_pattern', and 'link_pattern'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or output operations are present. No untrusted data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed.",
  "flows": "Input tags are processed within 'parse_tag' to produce Label or Link objects; 'labels_set' deduplicates and sorts labels.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Use of regex for parsing appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for parsing Allure report tags into structured labels and links, handling different tag formats and patterns. The regex patterns are used solely for string splitting and detection. The functions for label management, such as 'labels_set', utilize Python data structures to deduplicate and sort labels without executing any external code or performing unsafe operations. The overall structure is straightforward, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for processing test report tags into labels and links, with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code and appears safe for use.",
