{
  "purpose": "The code parses and processes allure tags into labels and links for test reporting and categorization.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily provided through function parameters such as 'tag', 'issue_pattern', and 'link_pattern'. No external data sources are directly accessed within this code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include return statements where Labels and Links are created and returned; however, these are standard data structures without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'tag' strings are processed and split to produce Label or Link objects based on patterns; the code constructs labels/links based on pattern matches and returns them.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard parsing utility with no suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are present. The use of regex and dynamic pattern matching is typical for such parsers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to parse tags into structured Label or Link objects, with regex-based pattern detection. The functions handle specific tag formats, including special handling for severity levels, issue URLs, and custom labels. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage. No unsafe operations like executing untrusted code, network connections, or data leaks are present. The code is well-structured and focused on data parsing without side effects. Overall, the logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious elements detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for parsing allure tags into labels and links, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purely functional for its intended purpose.",
