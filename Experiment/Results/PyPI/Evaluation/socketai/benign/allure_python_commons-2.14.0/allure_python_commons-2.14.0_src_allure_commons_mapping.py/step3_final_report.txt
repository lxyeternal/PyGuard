  "purpose": "The code parses Allure test report tags into structured labels and links for reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "String inputs representing tags, which are split and pattern-matched to generate labels and links.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed locally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input tags are split and matched via regex; resulting labels and links are returned without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; regex usage is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex to detect patterns in tags, then splits and interprets them into label or link objects. No external calls, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The functions operate solely on input strings, producing structured data. The regex patterns are simple and used for string splitting, not for executing code or handling untrusted data in a dangerous way.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing test report tags into labels and links. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
