The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. The warning filtering, while potentially misused, is standard practice and does not constitute a security concern in this context."

The security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential management, which is handled properly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical operational risk for SDK code handling credentials."

The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, primarily reflecting potential misuse rather than inherent vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as zero. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is benign."
