  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured DynamoDB batch writer utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified, primarily reflecting potential misuse rather than inherent vulnerabilities. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as zero. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is benign."
