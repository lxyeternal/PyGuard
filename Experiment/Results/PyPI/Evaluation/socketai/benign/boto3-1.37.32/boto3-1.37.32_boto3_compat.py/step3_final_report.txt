  "purpose": "Utility functions for file operations, warnings filtering, and deprecation notices, designed to handle platform-specific behaviors and inform users about deprecations.",
  "sources": "os.remove, os.rename, warnings.filterwarnings, warnings.warn, sys.platform, sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "os.remove, os.rename, warnings.warn, warnings.filterwarnings",
  "flows": "File operations and warning filters are invoked based on system platform and version info, with no external data flow or untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, standard library usage",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform-specific file renaming with error handling, filters deprecation warnings, issues deprecation notices based on Python version, and manages warnings for runtime. All functions follow standard practices, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The warning filtering could be misused to suppress important warnings, but in this context, it is a common and legitimate pattern. No external data sources or network activity are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves maintenance and compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling filesystem operations and warnings, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. The warning filtering, while potentially misused, is standard practice and does not constitute a security concern in this context.",
