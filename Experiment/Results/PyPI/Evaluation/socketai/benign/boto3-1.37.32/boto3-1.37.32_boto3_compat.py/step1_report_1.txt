  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for file operations, warnings management, and deprecation notices related to AWS SDK (boto3) compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (sys.platform, sys.version_info), environment variables, and imports of standard libraries and boto3 exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to os.remove, os.rename, warnings.warn, and warnings.filterwarnings that could be used to execute or trigger warnings based on runtime conditions.",
  "flows": "System info and environment data influence warnings and file operations. Warning functions are called based on version checks, affecting runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code mainly handles warnings and file operations with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement safe file renaming with platform-specific handling, warning suppression for deprecation notices, and version-based deprecation alerts. It uses standard libraries and well-documented patterns. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. It manages warnings responsibly and includes no network or data-exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility script for handling warnings and file operations with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It primarily aims to ensure compatibility and inform users about deprecation policies. No security risks or malware are detected.",
