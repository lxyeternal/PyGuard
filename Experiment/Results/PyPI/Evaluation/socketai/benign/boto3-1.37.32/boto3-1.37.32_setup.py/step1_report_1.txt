{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the boto3 AWS SDK for Python.",
  "sources": "Reads the __init__.py file to extract version; reads README.rst for long description; no external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads static files for metadata and invokes setup functions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. The script performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup file using setuptools. It imports necessary modules, reads package metadata from files, and invokes setup() with static data. The get_version() function reads a version string from a local file, which is standard practice. All dependencies are version-restricted and are from trusted sources. No external or untrusted inputs are used, and no dynamic or insecure code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a well-known package (boto3) with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected tasks for package configuration without any suspicious behavior.",
