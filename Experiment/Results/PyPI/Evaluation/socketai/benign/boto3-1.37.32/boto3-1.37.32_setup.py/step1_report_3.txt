  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the boto3 Python SDK for AWS",
  "sources": "Reading '__init__.py' for version info, reading README.rst for description, reading package data files",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or insecure data handling observed",
  "flows": "Reading version from '__init__.py' -> setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info and package data. It imports only standard libraries and setuptools, with no network connections or code execution based on untrusted input. The use of regular expressions and file I/O appears benign. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity observed. The code adheres to typical Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
