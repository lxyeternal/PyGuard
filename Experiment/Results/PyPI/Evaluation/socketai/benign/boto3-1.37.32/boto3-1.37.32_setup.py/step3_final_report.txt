  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'boto3/__init__.py' and long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "Static data read from local files; no external data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: importing modules, reading static files, regex extraction of version, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. All operations are static, trusted, and standard for Python packaging. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
