  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in Boto3 and botocore interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads exception class definitions, string formatting parameters, and imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows; primarily class definitions and exception raising structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes extending standard Python and botocore exceptions. It includes string formatting for error messages, but no dynamic code execution, untrusted input processing, or external communications. No obfuscated code, malware, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structured error handling framework for Boto3 interactions. It appears to be legitimate and safe, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
