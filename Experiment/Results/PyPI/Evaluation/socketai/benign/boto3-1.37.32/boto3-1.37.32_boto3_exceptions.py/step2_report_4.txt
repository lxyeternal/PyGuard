  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in an AWS SDK wrapper or utility, extending from Python's `Exception` and `botocore.exceptions` classes.\n   - It includes constructors that format error messages with parameters, but no dynamic or untrusted data is processed beyond string formatting.\n   - The code is straightforward, primarily for categorizing and managing errors.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network interactions.\n   - Exception messages are constructed with parameters, but these are controlled inputs (likely internal error info), not untrusted user data.\n   - The import statements are standard and relevant.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Errors**:\n   - The only minor note is the typo in `DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError`, which is assigned to the correctly spelled `DynamoDBOperationNotSupportedError`. This is a backward compatibility alias, not a security concern.\n   - The class `NoVersionFound` is unused, but this does not impact security.\n   - The use of `Exception.__init__` instead of `super().__init__` in some constructors is acceptable but slightly inconsistent; it does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious behavior or code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks, vulnerabilities, or data leaks.\n   - The reports uniformly assign high confidence that the code is benign and standard.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly assume this is a standard exception class hierarchy.\n   - No assumptions about untrusted data or external inputs are problematic because none are processed here.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for error handling.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues.\n   - The only noteworthy point is the typo for backward compatibility, which does not affect security.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Based on the detailed analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware**: 0\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0\n  - **Risk**: 0\n\nThese align with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely to categorize and format error messages within an SDK or application context.",
