{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to AWS boto3 and botocore operations.",
  "sources": "Import of botocore.exceptions; class definitions that may instantiate or handle error objects.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any code that catches these exceptions and logs or processes error messages, but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Error conditions trigger exception creation, which could propagate if caught or logged, but no untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Exception messages are standard and informative.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions with custom messages. It imports standard botocore exceptions and extends them. There are no input/output data flows, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation, no code injection, or malicious activity detected. The comments indicate maintenance and backward compatibility concerns, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of custom exceptions related to AWS SDK error handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured error handling code without security risks.",
