{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for use in the Boto3 AWS SDK for Python, primarily for error handling related to AWS service interactions.",
  "sources": "The code imports exception classes from botocore.exceptions and defines various custom exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code creates exception objects and raises or initializes them in error conditions, but does not process or handle untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward class definitions for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of custom exception class definitions related to AWS SDK errors, inheriting from standard Exception and botocore exception classes. It includes typical constructor methods for formatting error messages. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be standard, well-structured error class definitions intended for use within a larger SDK or application. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of custom exception classes for error handling in the Boto3 SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
