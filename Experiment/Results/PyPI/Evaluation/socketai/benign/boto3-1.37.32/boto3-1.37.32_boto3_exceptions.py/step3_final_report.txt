{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling in AWS SDK (boto3/botocore) contexts, facilitating structured error management and messaging.",
  "sources": "Exception constructors formatting messages with parameters; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "Formatted error messages stored in exception instances; no data leaks or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with parameters leading to formatted messages; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks beyond internal string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in alias 'DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError' (likely backward compatibility), no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, importing from botocore.exceptions. It formats messages with parameters but does not process untrusted data or perform any malicious actions. No obfuscation, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes serve purely structural purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. The only minor issue is a typo in an alias name, which does not affect security or functionality. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and intended solely for error categorization and messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its purpose. No security concerns are associated with this code.",
