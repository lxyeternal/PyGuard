  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Boto3-related AWS SDK operations.",
  "sources": "Import of botocore.exceptions; class initializations and exception raising with formatted messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations with formatted messages that include input parameters; potential logging or error display.",
  "flows": "Input parameters passed to exception constructors -> formatted error messages -> raised exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Exception handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions and botocore exceptions. It uses formatted strings to generate error messages based on input parameters, but does not process or include any untrusted data sources such as network input, environment variables, or user input directly. The code structure is typical for error handling in SDKs and contains no obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden functionalities. The commented notes and code comments are consistent and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears purely functional, focusing on exception hierarchy management.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for AWS SDK error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is well-structured and appears safe for inclusion in a package. No malware or malicious activity detected.",
