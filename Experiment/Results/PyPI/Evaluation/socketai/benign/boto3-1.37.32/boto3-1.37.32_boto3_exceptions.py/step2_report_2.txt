  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling.\n- It imports botocore.exceptions and defines subclasses with formatted error messages.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The code appears standard, well-structured, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues and Code Behavior:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n- **Data flows:** Exception message formatting involves parameters, but no untrusted data sources are processed or exposed.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The exception classes inherit from Python's `Exception` and `botocore.exceptions.*`.\n- Constructors format messages with parameters, which is standard.\n- No external data, network input, or environment variables are directly involved.\n- The code is purely structural, defining error classes.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Report Scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0          | 0            | 0            | Correct; no malicious or obfuscated code, no security risk. |\n| 2       | 0          | 0            | 0            | Correct; straightforward class definitions, no malicious intent. |\n| 3       | 0          | 0            | 0            | Correct; standard exception hierarchy, no security issues. |\n| 4       | 0          | 0            | 0            | Correct; no malicious behavior, no obfuscation. |\n| 5       | 0          | 0            | 0            | Correct; purely error class definitions, safe. |\n\nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or security risks.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is the backward compatibility class alias `DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError`, which appears to be a typo but does not impact security or functionality.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling. No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
