  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   The code is a set of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, importing from botocore.exceptions and extending Exception. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors. The class constructors only format messages with parameters, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   - The code is straightforward and well-structured.  \n   - There are no evident logical errors or security flaws.  \n   - The only minor note is the typo in `DynanmoDBOperationNotSupportedError`, which is an alias for `DynamoDBOperationNotSupportedError`. This appears intentional for backward compatibility, not an error.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   No issue warrants a high risk score. The code is purely for error handling, with no untrusted data processing, network activity, or code execution. Therefore, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and the analysis is consistent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling. It does not process untrusted data, does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only minor issue is a typo in an alias name, which is likely for backward compatibility and not malicious.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided reports' assessments.** They correctly identify the code as safe, with no security risks or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for error handling.  \n- No changes to scores are necessary.  \n- The code is safe and should be considered secure.",
