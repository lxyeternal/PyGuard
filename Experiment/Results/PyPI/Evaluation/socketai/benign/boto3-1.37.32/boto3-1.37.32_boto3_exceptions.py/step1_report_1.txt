{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a boto3-based AWS SDK wrapper or utility.",
  "sources": "Import of botocore.exceptions and various class initializations, especially in exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the exception constructors could process or display untrusted input if misused, but current code only formats strings with parameters.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with formatted messages, but no untrusted data flows from source to sink that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; the code appears to be standard error class definitions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of exception classes for AWS resource errors, extending from Python's Exception class and integrating botocore exceptions. Exception messages are constructed with formatted strings that include parameters, but there is no dynamic or untrusted data processing that could lead to injection or leaks. The import statements and class structures are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is purely structural, providing a way to handle errors with descriptive messages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling. It does not contain malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It functions solely to categorize and format error messages. Overall, it is safe with no security concerns.",
