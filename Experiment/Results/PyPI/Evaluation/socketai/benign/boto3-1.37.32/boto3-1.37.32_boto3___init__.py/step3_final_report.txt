  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing boto3 AWS SDK sessions and logging configurations.",
  "sources": "Session creation via boto3.session.Session, logging setup via logging module, environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, session method calls, potential exposure of sensitive data via logs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to session and logger setup functions, logging outputs, session method invocations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard AWS SDK session management and logging utilities with appropriate warnings about sensitive data exposure. No external network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are straightforward, relying on well-established Python and boto3 practices. The logging configuration includes a NullHandler to suppress unwanted logs, and warnings about data leakage are explicitly documented. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed, and the code appears benign and intended for legitimate use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for boto3 session and logging management, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain threats. The minimal risk score reflects the potential for sensitive data exposure via logs, which is a common concern in debugging scenarios but not an active vulnerability.",
