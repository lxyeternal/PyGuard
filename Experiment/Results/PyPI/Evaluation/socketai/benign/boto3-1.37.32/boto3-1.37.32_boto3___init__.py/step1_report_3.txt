  "purpose": "This code provides setup and utility functions for the boto3 AWS SDK, including session management and logging configuration.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from function parameters (kwargs) for setup_default_session, set_stream_logger, and client/resource creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the creation of boto3 sessions and clients, logging outputs, and the use of global variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided parameters into session and client/resource constructors, and from function calls to logging handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors observed. The code adheres to standard boto3 usage patterns and logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup module for boto3, handling session initialization and logging. It uses standard Python practices, includes no external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. Logging is configured to avoid leaks, and the global session management is conventional. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup utility for AWS boto3 SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical initialization tasks safely.",
