  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to set up and manage boto3 AWS service sessions and logging configuration.",
  "sources": "User or system calls to setup_default_session, set_stream_logger, client, resource; environment variables affecting boto3 behavior (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data output or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Function calls to setup_default_session or set_stream_logger are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. Use of deprecated warnings suggests legacy support but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a default boto3 session and configures logging for debugging purposes. It includes functions for session setup and logging with warnings about sensitive data exposure when logging wire data. The NullHandler class disables logging output, aligning with typical library behavior. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration observed. The code primarily manages AWS SDK sessions and logging, which are standard functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for boto3 session and logging management. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is consistent with typical SDK helper code and does not exhibit any supply chain threats.",
