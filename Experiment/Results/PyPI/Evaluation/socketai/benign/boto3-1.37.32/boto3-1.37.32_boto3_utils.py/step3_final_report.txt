  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for dynamic module import, lazy loading of waiter models, and attribute injection within an SDK context.",
  "sources": "import_module function, lazy_call function, ServiceContext class, LazyLoadedWaiterModel class, inject_attribute function",
  "sinks": "getattr invocation in lazy_call, dynamic import via __import__ in import_module, attribute injection in inject_attribute",
  "flows": "import_module called with module name -> gettattr retrieves function -> lazy_call executes function with provided kwargs -> inject_attribute modifies class attributes",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and getattr without input validation, potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no actual malicious code or backdoors present",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard SDK patterns for dynamic module loading, lazy resource management, and attribute injection. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic invocation patterns are typical but could pose risks if used with untrusted inputs; however, in this context, parameters are controlled. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and lacks malicious intent. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal inherent risk due to dynamic features, which is acceptable given the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign SDK utility code with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic patterns are standard and controlled, resulting in low malware and obfuscation scores and a low security risk. Overall, the code is safe for use in its intended environment.",
