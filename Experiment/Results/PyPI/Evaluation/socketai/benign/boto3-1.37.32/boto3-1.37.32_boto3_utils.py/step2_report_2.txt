  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward class and function definitions with dynamic import and attribute injection. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound; dynamic import and getattr are standard patterns here.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is low (0.2). These seem appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores > 0.5?** None needed; all scores are low.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report correctly notes that dynamic import and getattr could be risky if untrusted input is used, but in this context, the code is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Utility functions for dynamic import and lazy loading, standard in SDKs.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is low (0.2). Appropriate.\n- **Justification for higher scores?** Not necessary.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report appropriately notes the typical use of dynamic import and getattr.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard utility code with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to previous, utility functions for dynamic import and lazy loading.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The analysis is accurate.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk low (0.2). Justified.\n- **Potential assumptions?** Correctly identified that dynamic import and getattr are common but should be used carefully.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign utility code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Focused on dynamic import, attribute injection, and lazy loading.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning correctly notes that untrusted inputs could pose risks but does not find any actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk low (0.2). Appropriate.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The analysis is cautious and accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard utility code, safe in this context.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar utility functions for dynamic import, lazy loading, and attribute injection.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is correct.\n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Potential assumptions?** No problematic assumptions.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe utility module.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm the code is present and correctly identified.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0 across reports, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slightly higher (0.2) in some reports, justified by the use of dynamic import and getattr, which could be risky if used with untrusted input. However, in this context, the inputs are controlled, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Overall:** The code is standard utility code for SDKs, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, mainly due to the use of dynamic import and getattr, which can be risky if misused, but in this context, appears safe.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign utility module, typical for SDK infrastructure, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
