  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward class and function definitions with dynamic import and getattr usage, typical in SDKs.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 seem reasonable given the dynamic import and getattr, but since these are common patterns in SDKs, a risk score of 0.2 might be slightly high but acceptable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The pattern is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Utility functions and classes for dynamic import and lazy loading are standard.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 are reasonable. The dynamic import and getattr are typical but should be used carefully; here, parameters are controlled, so no immediate concern.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Similar utility functions and classes.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores?** Consistent with previous reports.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Focuses on dynamic import and attribute injection, which are standard patterns.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores?** Risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, given the functions are designed for flexibility but should be used with trusted inputs.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same utility functions and classes.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0 are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard utility functions/classes for dynamic module import, lazy loading, and attribute injection within an SDK context.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Risks:** The dynamic import and getattr patterns can be risky if used with untrusted inputs, but in this context, parameters are controlled, and no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (a small potential risk due to dynamic code execution patterns, but acceptable given context)  \n\n**Note:** The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the utility nature of the code and the absence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard SDK utility code with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the slight risk score accounts for the inherent dangers of dynamic import and getattr patterns if misused in untrusted contexts.",
