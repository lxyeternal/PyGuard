{
  "purpose": "This code implements an AWS session management class using boto3 and botocore, handling credentials, configurations, resource loading, and client/resource creation.",
  "sources": "Credentials and configuration parameters passed to the constructor and methods, environment variables, and internal session state.",
  "sinks": "Credential parameters flow into boto3/botocore SDK calls for client and resource creation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (credentials, region, profile) flow into session setup, credential setting, and SDK client/resource instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious routines detected. Credential validation appears standard. No suspicious network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured AWS SDK session handler. It manages credentials securely, performs standard resource and client creation, and registers typical SDK customizations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The credential handling includes validation and error checks, following best practices. The resource loading and event registration are SDK features, not malicious routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard AWS SDK session management code with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious routines. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential management, which is handled properly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical operational risk for SDK code handling credentials.",
