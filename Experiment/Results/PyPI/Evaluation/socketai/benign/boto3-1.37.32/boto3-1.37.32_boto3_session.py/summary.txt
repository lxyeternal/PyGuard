  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard AWS SDK session management code with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious routines. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to credential management, which is handled properly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical operational risk for SDK code handling credentials."
