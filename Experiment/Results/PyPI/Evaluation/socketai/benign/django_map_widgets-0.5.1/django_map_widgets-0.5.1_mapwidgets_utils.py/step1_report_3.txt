  "purpose": "Provide an asynchronous JavaScript inclusion class and a utility to minify assets based on Django settings.",
  "sources": "Django settings (VERSION, mw_settings.MINIFED), input parameter 'js', 'asset' string",
  "sinks": "format_html calls that output script tags, string formatting in minify_if_not_debug",
  "flows": "Input 'js' or 'asset' flows through format_html or string formatting to generate HTML output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class AsyncJS that conditionally renders script tags with async attribute, based on Django version. It uses safe HTML rendering functions and dynamic URL handling. The minify_if_not_debug function appends '.min' based on Django settings, which is typical for asset management. No external data is read except from configuration variables. No network connections, data leaks, or code injections are evident. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for rendering async script tags and managing asset minification based on settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
