{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for embedding asynchronous JavaScript tags in HTML templates and a utility function for minifying assets based on Django settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameter 'js' during class instantiation, Django settings, and the 'asset' parameter in the minify_if_not_debug function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted HTML script tags via format_html, which could potentially include untrusted URLs if 'js' is supplied from an external source.",
  "flows": "Untrusted 'js' input can flow through __str__ or __html__ methods to form HTML script tags, which are rendered into templates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code performs standard template rendering logic.",
  "analysis": "The code safely formats script tags with 'async' attribute, and includes conditional logic based on Django version. The 'js' input is checked for URL schemes or absolute path indicators before being used in HTML, reducing injection risk. The minify_if_not_debug function conditionally appends '.min' to asset names based on settings, which appears straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected. The code appears to be a standard utility for template rendering with safe handling of URLs and static assets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard template utility for including JavaScript files asynchronously, with proper URL handling. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It appears safe and compliant with typical web application practices.",
