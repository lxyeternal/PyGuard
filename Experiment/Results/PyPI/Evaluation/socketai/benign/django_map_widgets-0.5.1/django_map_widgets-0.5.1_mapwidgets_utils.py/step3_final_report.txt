  "purpose": "Provides a class for asynchronously including JavaScript assets with version-dependent HTML rendering, and a utility for minifying assets based on debug settings.",
  "sources": "The 'js' parameter in AsyncJS, and the 'asset' parameter in minify_if_not_debug, which are used as inputs for HTML rendering and filename modification respectively.",
  "sinks": "The 'js' string in format_html where it is embedded into HTML; potential for injection if 'js' is untrusted and not sanitized.",
  "flows": "The 'js' input flows from instantiation of AsyncJS into the __str__ or __html__ methods, where it is embedded into HTML via format_html, which escapes inputs unless 'js' is a malicious object.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or malicious code; potential concern if 'js' or 'asset' are untrusted, as they are used directly in HTML output without explicit validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using Django utilities to generate safe HTML tags for including JavaScript assets. The 'js' parameter is checked for URL schemes but not sanitized beyond that, relying on Django's format_html to escape strings. If 'js' is controlled by an attacker, injection could occur; however, Django's escaping mitigates this risk unless 'js' is a malicious object with overridden __str__ or __html__ methods. The minify_if_not_debug function appends '.min' based on settings, which is standard. Overall, the code is safe assuming trusted inputs, but untrusted 'js' could pose a risk. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the risk score should be slightly increased (around 0.2-0.3) if inputs are untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and well-structured, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the handling of 'js' if it originates from untrusted sources, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities. The current scoring appropriately reflects the low likelihood of malicious intent but should acknowledge the potential risk if inputs are untrusted.",
