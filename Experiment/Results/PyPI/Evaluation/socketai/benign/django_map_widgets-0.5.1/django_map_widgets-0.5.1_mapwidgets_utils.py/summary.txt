  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and well-structured, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the handling of 'js' if it originates from untrusted sources, which could lead to injection vulnerabilities. The current scoring appropriately reflects the low likelihood of malicious intent but should acknowledge the potential risk if inputs are untrusted."
