  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages async script tags and asset minification, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, using Django's `format_html`, static URL handling, and settings for minification. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95 seems high given the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.  \n- The use of `format_html` and static URLs is safe, assuming `js` is controlled internally or sanitized elsewhere.  \n- The high risk score (0.95) is unjustified; it should be near zero.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Reduce `securityRisk` to 0, `malware` to 0, and `risk` to 0.1 or less, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility code, safe HTML generation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Uses Django version checks, safe HTML functions, and configuration for minification. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 seems appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues detected.  \n- Slightly conservative risk score is justified given the safe code.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores as is, perhaps risk at 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard utility code.\n- **Findings:** Uses safe HTML, conditional logic for Django version, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malware.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Risk score could be 0, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar code, safe HTML output, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Uses URL handling, safe rendering, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly cautious but justified. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep as is; risk score acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Potential concern about untrusted `js` input being used directly in HTML output.\n- **Findings:** The code checks if `js` starts with certain URL schemes or `/`, but does not sanitize or validate `js`. If `js` is user-controlled, injection is possible.\n- **Analysis:**  \n  - The lack of sanitization or validation of `js` input could lead to injection if supplied by an attacker.  \n  - The code relies on the assumption that `js` is safe or controlled, but this is not enforced.\n\n**Implications:**  \n- This is a potential security concern if `js` is user-controlled.  \n- The risk is not necessarily malware, but the possibility of injection or XSS if misused.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malware present)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: Should be increased from 0.2 to around 0.4 or 0.5, considering the injection risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Adjustments:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    | No malicious behavior, high risk score unjustified |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    | Safe code, appropriate score |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0      | Safe, straightforward |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.1    | Slight caution, acceptable |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.4-0.5| Potential injection if `js` is untrusted; warrants higher risk |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Approximately 0.2-0.3 overall, considering the injection potential in report 5.  \n  - For safety, I would assign **0.4** to reflect the potential risk if `js` is untrusted.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is generally safe, well-structured, and standard for Django applications. The main concern is input validation for `js` in the `AsyncJS` class, which if untrusted, could lead to injection vulnerabilities. The current malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, but the overall risk should be slightly increased due to this potential.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.4 (to account for potential injection if `js` is user-controlled)",
