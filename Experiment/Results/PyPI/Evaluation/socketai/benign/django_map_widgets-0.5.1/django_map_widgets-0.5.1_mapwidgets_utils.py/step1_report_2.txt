{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for asynchronously loading JavaScript files in Django templates and includes a utility function for minifying assets based on settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads Django version info, static asset paths via 'static', and the 'mw_settings.MINIFED' setting for minification.",
  "sinks": "The code generates HTML script tags using 'format_html', which outputs safe HTML; no untrusted data is directly written to a sink that could cause injection.",
  "flows": "Input from 'js' parameter flows into HTML generation, with conditional logic to determine whether to use static paths or external URLs. The minify function uses 'asset' and 'mw_settings.MINIFED' to produce a modified string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code relies on standard Django practices and settings. No obfuscation or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Django version checks to define methods appropriately, safely generates HTML for script tags, and conditionally minifies assets based on settings. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or malicious operations. The use of 'format_html' ensures safe HTML output. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django utility module for asset inclusion and minification, with no malicious behavior detected. It follows best practices for safe HTML generation and settings usage.",
