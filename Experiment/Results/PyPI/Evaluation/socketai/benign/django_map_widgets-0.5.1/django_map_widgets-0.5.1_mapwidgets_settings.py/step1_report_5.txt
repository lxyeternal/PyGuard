{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration and utility classes/functions for map widget settings in a Django project, supporting multiple map providers and dynamic reloading of settings.",
  "sources": "django_settings.TIME_ZONE, django_settings.DEBUG, django_settings.MAP_WIDGETS, external files referenced in media/js/css/js arrays, environment variables for settings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; the code mainly processes configuration data without executing external commands or untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from django settings and DEFAULT_SETTINGS into MapWidgetSettings instances; reload_widget_settings updates the global settings upon signal triggers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors detected; code appears standard for configuration handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default map widget configurations and a DotDict class for flexible attribute access. It merges user-defined settings with defaults, allowing dynamic updates via Django signals. No external input or untrusted data processing is evident. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present; the logic is straightforward and pertains solely to configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management module for a Django application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles configuration data securely and dynamically updates settings upon signal events. Overall, it is safe with low malware likelihood.",
