{
  "purpose": "This code manages configuration settings for map widgets in a Django application, including default settings and dynamic reloading of settings on change.",
  "sources": "Reading from django_settings (django_settings.TIME_ZONE, django_settings.DEBUG, django_settings.MAP_WIDGETS), input parameters to MapWidgetSettings and reload_widget_settings",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious if external input modifies 'MAP_WIDGETS' settings and triggers insecure behavior, but the code only updates internal configuration without executing untrusted code or executing system commands.",
  "flows": "django_settings (source) influences get_default_center_coordinates; app_settings input influences MapWidgetSettings, which merges into mw_settings; setting_changed signal triggers reload_widget_settings to update mw_settings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution; no network calls or data leaks; no obfuscated code or suspicious variable names; straightforward configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default map widget settings for various map providers and merges them with user-provided settings, updating dynamically when Django settings change. It reads configuration values from django_settings, merges dictionaries safely without executing external code, and uses signal connection to update internal state. No code injection, network calls, or malicious logic are present. It primarily manages configuration data and responds to settings changes securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration management module for map widgets in a Django project. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only potential concern could be if external code improperly modifies 'MAP_WIDGETS' settings, but this is typical in configuration management and not inherently malicious.",
