  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages map widget configuration, with no malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code is straightforward configuration management with no signs of malicious behavior. The high confidence and zero malware score are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe configuration management, no malicious logic, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe risk score of 0.2 suggests some concern about external modifications to 'MAP_WIDGETS' settings, but the code itself does not execute untrusted code or perform risky operations. The reasoning is sound; the low risk score is justified. Malware=0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates safe handling of configuration, no malicious code, and proper merging of settings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is standard configuration logic. The low risk score is justified, and no malware signals are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on safe merging and dynamic updates.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion, standard configuration handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the others; low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No.  \n- **Obfuscation?** No signs of obfuscation.  \n- **Secrets or secrets management?** API keys are placeholders or retrieved from Django settings, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** The only concern is that external code could modify 'MAP_WIDGETS' settings, but this is typical in Django configuration and not malicious.  \n- **Malware signals?** None. The code does not perform network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Suggested Adjustments:\n\n- The risk scores for reports 2 and 5 are slightly above zero (0.2 and 0.1). Given the code's nature, these should be **closer to 0**, unless there's an external context (not provided) that makes configuration modification risky.\n\n- The malware scores are correctly zero across all reports.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — confirmed safe.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be **0** or very close to it, as the code is standard configuration logic with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Overall:** The code is a well-structured, standard configuration management module with no malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are accurate, with a slight adjustment of risk scores to zero for a more conservative and accurate assessment.",
