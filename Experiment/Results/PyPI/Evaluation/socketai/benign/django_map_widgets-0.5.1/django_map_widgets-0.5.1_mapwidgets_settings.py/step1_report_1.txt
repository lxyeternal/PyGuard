{
  "purpose": "This code manages configuration settings for map widgets in a Django application, including default values, dynamic reloading on settings change, and a dictionary class supporting dot notation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from django_settings (e.g., django_settings.TIME_ZONE, django_settings.DEBUG, django_settings.MAP_WIDGETS), and from the get_default_center_coordinates() function which uses TIMEZONE_COORDINATES.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from settings to configure map widget parameters, including API keys, tokens, style IDs, and map options.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from django_settings into DEFAULT_SETTINGS and into MapWidgetSettings, which merges defaults with app settings; also, settings changes trigger reloading of configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; all API keys and tokens are set to None or placeholders; no suspicious code behaviors or obfuscated code detected. No network calls, no data exfiltration, no backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default map widget settings for multiple map providers, handles dynamic reloading upon settings change, and offers a dictionary class with dot notation access. It retrieves the Django TIME_ZONE setting and uses it to set default map centers, which is standard practice. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious logic or secret data handling. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code relies solely on standard Django and Python features, and all sensitive data points are placeholders or externally configured. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate configuration management module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration utility for map widgets in a Django app. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Its operations are standard for managing app settings, with no suspicious or malicious signals detected.",
