{
  "purpose": "This code manages configuration settings for various map widget providers in a Django application, allowing dynamic updates via signals and providing attribute-style access through DotDict.",
  "sources": "Reads from django_settings (e.g., TIME_ZONE, DEBUG, MAP_WIDGETS) and internal functions like get_default_center_coordinates.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only handles configuration data and updates internal state upon settings change.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from django_settings into DEFAULT_SETTINGS, then merged into MapWidgetSettings, which can be dynamically reloaded via signals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or code injection. The only external influence is configuration modification, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration management module for map widgets, with dynamic reloading support. It uses safe practices, no secrets are hardcoded, and no malicious behaviors are present. The merging logic and signal handling are typical patterns. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe. It manages configuration data without executing untrusted code or performing malicious actions. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
