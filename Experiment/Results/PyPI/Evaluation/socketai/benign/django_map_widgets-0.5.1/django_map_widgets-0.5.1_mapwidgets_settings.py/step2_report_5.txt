  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes configuration management for map widgets, sourcing data from `django_settings` and `get_default_center_coordinates()`.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no network activity, no code injection. Uses standard Django and Python features.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate configuration code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n*This aligns well with the code review.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dynamic reloading via signals.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No code injection, network calls, or malicious logic. Potential concern if external code modifies `MAP_WIDGETS`, but this is typical in configuration management.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard configuration management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n*The risk score is slightly above zero, justified by the possibility of external modification, but overall low.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on configuration and dynamic updates.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No secrets, no unsafe operations, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe configuration code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n*Appropriate, reflecting minimal risk.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar configuration management, with dynamic reloading.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious behaviors, safe practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, secure configuration code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n*Consistent with the code's nature.*\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, safe practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard configuration handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration detected. The code is purely configuration management with no dynamic code execution.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) reflect the potential for external modification of settings (via `MAP_WIDGETS`), but this is a common pattern in Django apps and not inherently malicious.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to external configuration possibility, but overall very low.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a well-structured configuration utility for map widgets, with no malicious logic, secrets, or obfuscation. The minimal risk score accounts for external configuration changes but does not indicate any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' conclusions and aligns with the code's purpose and behavior.",
