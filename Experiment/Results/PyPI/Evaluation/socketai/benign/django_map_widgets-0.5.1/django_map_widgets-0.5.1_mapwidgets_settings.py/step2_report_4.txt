  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions are justified, if the scores are appropriate, and if any inconsistencies or overlooked issues exist.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages map widget configurations, no malicious code, secrets, or obfuscated code. No network activity or backdoors. Functions as intended.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. No issues detected. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safe handling, no code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior. Potential concern if external code modifies 'MAP_WIDGETS' but this is standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but the report justifies it as a cautious estimate given external modifications.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity is evident. The small security risk score accounts for potential misconfiguration but isn't indicative of actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, confirms safe configuration management, no dangerous operations, no code injection, no secrets. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — acceptable, given the configuration context.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are consistent with the code. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates safe handling, no secrets, no malicious code, standard merging and signal handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected. The scoring and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms safe configuration management, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code review.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward configuration management.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** Zero, no obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), justified as cautious but not indicating actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** I agree with all reports' zero scores.\n- **Obfuscated:** Confirmed as zero.\n- **Risk scores:** Should remain low (around 0.0–0.1), as no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0–0.1 — minimal, due to external configuration possibility, but not a concern here.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code appears to be a well-structured, safe configuration module for map widgets in Django, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
