  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a version tuple and constructs a version string.\n   - It imports several widget classes from a local `.widgets` module.\n   - It defines `__all__` to specify what is exported.\n   - The code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic behavior, input/output handling, or external data processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - No network calls, dynamic code execution, or data sinks.\n   - The imports are from a local module, indicating standard package setup.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as a standard module setup for map widget classes.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security concerns are identified.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n   - Malware scores are 0 in all reports, aligning with the benign analysis.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasonableness:**\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - No reason to adjust these scores; they accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is purely static and standard, there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n   - The only hypothetical concern could be if the imported widget classes were malicious, but the reports and code do not suggest this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical module for defining version info and importing widget classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed as the code appears safe and standard.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0** (benign)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code review.",
