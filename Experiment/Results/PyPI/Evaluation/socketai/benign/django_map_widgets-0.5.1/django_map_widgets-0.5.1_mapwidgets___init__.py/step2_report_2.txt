  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a version tuple and constructs a version string.\n   - It imports several widget classes from a local `.widgets` module.\n   - It specifies an `__all__` list to define what is exported from the module.\n   \n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n   - The imports are straightforward, importing classes from a local module.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The purpose appears to be setting up a module for mapping widgets, which is common in mapping or GIS-related Python packages.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They assign a confidence level of 1, with malware, obfuscated code, and security risks all scored at 0.\n   - The reasoning is sound: the code is simple, static, and typical for a Python package module.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious behavior is evident.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate. No security risks are apparent.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that the imported classes are safe, which is reasonable given the context.\n   - There is no indication of hidden or malicious code within the imported classes or the `.widgets` module, but that would require further inspection of the `.widgets` module itself.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The overall security posture of this code is safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe module setup for importing and exporting mapping widget classes.",
