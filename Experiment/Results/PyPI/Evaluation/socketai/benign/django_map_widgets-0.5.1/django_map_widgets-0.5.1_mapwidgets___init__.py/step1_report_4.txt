{
  "purpose": "Define version information and import specific widget classes related to map points for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only references local variables and imports modules from the same package.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily defining constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple and joins it into a string, then imports a list of widget classes from a relative module. It then defines __all__ for export. There are no input or output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be a straightforward module setup for a mapping widget library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module to expose specific widgets and version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
