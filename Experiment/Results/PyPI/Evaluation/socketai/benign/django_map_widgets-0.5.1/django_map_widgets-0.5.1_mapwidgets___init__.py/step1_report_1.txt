{
  "purpose": "Defines version information and imports specific widget classes related to map point fields for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own version tuple, and imports widget classes from a local module (.widgets).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or write data to external sources.",
  "flows": "The version string is constructed from a constant; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The import statements are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a version identifier and imports several widget classes related to map point fields, likely for a mapping interface in a larger application. All elements are static and standard; no external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code structure appears typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for importing widget classes and defining version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe.",
