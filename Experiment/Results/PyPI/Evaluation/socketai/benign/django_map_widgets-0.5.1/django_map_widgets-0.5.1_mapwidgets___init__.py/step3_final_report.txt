{
  "purpose": "This code defines a version identifier and imports several widget classes related to mapping functionalities, setting up the module's namespace and exports.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of VERSION tuple, import statements from local .widgets module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external data handling",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or dynamic execution present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with clear structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, defining version info and importing classes for export. It contains no dynamic behavior, no input/output, no network activity, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module setup for a mapping widget library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
