  "purpose": "Define package version and import specific widget classes for mapping functionality.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with import statements and version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only assigns version and imports classes, then defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup without suspicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version number, imports specific widget classes from a local module, and defines an export list for package usage. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data sources, no hardcoded secrets, and no evidence of obfuscation or malicious logic. All elements appear to be standard package setup code for a Python module, likely related to mapping widgets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It simply defines version info and imports necessary classes for export.",
