  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**  \n- The code is straightforward: defines a version tuple, constructs a version string, imports several widget classes from a local module, and sets `__all__` for exports.  \n- No dynamic code, input handling, external data, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- All reports agree that the code is benign and standard for module setup.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and typical for a Python package module.  \n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.  \n- No mention of potential issues like dependency vulnerabilities, but given the simplicity, this is reasonable.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `confidence: 1`.  \n- These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**  \n- The highest risk score is 0, indicating no security concern.  \n- The code is static, with no external data or dynamic behavior.  \n- No reason to increase scores.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**  \n- Malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**  \n- The reports assume the code is benign, which aligns with the code content.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report**  \n- All scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a simple module setup, defining version info and importing classes.  \n- No external data, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.  \n- All evidence points to a benign, standard package module.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are appropriate given the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep the scores as is.  \n- No further security concerns are indicated by this code snippet.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
