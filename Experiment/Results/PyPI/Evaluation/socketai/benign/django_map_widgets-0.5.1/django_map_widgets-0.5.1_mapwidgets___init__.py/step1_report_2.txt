  "purpose": "Define version and import specific widget classes for mapping functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from a tuple and imports widget classes from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No obfuscation or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a version string, imports a set of widget classes related to map functionalities, and defines the exported symbols. It is straightforward and follows typical module setup conventions without any unusual patterns or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for mapping widgets with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
