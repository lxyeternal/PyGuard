  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines a version tuple, converts it into a string, and imports several widget classes from a local `.widgets` module.\n- It then defines `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup, with no dynamic behavior, no input/output handling, and no external data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward, with static assignments and imports. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The report summaries correctly interpret the code as a typical package setup.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as network access, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct. There is no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is justified. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports correctly assume the code is benign, with no evidence to suggest otherwise.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the code and the detailed reports, I concur that this module is a standard, benign setup for a mapping widget library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code, as all evidence points toward a typical package initialization module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward module for defining version info and importing widget classes. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
