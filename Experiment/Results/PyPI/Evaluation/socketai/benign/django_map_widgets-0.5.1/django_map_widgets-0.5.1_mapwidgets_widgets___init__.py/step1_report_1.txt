  "purpose": "This code module imports specific widget classes related to map visualization from local submodules for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from relative modules (.googlemap, .leaflet, .mapbox).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data is processed or output generated from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from source to sink; this is merely an import/export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and no dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list to specify public API symbols. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no network activity. The import statements and list are standard for organizing Python packages. The code appears clean, straightforward, and intended solely for module interface purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a simple interface to expose specific classes for map widgets. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a benign, standard Python module with no security concerns.",
