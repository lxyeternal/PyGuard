  "purpose": "This code module imports specific widget classes related to map interfaces from local submodules and defines an export list for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .googlemap, .leaflet, and .mapbox",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or output functions",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident; merely imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward, performing import/export operations only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of importing specific classes from local modules and listing them in __all__ for module exports. There are no input reads, no data processing, no network operations, or dynamic code execution. It is a standard module structure, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import/export setup for map widget classes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger project.",
