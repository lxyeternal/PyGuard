  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code solely consists of import statements from local modules (`.googlemap`, `.leaflet`, `.mapbox`) and defines an `__all__` list to specify exported symbols.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, data processing, network calls, or handling of untrusted inputs.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward module interface setup, organizing and exposing specific classes for external use.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n   - The code is static, well-structured, and typical for Python package modules.\n\n3. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n   - Their confidence levels are high (1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified, given the static import/export pattern.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code only imports and re-exports classes, it cannot be malicious unless the imported modules themselves are malicious.\n   - Without access to the contents of `.googlemap`, `.leaflet`, or `.mapbox`, we cannot evaluate their internal security. However, based solely on this module, there is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores?**\n   - No, because the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Clear, straightforward import/export statements.            |\n| Security Risk      | 0      | No data processing, external calls, or vulnerabilities.     |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the existing scores. The module poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. It is a typical Python module organizing class exports for map widget components.",
