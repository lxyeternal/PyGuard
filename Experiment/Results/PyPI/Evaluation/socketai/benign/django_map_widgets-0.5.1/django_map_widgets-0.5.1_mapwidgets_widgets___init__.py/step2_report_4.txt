  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.googlemap, .leaflet, .mapbox) and an `__all__` list defining exported symbols.\n   - There are no runtime operations, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward module interface for exposing specific widget classes.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only imports and re-exports classes without any data flow, external communication, or suspicious activity.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, reflecting no security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that since the code only performs imports and exports, it cannot be malicious. This is a reasonable assumption.\n   - No evidence suggests any hidden malicious behavior or backdoors.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a simple, standard module that organizes and exposes classes related to map widgets.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No further action or increased risk scoring is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign and poses no security concerns.",
