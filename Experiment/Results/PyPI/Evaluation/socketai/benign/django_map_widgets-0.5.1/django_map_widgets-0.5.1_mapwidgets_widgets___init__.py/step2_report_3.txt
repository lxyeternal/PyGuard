  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports specific widget classes from local modules (.googlemap, .leaflet, .mapbox).\n- It defines an `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported from the module.\n- The code is straightforward, serving as an interface or API layer for map widget components.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code appears clean, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or input handling.\n- The import/export pattern is standard for Python modules.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flow, external communication, or suspicious patterns.\n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**No errors or flaws are apparent in the reports' reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each report\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is purely import/export with no runtime data processing, the overall risk is minimal.\n- The risk score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, reflecting no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate malware score\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or behaviors.\n- No signs of malware or backdoors.\n\n**Confirmed: malware score should remain 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- All reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis.\n- Given the simplicity, this assumption is sound.\n- No hidden or dynamic malicious behavior is suggested or detectable in this static snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores with the report\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My own assessment\n**Based on the code and reports, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a straightforward module interface, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The uniformity of reports and scores is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, well-structured, and standard.\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of security issues.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.**",
