  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific map widget classes from local submodules and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .googlemap, .leaflet, and .mapbox modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Importing classes from local modules without any data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports specific classes and defines an __all__ list. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reviews agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for organizing and exposing map widget classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
