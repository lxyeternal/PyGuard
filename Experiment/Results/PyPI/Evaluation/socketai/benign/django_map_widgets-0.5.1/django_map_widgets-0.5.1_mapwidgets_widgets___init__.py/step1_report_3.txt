{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific widget classes from local modules related to mapping libraries and then exports them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads local module files: .googlemap, .leaflet, and .mapbox, importing specific classes from each.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks in this snippet; no data is written or transmitted, and no untrusted input handling is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is evident in this code fragment; it only imports and exports class references.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely performs imports and declaration of __all__, with no signs of unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward module that organizes and re-exports widget classes related to mapping functionalities. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or user input handling. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or other signs of malicious activity. The structure and content suggest standard package organization.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet. It appears to be a normal, benign module focused on organizing and exporting classes for a mapping feature.",
