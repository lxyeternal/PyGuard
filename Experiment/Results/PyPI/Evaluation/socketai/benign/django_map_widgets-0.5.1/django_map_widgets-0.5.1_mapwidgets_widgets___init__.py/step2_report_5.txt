  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements importing specific classes from local modules (.googlemap, .leaflet, .mapbox).\n   - It defines an `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward module interface, organizing and exposing classes for map widgets.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources, no external inputs, and no outputs or network activity.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Review of Report Conclusions:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code is present.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural, with no suspicious elements.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here; the code is typical for module exports.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, with no security issues.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assessments provided.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The confidence remains high, given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe module interface with no security concerns.",
