  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes from local submodules (.googlemap, .leaflet, .mapbox) and then defines an `__all__` list to specify the public API. There are no functions, no data processing, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The code is clean, standard, and intended solely for module interface purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that this is a simple import/export module with no security concerns.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code does not perform any suspicious operations, handle untrusted input, or include any malicious payloads.\n- No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The purpose is purely organizational, exposing class references for other modules.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the detailed reviews and the code's nature, I agree with the consensus that this is a benign, standard module with no security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, well-structured module that imports and re-exports classes related to map widgets. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring is accurate.",
