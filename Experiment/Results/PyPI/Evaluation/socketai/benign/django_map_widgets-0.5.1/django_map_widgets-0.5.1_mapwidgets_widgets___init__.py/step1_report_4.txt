{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be defining an interface or API for map widget components, likely used in a web application or framework for geographical data visualization.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code imports modules and defines an export list (__all__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only handles module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for specific widget classes and a list defining what symbols to export. It lacks any runtime data processing, user input handling, or external communication. It appears to be a straightforward module interface declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The simplicity and clarity of the code suggest it is a benign, structural part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import/export pattern used for organizing widget components related to map visualization. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
