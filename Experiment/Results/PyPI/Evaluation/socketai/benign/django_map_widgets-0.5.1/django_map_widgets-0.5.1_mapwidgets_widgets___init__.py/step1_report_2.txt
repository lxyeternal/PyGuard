{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for various map widget classes imported from local modules related to Google Maps, Leaflet, and Mapbox integrations.",
  "sources": "The code imports specific classes from local modules (.googlemap, .leaflet, .mapbox).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; the code only imports and exports class references without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing classes and re-exporting them via __all__; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard import and export statements without any unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific classes from local modules and defining an export list. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling. It appears to be a typical module setup for a Python package managing map widgets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import/export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
