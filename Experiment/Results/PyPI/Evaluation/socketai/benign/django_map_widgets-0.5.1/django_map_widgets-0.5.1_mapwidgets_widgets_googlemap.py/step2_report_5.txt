  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as implementing Google Map widgets within Django, including URL signing for static maps.\n- They consistently note that secrets are retrieved from configuration (`mw_settings`) and decoded from base64, which is standard.\n- No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation are reported.\n- The URL signing process uses HMAC SHA1 with the decoded secret, aligning with Google’s recommended approach.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are identified.\n- The main concern highlighted is the handling of secrets, which is typical for such implementations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:**  \n  The code performs URL signing, constructs URLs with API keys, and handles secrets properly. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**  \n  The only minor potential flaw is the decoding of the secret without validation, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky. No critical errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 across all reports.\n  - Security risk: 0.2, which seems reasonable given the handling of secrets.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  The code's risk is low, but the handling of secrets always warrants caution. Since secrets are stored in configuration, the risk is primarily if secrets are leaked elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n- **Report 1 & 2:**  \n  Both conclude no malicious behavior, standard URL signing, and no obfuscation. Their confidence (0.9) is appropriate. Malware score (0) is justified.\n\n- **Report 3 & 4:**  \n  Similar conclusions, emphasizing standard practices, no suspicious code, and proper secret handling. Their scores seem appropriate.\n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  Highlights the potential risk of secrets in configuration but finds no malicious activity. The analysis aligns with the others.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity or payload.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the handling of secrets and standard implementation, a risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable. It reflects the potential for secret exposure if misconfigured but is not indicative of an active vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments to scores:**  \n  No significant changes needed; the scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  Ensure secrets are stored securely and not exposed in logs or error messages. Proper secret management minimizes the residual risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final verdict:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**       | **0.2** |\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented Google Map widget integration with proper URL signing, and there is no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, assuming secrets are properly protected in configuration.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious behavior. The scores are justified and should remain as is.",
