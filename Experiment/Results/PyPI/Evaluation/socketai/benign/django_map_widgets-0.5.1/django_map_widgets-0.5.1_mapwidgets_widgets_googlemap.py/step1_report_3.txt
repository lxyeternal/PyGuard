{
  "purpose": "This code defines various Google Map widget classes for a Django application, providing interactive and static map functionalities, including URL signing for static map requests.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (mw_settings), URL parameters, user-provided coordinates.",
  "sinks": "Signed URLs, map API URLs, and image URLs generated for static maps.",
  "flows": "Configuration data -> URL construction -> URL signing (if secret available) -> Map API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets in code; URL signing relies on secrets stored in settings. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses external configuration for API keys and secrets. The _google_map_js_url property constructs a Google Maps JavaScript API URL with parameters. The sign_url method signs static map URLs with HMAC SHA1 if a secret is configured, following Google’s digital signature process. The get_image_url_params method constructs parameters for static map images, including markers and center points, based on input coordinates. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. The code relies on external, presumably secure, settings for API keys and secrets. No data exfiltration or hidden behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, with standard use of Google Maps APIs and proper signing procedures if secrets are provided. No malicious intent or malware is detected. It is well-structured and does not contain suspicious anomalies.",
