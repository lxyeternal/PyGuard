{
  "purpose": "Provides URL signing and parameter construction for Google Map static and interactive widgets within a Django application, ensuring secure API requests.",
  "sources": "API key and secret from mw_settings; URL parameters for static and dynamic maps; input coordinates for markers and center.",
  "sinks": "Constructed signed URLs for static maps; JavaScript URLs for interactive maps; URL parameters for map rendering.",
  "flows": "API key and secret are retrieved from configuration -> URL parameters are assembled -> URL is signed with HMAC SHA1 -> signed URL is returned for map rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard URL signing process; secrets decoded from base64 without validation but consistent with Google's guidelines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Google Maps URL signing and parameter generation, using secrets from configuration and following Google's documented approach. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The signing process decodes secrets from base64, which is typical, and uses HMAC SHA1 for URL signature. The API keys and secrets are managed via configuration, not hardcoded. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with best practices. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Google Map widget integration in Django, with proper URL signing and parameter handling. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The handling of secrets, while sensitive, follows best practices. The low risk score reflects the standard nature of the implementation and the importance of secure secret management outside the code.",
