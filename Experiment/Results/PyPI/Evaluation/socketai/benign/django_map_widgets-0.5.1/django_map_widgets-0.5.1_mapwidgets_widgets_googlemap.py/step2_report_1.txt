  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of Google Map widgets within Django.\n- The URL signing process uses base64 decoding of secrets, HMAC SHA1 signing, and appending signatures, following Google's documented approach.\n- No hardcoded credentials are present; secrets and API keys are fetched from configuration (`mw_settings`).\n- No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The main concern across reports is the handling of secrets, which are sensitive but managed via configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of Reported Issues:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code correctly implements URL signing, parameter construction, and widget rendering as described. No discrepancies or missing functionality are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior. They recognize that secrets are decoded from base64 and used for HMAC signing, which is standard.\n\n- **Potential misinterpretations?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume malicious intent where none exists. They acknowledge the standard nature of the implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Score Validity and Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; there's no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign `0`. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign `0.2`. Given the handling of secrets and the potential impact if secrets are leaked, this seems reasonable. The code itself does not introduce additional risks.\n\n### Additional Justifications:\n\n- The only notable point is the handling of secrets via decoding from base64. If secrets are exposed in logs or errors, that could be a concern, but this is a common practice and not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No report overstates or understates the risks.\n- The understanding that secrets are sensitive but managed properly aligns with best practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (manageable, related to secret handling, but standard)\n\n**Note:** If secrets are properly stored and protected in configuration, the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented Google Map widget integration for Django.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The handling of secrets, while sensitive, follows typical practices.\n- The risk score is appropriate; it could be slightly higher if secrets are poorly protected, but that is outside the code's scope.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
