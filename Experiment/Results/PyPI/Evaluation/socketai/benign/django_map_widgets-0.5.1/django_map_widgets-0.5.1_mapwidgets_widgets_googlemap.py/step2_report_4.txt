  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements standard Google Map widget functionality for Django, including URL construction, static map image URL signing, and parameter generation.\n- The signing process uses HMAC SHA1 with a base64-decoded secret, following Google's documented approach.\n- API keys and secrets are retrieved from configuration (`mw_settings`), not hardcoded, which is best practice.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, such as obfuscated logic, code injection, or backdoors, is detected.\n- The code does not perform any network requests beyond constructing URLs for Google Maps API, which is expected.\n- The main concern is the handling and security of secrets, but this is a common and accepted practice if secrets are properly protected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Issues are not present** in the code snippets; the code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation.\n- **No errors or flaws** in logic or reasoning are evident.\n- **Scores assigned** (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) seem reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points on the scores:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct. The code is clear, uses standard libraries, and no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk score (0.2):** Slightly elevated but justified, considering the handling of secrets and URL signing. If secrets are exposed or mishandled, risks increase, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for risk score > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, and given the code's nature, a higher score isn't justified unless secrets are misconfigured or exposed, which isn't indicated here.\n\n---\n\n### Malware assessment:\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code performs no malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume secrets are handled securely, which depends on external configuration (`mw_settings`). If secrets are stored insecurely, risks increase, but the code itself does not expose or mishandle secrets.\n- No signs of code obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.\n- The URL signing process is correct and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The confidence levels (0.9) are justified given the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions. The code is a typical implementation of Google Map widgets with proper URL signing and parameter handling. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to secret handling, but standard practice)\n\n**Overall, the code appears secure and legitimate.**",
