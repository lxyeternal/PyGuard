  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code constructs Google Maps API URLs (JavaScript and static maps).\n- It signs static map URLs with HMAC SHA1 using a secret decoded from base64, following Google’s recommended approach.\n- API keys and secrets are fetched from configuration (`mw_settings`), not hardcoded.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code is evident.\n- No network requests are performed directly; only URL construction/signing occurs.\n- The code handles secrets properly, assuming correct configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Confirmation:**\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code signs URLs with a secret decoded from base64, which is standard for Google Maps static API URL signing.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n\n- **All reports** correctly identify that the code signs URLs using a base64-decoded secret with HMAC SHA1, following Google's guidelines.\n- **Potential concern**: The reports mention that secrets are decoded from base64 without validation. This is true, but this is standard practice for Google’s URL signing process.  \n- **No actual flaws or mistakes** in the code logic are identified by the reports. They correctly note that the code is standard and follows best practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Analysis and Justification:**\n\n#### **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code only constructs and signs URLs, which is benign.\n\n#### **Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.  \n- **Justification:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n#### **Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign `securityRisk: 0.2` (low).  \n- **Justification:** The main risk involves handling secrets, which are stored in configuration, not hardcoded. If secrets are exposed, it could be problematic, but this is a standard risk for API integrations, not a specific flaw in the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- They correctly state that the code follows standard practices and does not perform suspicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk, standard URL signing.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Critical Considerations:**\n\n- **Secret Handling:** The secret is decoded from base64, which is standard, but if the secret is misconfigured or leaked, signing could be compromised. The code does not perform validation of the secret's format or integrity, but that’s typical.\n- **Potential exposure:** The only real concern is secret management, but that’s outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n**Based on the reports and code review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** seems appropriate, considering secret handling risks, but not high.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (due to secret handling, but this is standard practice and not a flaw)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented Google Maps widget integration with URL signing. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The only minor concern relates to secret management, which is a common risk but not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. Ensure secrets are stored securely in configuration and not exposed inadvertently.\n\n---\n\n**End of analysis.**",
