  "purpose": "Provides custom Google Map widgets for Django forms, including static and interactive maps with URL signing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Access to settings variables (mw_settings), URL parameters, and input coordinates.",
  "sinks": "URL signing process and external API calls to Google Maps API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Retrieves API keys and secrets from settings -> constructs URLs for JavaScript and static map images -> signs URLs if secret is provided -> generates map parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding on secrets; URL signing with HMAC, which is standard; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors; no code injection or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with Google Maps API, using configuration data from settings and generating URLs for map display and static images. The URL signing process uses a base64-encoded secret key decoded for HMAC SHA1 signing, which is standard for Google Maps URL signing. No hardcoded credentials are present; secrets are fetched from configuration. The code does not perform any network connections directly but constructs URLs for external API calls, which is typical for map widgets. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection is evident. The only potential concern is the handling of secrets, but since they are sourced from settings, this is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for integrating Google Maps widgets into Django, with proper handling of API keys, URL signing, and map parameter generation. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The security posture is normal for this type of functionality.",
