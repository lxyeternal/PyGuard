{
  "purpose": "This code provides Django widgets for Google Map integration, including static and interactive map features, with URL signing for static map requests.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings from mw_settings, particularly API keys and secrets; accesses request URLs for signing.",
  "sinks": "Uses API keys and secrets to generate and sign URLs; potentially exposes sensitive data if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Retrieves API keys/secrets, constructs Google Maps URLs, signs static map URLs using HMAC, and generates map parameters including markers and center points.",
  "anomalies": "The code signs URLs with a secret, which is standard, but the secret is decoded from base64 without validation; no hardcoded credentials are present; no unusual or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of Google Map widgets within Django, including URL construction and signing for static maps. The URL signing process correctly decodes a base64 secret, signs the URL with HMAC SHA1, and appends the signature. No malicious payload, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only concern could be misconfiguration or exposure of the API secret in logs or errors, but this is a general risk with secrets, not malicious intent. The code does not perform any network requests beyond Google Maps API calls, nor does it contain any obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Google Map widgets with proper URL signing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles secrets appropriately, assuming correct configuration, with no evident malware or security risks beyond typical secret handling concerns.",
