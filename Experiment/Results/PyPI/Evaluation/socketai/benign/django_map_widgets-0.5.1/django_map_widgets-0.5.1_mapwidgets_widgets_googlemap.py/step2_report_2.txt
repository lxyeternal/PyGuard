  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's function—Django widgets for Google Maps, reading API keys and secrets from settings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes URL construction, signing, and parameter handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. URL signing with HMAC SHA1 is standard, secrets are fetched from configuration, and no obfuscation is present.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment aligns with the code. The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, and malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices—configuration-based secrets, URL signing, and no malicious code.\n- The analysis correctly notes that secrets are handled via configuration, with no hardcoded credentials.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on URL signing, configuration, and parameter generation.\n- Correctly states that no suspicious or malicious behavior is observed.\n- The risk score of 0.2 matches the typical risk of secret exposure if misconfigured but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights the same points—standard URL signing, configuration-based secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Correctly notes that the signing process is standard and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis: URL signing, configuration secrets, no malicious activity.\n- Correctly identifies that untrusted coordinates are used in map parameters, but this is expected behavior.\n- No signs of malware or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of Google Map widget functionality, with proper URL signing.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The main concern is the handling of secrets, which are stored in configuration—this is standard but requires secure management.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 remains appropriate, reflecting typical concerns over secret management but not an active security threat.\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\nThe code appears legitimate, well-structured, and aligned with best practices for Google Maps integration in Django. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, secure implementation for Google Map widgets.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The risk is minimal and related to secret management, not code behavior.\n\n**Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nPlease proceed with these assessments.",
