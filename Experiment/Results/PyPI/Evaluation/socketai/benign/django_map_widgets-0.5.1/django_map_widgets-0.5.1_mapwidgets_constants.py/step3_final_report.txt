{
  "purpose": "Static dictionary mapping timezone names to geographic coordinates for geolocation or timezone calculations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded timezone identifiers and their associated coordinate pairs within the dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used for lookup purposes.",
  "flows": "N/A — static data; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; data appears straightforward, static, and well-formed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary with timezone names as keys and coordinate lists as values. No dynamic code, input/output operations, or external dependencies are present. The data is purely informational, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's structure and content suggest it is a safe, static resource for timezone geolocation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data dictionary mapping timezone names to coordinates. It poses no security or malware threat, and the scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
