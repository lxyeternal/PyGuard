{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping timezone identifiers to their respective geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded directly within the dictionary definition; no external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks exists, as the code only contains static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The data appears to be a static mapping of timezones to coordinates; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden logic are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary containing timezone names as keys and coordinate lists as values. It lacks any dynamic or executable logic, external input processing, or code that could be malicious. The data appears to be legitimate geographic information. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are identified. There are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation; the structure and content are clear and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and solely contains a static data structure mapping timezone identifiers to geographic coordinates. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
