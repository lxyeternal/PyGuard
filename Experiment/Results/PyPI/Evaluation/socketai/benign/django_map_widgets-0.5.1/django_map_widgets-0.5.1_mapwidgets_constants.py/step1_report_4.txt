{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping timezone identifiers to their respective geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). It appears intended for geographic or timezone-related calculations or lookups.",
  "sources": "The data source is a static dictionary embedded in the code, containing hardcoded timezone-to-coordinate mappings.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; the code does not perform I/O, network operations, or any data processing beyond static data storage.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing are present; the code simply initializes a static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a large static dictionary with coordinate data. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static mapping of timezone names to geographic coordinates. It does not perform any data input, output, or processing. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic is present. The data appears consistent and well-structured, serving as a static lookup table. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely informational, serving as a static reference for timezone coordinates. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks.",
