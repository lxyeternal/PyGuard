  "purpose": "Defines a dictionary mapping timezone names to their geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude).",
  "sources": "The dictionary declaration itself; no external data input or dynamic data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations; static data structure only.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs; static assignment of data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, hardcoded mapping of timezone identifiers to coordinate pairs. It contains no dynamic execution, input/output operations, or external dependencies. The data appears to be a comprehensive list of geographic coordinates for numerous global time zones, without any embedded logic, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior indicators. The structure is straightforward, and no code execution or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data dictionary mapping time zone names to coordinates, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate resource for timezone-related data.",
