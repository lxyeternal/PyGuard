  "purpose": "Definition of a dictionary mapping timezone names to their geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).",
  "sources": "The dictionary TIMEZONE_COORDINATES itself is a static data structure; no input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to untrusted or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the dictionary is static data only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely a large static dictionary with geographic coordinates; no obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or unusual patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comprehensive static dictionary mapping timezone identifiers to coordinate pairs. It appears to be intended for geographic lookups or timezone handling. No input/output operations, no dynamic code, no external network or file interactions, and no embedded malicious code or backdoors are visible. The structure and format are straightforward, with comments indicating coordinate pairs. The data set is large but static and well-formed. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data structure with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward mapping of timezone names to coordinates, likely intended for geographic or timezone-related functionalities.",
