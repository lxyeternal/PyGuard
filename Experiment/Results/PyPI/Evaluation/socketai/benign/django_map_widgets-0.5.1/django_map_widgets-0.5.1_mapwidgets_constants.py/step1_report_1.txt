  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary mapping timezone names to their geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).",
  "sources": "The data source appears to be a static hardcoded dictionary within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks, such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks, in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or data; the data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code consists solely of a static dictionary definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large, static mapping of timezone names to geographic coordinates, with no dynamic execution, no input/output operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code features. It is simply a data structure initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code injection, or malicious intent. No external dependencies or network activity are present. The data appears to be a comprehensive list of timezones and their associated coordinates, likely used for geolocation or timezone-related functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static data dictionary with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is unlikely to be malicious or a security risk.",
