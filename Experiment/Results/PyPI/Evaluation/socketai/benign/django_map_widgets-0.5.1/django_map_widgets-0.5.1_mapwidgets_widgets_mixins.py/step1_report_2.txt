{
  "purpose": "The code defines two mixin classes for managing settings and rendering JavaScript widget data in a web application, likely related to form handling and map widget integration.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters such as 'settings', 'name', 'value', 'attrs', 'renderer', and 'element_id'. It also reads the class attribute '_settings' and 'custom_settings'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data from 'custom_settings' or 'attrs' is used insecurely. The code generates JSON data for JavaScript but properly serializes it with json.dumps, which is safe. No execution of untrusted code occurs.",
  "flows": "Untrusted 'settings' data flows into the 'settings' property; 'attrs' input influences 'render' and the generated 'js_widget_data'; this data is serialized into JSON for client-side use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Use of string formatting in 'get_js_widget_data' appears standard. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining mixins for settings management and widget rendering. It validates 'custom_settings' to be a dict, preventing obvious injection through that route. The 'render' method updates 'attrs' with JSON serialized widget data, which is safely handled via json.dumps. No insecure code or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or execute untrusted code. It appears to be a typical implementation for a Django form widget with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard settings management and widget rendering without any signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It appears safe and consistent with typical web application code.",
