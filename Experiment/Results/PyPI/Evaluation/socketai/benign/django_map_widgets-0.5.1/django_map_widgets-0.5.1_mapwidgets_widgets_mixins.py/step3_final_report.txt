  "purpose": "Provides Django mixins for settings management and widget rendering with safe data handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'settings', 'name', 'value', 'attrs', 'renderer', and 'element_id'; data serialization via json.dumps.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization and property access; no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'settings' flows into 'self.settings'; 'name' and 'element_id' flow into 'get_js_widget_data'; serialized into 'js_widget_params' and included in 'attrs' for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' for type validation; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two mixins for handling settings and widget data in Django forms. It validates 'settings' type, serializes widget data with json.dumps, and renders HTML attributes. No malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward, with proper validation and safe data handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity are detected. The data flows are typical for Django widgets, and the code does not perform any network or file operations. The use of 'assert' is benign in this context. Overall, the code is standard, safe, and free of security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Django widget handling, with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score of 0.2 is appropriate but could be lowered to 0 given the absence of vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
