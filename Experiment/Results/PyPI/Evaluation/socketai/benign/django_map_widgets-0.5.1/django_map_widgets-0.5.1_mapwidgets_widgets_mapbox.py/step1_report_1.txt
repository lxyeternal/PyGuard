  "purpose": "This code defines Django widgets for integrating Mapbox maps, including interactive and static map widgets for form fields.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include mw_settings.Mapbox.accessToken, coordinates passed to methods, and widget settings such as overlayParams and thumbnailSize.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network requests to Mapbox API URLs constructed in get_image_url, get_thumbnail_url, and get_html_image_tag_attrs, which include access tokens and URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration settings (accessToken, overlayParams, mapParams) to URL construction functions, which generate API request URLs for static images or map scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code properly checks for access tokens before making network requests. URL formatting appears standard. No data leaks or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves the Mapbox access token from settings and raises exceptions if missing, preventing misuse. URL construction methods correctly encode parameters and do not include sensitive info in URL paths. External scripts and stylesheets are loaded from trusted Mapbox CDN URLs. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage; all network requests are to legitimate Mapbox services. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe, with appropriate handling of access tokens and external resources. No malicious intent or security risks detected based on this review.",
