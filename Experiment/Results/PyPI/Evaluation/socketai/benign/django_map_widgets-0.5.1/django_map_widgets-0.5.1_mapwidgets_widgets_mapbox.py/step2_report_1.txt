  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code to verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code defines Django widgets for Mapbox, with data sources including `mw_settings.Mapbox.accessToken`, coordinates, and widget settings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests to Mapbox URLs are generated, with data flowing from settings and input coordinates.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. Proper checks for `accessToken` are present. External resources are from Mapbox CDN URLs, which are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with high confidence (0.9), and malware risk is 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the widget functions and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL generation based on settings and coordinates, with validation for access tokens.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. External URLs are standard. No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also accurate, with malware score 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the widget classes, data inputs, and URL construction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper URL generation, with validation for access tokens.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. External resources are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior, malware score 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No security issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the purpose and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL creation and validation are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. External dependencies are from Mapbox CDN.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate conclusion, malware 0, risk 0.1, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the widget classes, configuration, and URL construction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper validation for access tokens, URL generation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. External URLs are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment, malware 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. It correctly checks for `Mapbox.accessToken` before making API calls.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores are consistently 0 across all reports, matching the code's behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), mainly due to reliance on external configuration, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, due to external dependencies and configuration reliance, but no real security flaw.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I recommend maintaining proper access token management and monitoring for any future updates, but as of now, no security concerns are evident.",
