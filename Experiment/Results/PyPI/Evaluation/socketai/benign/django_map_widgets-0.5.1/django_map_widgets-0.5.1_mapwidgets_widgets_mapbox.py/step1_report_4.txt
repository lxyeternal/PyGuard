{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom Django widgets for integrating Mapbox maps, both interactive and static, into forms and static content.",
  "sources": "Code reads configuration settings from mw_settings (including access tokens and style parameters), and potentially reads coordinates passed into methods.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs URLs for Mapbox API requests and includes access tokens; URL parameters are generated from settings and input coordinates.",
  "flows": "Settings are retrieved from configuration; access tokens are included in URL parameters; coordinates are used to generate overlay strings and static image URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; no suspicious URL or data exfiltration mechanisms; no obfuscated code; proper validation of access tokens before use; URL construction appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code loads access tokens and style parameters from configuration, ensuring these are required before generating URLs. The URL generation for static images and map resources relies on input coordinates and configurable parameters, with no evident malicious transformations or obfuscation. External URLs are standard Mapbox CDN links. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The code performs expected operations for widget rendering and URL creation, with proper error handling for missing access tokens. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django widget code for integrating Mapbox maps, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It correctly handles configuration dependencies and constructs URLs for map resources without suspicious modifications.",
