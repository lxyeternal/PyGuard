  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided summaries.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Summary**: The code defines Django widgets for Mapbox, checks for access tokens, loads external scripts/styles, constructs URLs, and makes network requests to Mapbox APIs.\n- **Assessment**: The report correctly notes the presence of access token validation, external resource loading, and URL construction. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Scores**: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid, consistent, and appropriately cautious.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment variable checks, URL generation, and external resources.\n- **Assessment**: No malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is standard for such widgets.\n- **Scores**: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- **Summary**: Focuses on URL generation, validation of access tokens, and safe external resource loading.\n- **Assessment**: No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores**: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Correct.\n- **Conclusion**: Well-founded.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- **Summary**: Highlights configuration, URL construction, and validation, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Assessment**: No malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is standard.\n- **Scores**: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly lower risk, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- **Summary**: Similar to others, emphasizing configuration, URL generation, and validation.\n- **Assessment**: No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores**: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues**: No, all reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning**: None apparent; all reports agree on the benign nature.\n- **Scores**:\n  - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n  - **Obfuscated**: All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n  - **Risk**: Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the code's function.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code relies on environment variables for sensitive tokens, which is good practice.\n- URL construction is straightforward, with no signs of injection or malicious payloads.\n- External resources are from trusted CDNs.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (low, mainly due to external dependencies and configuration reliance)\n\n**Summary**: The supply chain security risk appears minimal, with no evidence of malicious intent or code sabotage. The code is a standard implementation for Mapbox integration in Django, with appropriate security checks and resource loading.\n\n**Final note**: I concur with the existing scores and assessments.",
