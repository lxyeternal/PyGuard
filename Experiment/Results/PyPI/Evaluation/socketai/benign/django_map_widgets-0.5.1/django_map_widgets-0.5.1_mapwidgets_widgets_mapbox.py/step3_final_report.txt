{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django widgets for Mapbox integration, handling configuration, URL generation, and resource loading for interactive and static map displays.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (`mw_settings.Mapbox.accessToken`, widget settings, coordinates input), external URLs for scripts, styles, and static map images.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Mapbox APIs for static images and map resources, URL construction with access tokens, external resource loading.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates and widget settings flow into URL and overlay generation functions, which then produce network requests to Mapbox endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; proper validation for access tokens present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of access tokens, constructs URLs for static and interactive maps, and loads resources from trusted Mapbox CDN URLs. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. External dependencies are from official sources, and the code structure is clear and straightforward. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of Mapbox widgets for Django, with proper validation and resource handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The supply chain security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for deployment.",
