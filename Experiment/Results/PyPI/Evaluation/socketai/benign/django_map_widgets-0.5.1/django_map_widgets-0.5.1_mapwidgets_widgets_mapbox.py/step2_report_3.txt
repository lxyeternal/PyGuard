  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's purpose and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes network requests to Mapbox APIs, which are expected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious or malicious code, proper token handling, external resources from trusted sources.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Concludes the code is safe with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code properly checks for the access token, constructs URLs with parameters, and loads scripts/styles from Mapbox CDN URLs. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (low, given external dependencies and token handling)  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, accurately describes data flow.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes URL generation and external resource loading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, standard URL construction, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code performs expected validation and URL generation, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (still low)  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the widget's purpose and data inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes URL construction based on settings and coordinates.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, standard external URLs, straightforward overlay string creation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Finds no malicious behavior, considers code safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code's operations. The code validates tokens, constructs URLs securely, and loads resources from trusted sources.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (low)  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly describes URL generation and parameter handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, standard URL building, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard implementation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code performs expected validation and URL creation without suspicious patterns.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low)  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the widget classes and configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes URL and overlay generation based on settings.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, proper validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Finds no malicious behavior, standard code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code validates tokens, constructs URLs properly, and loads resources from trusted sources.  \n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (low)  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting low but present external dependencies and configuration reliance.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- It performs proper validation of access tokens.\n- External resources are loaded from trusted Mapbox CDN URLs.\n- URL construction is straightforward, with no suspicious parameters or data leaks.\n- No signs of malware, malicious payloads, or sabotage.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed safe)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies and configuration reliance, but no immediate threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears secure and legitimate.",
