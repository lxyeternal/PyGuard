{
  "purpose": "Define custom Mapbox widget classes for interactive and static map display within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (`mw_settings.Mapbox.*`), external Mapbox API URLs, environment variables (`Mapbox.accessToken`), class properties and methods receiving parameters.",
  "sinks": "External Mapbox API URLs, string formatting for URLs and overlays, raising exceptions based on configuration, updating class settings with user-supplied data.",
  "flows": "Settings properties access `mw_settings`, which may include sensitive tokens; URL generation methods build URLs incorporating these settings; `get_overlay` and URL formatting functions process input coordinates and configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no obfuscated code; exception raising for missing access tokens is standard but could indicate reliance on external configuration. No suspicious or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two widget classes for Mapbox integration, utilizing external API URLs and configuration settings. It raises exceptions if required tokens are missing, which is appropriate. URL construction and overlay generation rely on provided settings and input data, with no signs of malicious code or data leaks. No data is transmitted directly within this code; all network calls depend on external API URLs constructed from settings and inputs. There are no hidden or obfuscated behaviors, backdoors, or malware patterns. The code primarily handles URL generation and configuration validation, typical for widget rendering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Mapbox widget classes within Django, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external configurations and does not perform any suspicious operations or data exfiltration. No malware or supply chain sabotage behaviors are evident.",
