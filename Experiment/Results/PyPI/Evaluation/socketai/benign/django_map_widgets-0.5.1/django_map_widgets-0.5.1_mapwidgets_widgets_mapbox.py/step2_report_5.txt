  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for Django Mapbox widgets, checks for access token, loads external scripts/styles, constructs URLs, no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or malicious code.  \n- External scripts are from trusted CDNs.  \n- URL generation is standard and secure, with proper token checks.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. The low risk score (0.2) reflects minor concerns, mainly about external dependencies, which are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard Mapbox widget code, proper token validation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code.  \n- URL construction and external resource loading are standard.  \n- No signs of backdoors or data exfiltration.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem appropriate. The low security risk score aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard Mapbox widget code, uses environment variables, URL generation based on input, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Proper validation for access tokens.  \n- External URLs are standard.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard widget implementation, proper validation, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.  \n- External resources are from Mapbox CDN.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines widget classes, relies on external settings, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Proper validation and URL construction.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior, payload, or backdoor evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** The risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard widget code with external dependencies and environment variable reliance, but no critical vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical implementation of Mapbox widgets in Django.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- External resources are from trusted sources.\n- Proper validation of access tokens is performed.\n- URL generation and overlay construction are straightforward and safe.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with current scores)  \n\nThe low risk score is justified given the code's nature, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable, and the code appears safe and legitimate. No adjustments needed.",
