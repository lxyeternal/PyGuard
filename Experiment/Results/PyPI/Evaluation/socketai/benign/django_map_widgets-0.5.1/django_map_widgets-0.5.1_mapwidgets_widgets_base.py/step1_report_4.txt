{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom Django form widgets for geospatial mapping and static map image rendering, intended for use in web forms and templates.",
  "sources": "Settings imported from mapwidgets.settings (mw_settings), environment variables or external data via URLs, class attributes, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "URL generation functions (get_image_url, get_thumbnail_url) that produce URLs with query parameters, context updates for template rendering, and sign_url method (though currently a pass-through).",
  "flows": "Settings influence URL signing and image URL generation; user-provided values are used in URL parameters; sign_url could potentially modify URLs if overridden.",
  "anomalies": "sign_url method is a placeholder that does not perform actual signing; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors present; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; reliance on class attributes and external settings appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages static and interactive map widgets with proper data handling and URL composition. The sign_url method is a stub and could be exploited if overridden to modify URLs maliciously, but as-is, it does nothing. The URL generation functions utilize safe practices by encoding parameters, and no untrusted data is directly executed or evaluated. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The code appears straightforward and aligns with typical Django widget patterns. The only potential concern is the placeholder sign_url method, which could be exploited if extended improperly in subclasses or external modifications, but in this context, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily providing widget UI components with safe URL handling and no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The only minimal concern is the placeholder sign_url, which, if overridden maliciously, could pose security risks, but in this code, it is harmless.",
