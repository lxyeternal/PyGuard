  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Two classes: `BasePointFieldInteractiveWidget` and `BaseStaticWidget`.\n- They handle media asset inclusion, geospatial data serialization, URL generation for static maps, and context preparation for templates.\n- The `sign_url` method is a placeholder that currently returns the URL unchanged.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- **No**: The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.\n- **Potential concern**: The `sign_url` method is a placeholder, which could be replaced or overridden maliciously to sign URLs with secrets, but as provided, it is benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The placeholder `sign_url` method might be incomplete if URL signing is intended for security, but this is not a flaw per se—just an incomplete feature.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are around 0.2, reflecting a minor concern about the placeholder `sign_url`.\n- The scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The only potential concern is the placeholder `sign_url` method, which if replaced or misused, could lead to security issues, but in the current code, it does not.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n- No malware activity detected.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the placeholder `sign_url` as a potential concern but not malicious.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0.2 (minor concern about the placeholder `sign_url`, but no active vulnerability)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- Given the code, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.2 (due to incomplete signing implementation)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears safe, with no malicious intent. The main point to monitor is the `sign_url` method if later extended to perform actual signing, which could introduce security risks if secrets are mishandled. As it stands, the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious activity.",
