{
  "purpose": "This code defines two Django form widgets for geospatial and static map rendering, including methods for generating media assets, serializing geospatial data, and constructing image URLs with optional signing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'value' parameter in get_context methods, 'geom' parameter in geos_to_dict, and internal settings/configurations such as 'settings' and 'mw_settings'.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into URL construction methods ('get_image_url', 'get_thumbnail_url') and data serialization ('geos_to_dict'), which could lead to URL injection or data manipulation if 'settings' are maliciously altered.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'value' and 'geom' objects through serialization ('geos_to_dict') and URL generation ('get_image_url', 'get_thumbnail_url'), ultimately used in HTML context for image display; 'settings' influence media paths and URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obvious malicious code present. The 'sign_url' method is a placeholder that could be exploited if overridden maliciously, but as shown, it does not perform signing. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles media asset management, geospatial data serialization, and URL construction for static map images. It uses settings-driven configuration for assets and URLs. The 'sign_url' method is a placeholder, not performing real signing, which could be a concern if replaced. URL parameters are generated via 'urlencode' with controlled inputs, and data serialization is straightforward. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The structure appears standard for Django widgets, with no suspicious logic or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical implementation of Django widgets for map visualization, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The main concern is that the 'sign_url' method is a placeholder, which could be exploited if replaced with malicious code, but as provided, it does not perform signing. Overall, the code is safe with low malware and security risk scores.",
