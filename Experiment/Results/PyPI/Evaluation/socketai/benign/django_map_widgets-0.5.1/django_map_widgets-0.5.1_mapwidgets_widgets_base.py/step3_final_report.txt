{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django form widgets for geospatial and static map handling, including media asset management, geospatial data serialization, and URL generation for static images, with a placeholder for URL signing.",
  "sources": "Input 'value' (geospatial data), 'geom' objects, and settings for media assets and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "URL construction via 'urlencode', JSON serialization of widget options and geospatial data, and context data for rendering templates.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'value' or 'geom' through serialization and URL encoding into image URLs or context variables, with 'sign_url' acting as an optional URL signer (currently a no-op).",
  "anomalies": "The 'sign_url' method is a placeholder that does not perform actual signing, which could be exploited if overridden maliciously; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard use of Django widgets, media management, and URL construction. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The placeholder 'sign_url' could be a security concern if replaced with malicious signing logic, but as provided, it is benign. Data flows are safe, and serialization methods are standard. The overall structure indicates low security risk, with the main caveat being the incomplete signing implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential issue is the placeholder 'sign_url' method, which could be exploited if replaced with malicious signing logic. Currently, it does not pose a security threat, and the code can be considered low risk.",
