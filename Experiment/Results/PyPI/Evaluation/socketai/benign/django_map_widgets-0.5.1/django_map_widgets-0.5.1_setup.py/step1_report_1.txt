  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for packaging and distributing the 'django-map-widgets' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; importing modules os and setuptools; accessing __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external influence that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading README file -> setting package metadata -> calling setup() with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for a package. It reads a README file for the long description, defines version info, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No user input, no external data beyond static files, and no suspicious code flows. No indications of malicious intent or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and appears to serve its purpose for packaging a Python project.",
