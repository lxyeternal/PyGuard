  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the django-map-widgets project, defining package metadata and reading the README file.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file; static metadata definitions; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network or dynamic code execution; static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports os and setuptools, reads a static README file for description, defines a version, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. No dynamic code, user input, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. All security signals are absent, and the code follows best practices for packaging. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent; no further action is necessary.",
