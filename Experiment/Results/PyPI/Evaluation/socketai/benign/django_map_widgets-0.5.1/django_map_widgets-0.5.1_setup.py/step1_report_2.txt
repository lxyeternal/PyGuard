{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project called 'django-map-widgets'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.rst' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily reads a file and calls setup() to package the project.",
  "flows": "File reading flow from 'README.rst' to 'long_description', then passing parameters to setup(), which is standard packaging behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', reads a README file for the description, and configures package metadata via setup(). All steps are typical for a Python package setup. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
