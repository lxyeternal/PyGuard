{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'django-map-widgets' Python package, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long_description; no other input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network connections, file writes, or environment modifications beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file -> setup configuration; no dynamic or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures; uses standard setup and package discovery functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and setuptools modules, reads a README file for the package description, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts, with no dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or suspicious behaviors observed. The use of 'find_packages' excludes certain directories but does not introduce risk. The script does not perform network operations, data leaks, or code injection. Overall, the script appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a Django map widget library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It performs typical package setup operations without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
