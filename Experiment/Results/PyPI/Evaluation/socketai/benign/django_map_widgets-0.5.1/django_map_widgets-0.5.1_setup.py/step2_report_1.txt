  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review of the Actual Script:**\n\n- The script is a standard Python `setup.py` for packaging a project named `django-map-widgets`.\n- It imports `os` and `setuptools`, reads a `README.rst` file for the long description, defines a version tuple, and calls `setup()` with package metadata.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, environment variable manipulations, or network operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears to follow best practices for a package setup script.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the script is a typical, benign setup configuration.\n- They identify no suspicious behaviors, no external data flows involving untrusted input, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malware.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty that the code is safe.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as a standard setup script.\n- No anomalies, such as suspicious code patterns or security risks, are detected.\n- The scoring of malware and security risk as 0 is appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is justified. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is justified. The script is a typical setup script with no security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n\n- Since the code is static and reads only a README file, there's no basis for assuming malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern could be if the `README.rst` file was malicious or manipulated, but that is outside the scope of this script itself.\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code or perform operations that could compromise security.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The overall assessment is that this setup script is safe.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security issues.",
