  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'django-map-widgets', including metadata and package information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description, importing os, setuptools functions, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows involving untrusted input or external outputs beyond standard setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: defining version, reading a README file for description, and configuring package metadata. All operations involve static data or file reading with no user input or external data sources. The code uses conventional Python packaging methods without executing untrusted code or performing network operations. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration script.",
