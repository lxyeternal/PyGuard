  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize configuration and logging components for a domain/IP/URL checking tool, likely as part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules: 'PyFunceble.config.loader' and 'PyFunceble.logger'. Assignments of 'ConfigLoader' and 'Logger' from these imports.",
  "sinks": "None present. The code does not process or execute untrusted data within this fragment.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> Instantiate 'ConfigLoader' -> Instantiate 'Logger'.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs import and instantiation without any suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The script imports configuration and logging classes from the PyFunceble library and creates instances of each. This is typical setup code for a larger application. No untrusted input or data manipulation occurs here. The code appears to be straightforward initialization with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code segment is a standard initialization snippet for setting up configuration and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activity are detected.",
