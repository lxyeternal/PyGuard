{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the PyFunceble Python package, managing requirements, version extraction, description, console scripts, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads requirements files, version info from storage.py, README.md for long description, environment variables for console script inclusion, and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "File I/O for requirements and version files, environment variables affecting console script activation, and package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "Requirements files -> set of dependencies; Environment variables -> conditional console scripts; Files -> package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. Use of standard package setup practices. Environment variable checks are typical for conditional features, not malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional Python package setup script with functions to read requirements, determine version, and configure package metadata and entry points. It uses standard Python modules such as os, platform, re, and setuptools. No suspicious code paths, network calls, or hidden functionalities are present. The environment variables influence which console scripts are enabled, which is common in development and production setups. The file handles are properly managed with context managers, and there are no signs of malicious code or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for the PyFunceble package with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for Python package configuration and does not contain any malicious or sabotage code.",
