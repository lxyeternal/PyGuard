  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python package setup script for PyFunceble.\n- They highlight reading requirements, version extraction, description loading, environment-variable-based conditional console scripts, and package metadata.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Minor notes include file handling without context managers in one report, but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a typical setup script with no evident issues or malicious behavior.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; the only minor concern is the lack of context managers for some file reads, which is a common pattern but not malicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- Slightly inconsistent use of `open()` without context managers in one report, but this is a coding style issue, not a security flaw.\n- Version extraction relies on specific file paths, which could break if the project structure changes, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable. The minimal 0.1 risk score reflects a minor concern about file handling practices but not a security threat.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a legitimate setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The environment variable checks for conditional console scripts are standard and not suspicious.\n- The version extraction method is typical for Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe only slight concern is the use of `open()` without context managers in one part, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a normal, well-structured Python package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues. The assessments in the reports are accurate and reasonable.",
