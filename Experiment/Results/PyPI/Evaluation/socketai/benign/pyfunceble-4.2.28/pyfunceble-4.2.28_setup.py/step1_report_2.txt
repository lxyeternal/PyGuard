  "purpose": "This script sets up the package installation for PyFunceble, including requirements, version extraction, description, and entry points for command-line tools.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements files, reading version info from storage.py, reading README.md, environment variables, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "File reads for requirements, version, and README; environment variable checks for conditional behavior; package setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Requirements files are read and processed; environment variables influence which console scripts are included; version and description are extracted from files; finally, the setup() function orchestrates the package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code, suspicious network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code uses standard setup procedures and environment checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup routines: it reads requirement lists, extracts version info from a specific source file, loads the README for the long description, and dynamically configures console scripts based on environment variables. The version extraction uses regex on a specific file path. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as code injection, network activity, or hidden backdoors are detected. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious code. The code appears safe and intended solely for package installation and configuration.",
