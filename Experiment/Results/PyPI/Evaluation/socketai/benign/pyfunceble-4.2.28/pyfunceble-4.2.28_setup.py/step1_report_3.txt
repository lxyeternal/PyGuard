{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the PyFunceble Python package, responsible for package configuration, dependency management, and entry point setup for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from requirements files, package files (PyFunceble/storage.py), README.md, environment variables, and system platform information.",
  "sinks": "Reads from files, environment variables, and platform info; writes package metadata and installs dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input from requirements files and environment variables influences dependencies and console scripts; version info extracted from package files; setup configuration assembled from these sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected. The script performs standard package setup procedures. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code reads configuration and version info from known files, which is typical. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with functions to retrieve requirements, version, description, and console scripts. It handles platform-specific file checks for requirements files, reads version info from package source files, and configures package metadata and entry points accordingly. All operations are typical for a Python package setup. No malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is detected. The code’s structure and functions align with conventional setup scripts without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and standard setup script for the PyFunceble package. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs package configuration and dependency management securely and transparently.",
