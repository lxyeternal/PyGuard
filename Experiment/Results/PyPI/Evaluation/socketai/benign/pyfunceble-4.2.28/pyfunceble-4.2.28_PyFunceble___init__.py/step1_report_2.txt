{
  "purpose": "This module provides various utility functions for checking the syntax, availability, reputation, and maliciousness of domain names, IP addresses, URLs, and related subjects. It also offers helper functions for generating complements and verifying subject types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (e.g., 'subject') and uses imported classes (e.g., DomainSyntaxChecker, URLReputationChecker) which internally may fetch data from external sources or perform validations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted 'subject' data is processed and logged or sent over the network within imported modules. No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration are directly visible in this code.",
  "flows": "Input flows from function arguments into various checker class constructors; these classes perform syntax validation or reputation checks which may involve network calls or data processing. No direct data flows suggest malicious command execution or data exfiltration in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "All function implementations are straightforward wrappers around imported classes with warning messages indicating deprecation and future removal. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code mostly consists of warnings, class instantiations, and return statements.",
  "analysis": "The code functions primarily as an interface layer providing utility functions for domain, IP, URL validation, and reputation checks, leveraging external modules. There are no signs of malicious code or backdoors. All data flows involve standard validation or reputation checking processes. The warnings about deprecation are standard practice. No obfuscated code, hidden commands, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface layer for domain and IP validation and reputation checking. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its design is to delegate validation and reputation checks to external modules. No malware signals or security threats are evident.",
