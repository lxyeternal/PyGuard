  "purpose": "Configuration placeholders for database connection setup and project metadata documentation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static variable declarations and comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "None; variables are placeholders with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious contact string \"contactTATAfunilrysTODTODcom\" which appears obfuscated or placeholder, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable declarations initialized to None, accompanied by extensive documentation and licensing comments. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or executable logic. The contact string may be obfuscated or a placeholder but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration/documentation fragment with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are justified and align with the code's static, non-executable nature. No modifications are necessary.",
