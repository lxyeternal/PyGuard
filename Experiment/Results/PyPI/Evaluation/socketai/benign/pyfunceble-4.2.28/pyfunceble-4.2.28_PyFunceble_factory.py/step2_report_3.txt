  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scoring makes sense.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import and instantiation of a `Requester` object from the `PyFunceble.query.requests.requester` module.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n- No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code is evident in these snippets.\n- The license and author info are clearly stated, and the context suggests this is part of a larger, legitimate project.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only imports and creates an object. No issues are present.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overstate or misinterpret the code's intent.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (correct)\n  - `malware`: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n  - `securityRisk`: mostly 0, with one report at 0.1 (acceptable, considering the potential for network requests, but no actual risk is demonstrated)\n- The scores seem reasonable given the code snippet.\n\n**4. Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that the code is just setup code, not executing any network requests or malicious actions.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only minor point is the `securityRisk` of 0.1 in the second report, which is acceptable considering that instantiating a request object could, in some contexts, be used maliciously if misused elsewhere. However, in this isolated snippet, it's not justified to assign a higher risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommendation |\n|------------------|----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                    |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0                    |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the reports are accurate. No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code snippet alone does not pose any security threat. Any potential risk would depend on how the `Requester` object is used later in the application, which is not shown here.",
