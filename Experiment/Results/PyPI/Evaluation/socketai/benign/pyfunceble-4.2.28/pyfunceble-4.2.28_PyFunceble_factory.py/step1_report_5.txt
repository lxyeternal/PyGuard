{
  "purpose": "To initialize a Requester object for checking domain, IP, or URL availability or syntax.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Requester' class from 'PyFunceble.query.requests.requester' module, and instantiation of 'Requester' object.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaks occur; the code only imports and creates an object.",
  "flows": "Import of 'Requester' class -> instantiation of 'Requester' object with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code; simple import and object creation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a third-party library and creates an instance of it. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no network activity or data leaks observed. The code appears to be part of a larger system. The import is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing standard import and instantiation without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It is unlikely to pose any security threat.",
