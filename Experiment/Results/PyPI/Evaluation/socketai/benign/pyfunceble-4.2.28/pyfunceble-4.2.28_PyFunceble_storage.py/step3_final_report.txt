  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the PyFunceble project, including environment loading, constants, URLs, and data structures.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via dotenv, static URLs, constants, and the use of secrets.token_hex() for hostname generation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; configuration data is loaded and stored locally, no network or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and constants are loaded into global variables; hostname generated via secrets.token_hex() used in the configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of secrets.token_hex() to generate a dynamic hostname, which is unconventional but not malicious; redundant calls to get_config_directory().",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward configuration code with no malicious or obfuscated components. The use of secrets.token_hex() for hostname creation is unusual but benign. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. Repeated calls to get_config_directory() are redundant but not security issues. The URLs are standard GitHub raw links for data fetching. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and no malware threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The only minor concern is the unconventional hostname generation, which does not impact security. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the minor anomaly. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign intent.",
