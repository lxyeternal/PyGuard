  "purpose": "This code provides a customizable logging framework for the PyFunceble project, enabling logging to various outputs based on environment variables and configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PYFUNCEBLE_DEBUG_ON_SCREEN, DEBUG_PYFUNCEBLE_ON_SCREEN, PYFUNCEBLE_DEBUG, DEBUG_PYFUNCEBLE, PYFUNCEBLE_DEBUG_LVL, PYFUNCEBLE_LOGGING_LVL), configuration objects (PyFunceble.storage, PyFunceble.cli.storage), internal class attributes, and traceback information for origin tracking.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers that write to files or stream outputs, and potentially environment variables or configuration objects for control signals.",
  "flows": "Environment variable checks influence the activation and log levels; log methods generate log entries which are dispatched via handlers based on the current configuration and environment settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Usage of traceback to identify call origins is standard for logging purposes. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected. The code does access environment variables and configuration objects, but solely for logging behavior control.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a Logger class managing multiple loggers with dynamic activation based on environment variables and internal configuration. It uses standard Python logging practices, creating handlers, formatting, and log levels, with functions to initialize, destroy, and configure loggers. The environment variables are used to determine whether to log on screen or to files, and to set minimal logging levels. Traceback information is used to retrieve origin details for logs, which is typical in logging implementations. No suspicious or malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code strictly handles logging configuration and operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility designed for the PyFunceble project, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It primarily manages log output based on environment variables and internal settings. No malicious signals, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected.",
