{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the PyFunceble tool to handle specific error conditions such as general exceptions, no internet connection, and outdated software version.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it only defines classes and comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external data output, or resource access is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares exception classes and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code consists solely of class definitions and descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions for a Python project. It includes descriptive docstrings, author information, licensing, and project references, all typical for a well-documented open-source package. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. There are no data inputs, outputs, or behaviors that could lead to security risks or malware. The code does not perform any runtime actions, network operations, or data manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining exception classes for a Python project with extensive comments and metadata. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation. The code is benign and intended for error handling within the larger project.",
