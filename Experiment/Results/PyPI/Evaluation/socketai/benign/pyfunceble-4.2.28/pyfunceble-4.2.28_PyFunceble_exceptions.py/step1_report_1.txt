  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the PyFunceble tool, including handling for general exceptions, no internet connection, and outdated versions.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. All code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from the base Exception class. There are no functions, data manipulations, or external interactions. The comments and docstrings are standard and descriptive. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior are observed. The code serves a simple purpose of exception classification within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, minimal, and safe.",
