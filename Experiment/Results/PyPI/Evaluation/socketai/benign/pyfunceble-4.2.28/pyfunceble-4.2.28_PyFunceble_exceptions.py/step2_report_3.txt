  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- There are no functions, data manipulations, external interactions, or data flows.\n- The comments, docstrings, and metadata are standard and descriptive.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves a typical purpose within a larger project.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code content.\n- I agree with these assessments; no malware or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No external data, network activity, or potential attack vectors are present.\n\n**Scores for individual issues:**\n- The reports give a confidence of 1, indicating certainty that the code is safe.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is simple class definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n**Any discrepancies or points to challenge?**\n- None of the reports suggest any anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security concerns beyond the straightforward class definitions.\n- The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe, and benign set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I concur with the existing scores and reasoning.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores reflect the code's nature accurately.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
