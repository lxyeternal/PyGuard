  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - No external input, data processing, or network activity.\n   - No obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The code is a simple exception class hierarchy with no runtime logic, no external data handling, and no network interactions.\n   - No indication of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n   - Therefore, a `securityRisk` score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the actual content of the code.\n   - The detailed reasoning confirms the benign nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The high confidence scores match the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a minimal, well-documented, standard exception class definition with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The code is safe and poses no security risk.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exceptions, with scores correctly reflecting its benign nature.",
