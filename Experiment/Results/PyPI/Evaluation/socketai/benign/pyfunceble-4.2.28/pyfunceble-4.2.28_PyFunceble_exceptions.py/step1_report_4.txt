  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the PyFunceble tool to handle specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows; this is purely class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. It includes docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard exception class hierarchy for error handling within the PyFunceble project.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as custom exception definitions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
