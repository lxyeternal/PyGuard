  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining simple custom exception classes for the PyFunceble project.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external input/output, data processing, or runtime logic.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating the reviewers are certain of their assessments.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it only declares custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n- No evidence of code execution, data flow, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Flaws or errors:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are present in the code.\n- The documentation and comments are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n### Scores:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, as expected.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, correctly indicating no security issues.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there's no basis for assigning a high risk score.\n- All reports have a risk score of 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is minimal and safe.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**These scores are consistent with the code content and the reports' analysis.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, minimal implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within the PyFunceble project. It is benign, safe, and contains no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scoring and analysis are accurate and appropriate. No changes needed.",
