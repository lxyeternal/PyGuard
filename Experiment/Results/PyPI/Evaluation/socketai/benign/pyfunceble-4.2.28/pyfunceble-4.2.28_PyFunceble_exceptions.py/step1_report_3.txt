  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception to create custom exceptions. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or external calls. The comments and license information do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign implementation of custom exception classes for a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
