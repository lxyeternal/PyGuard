  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code solely defines custom exception classes with no external interactions, data processing, or malicious activity. There are no issues with the actual code content.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as error handling classes. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign a zero risk, and the code is simple class definitions without external dependencies or runtime behavior, raising the risk score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's content. No malicious activity or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content, which is straightforward.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is purely defining custom exception classes with comprehensive documentation and licensing info. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are correct.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and standard for error handling in a Python project. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
