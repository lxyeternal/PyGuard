  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception.\n- The code is purely declarative, with no data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behavior.\n- The comments, licensing, and metadata are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, safe, and typical for an open-source project.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or security risks.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The code is minimal and safe; no issues detected.\n- The high confidence scores (1 or 1.0) are justified given the straightforward nature and the detailed reasoning.\n\n**Any anomalies or assumptions?**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and with no security risk.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risks)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code segment is benign and typical for error handling in a Python project. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
