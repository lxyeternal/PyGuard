  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for the PyFunceble tool, including general, internet connection, and update-related errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and documentation comments without any data input points.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or output within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code solely contains class definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists of class definitions for exceptions with no suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains simple class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class, serving as custom exception types. It includes only documentation and licensing comments, with no runtime logic or data handling. There are no sources, sinks, or flows that could be exploited maliciously. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions, typical for a Python project, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and consists of custom exception classes with associated documentation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
