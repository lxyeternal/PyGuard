  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the PyFunceble project.",
  "sources": "No external input or data; class definitions are static and declarative.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class inheritance with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with appropriate docstrings and licensing info. It contains no external data input, network activity, or dynamic behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is minimal, standard, and benign, serving error handling purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content. Confidence levels are high (1), justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
