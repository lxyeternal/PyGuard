  "sources": "import statements, package_version check, wrapped function calls, class initializations, method calls, environment dependencies",
  "sinks": "start_as_current_span, process_request, process_response, wrap_function_wrapper",
  "flows": "Module import -> version check -> wrapper application -> traced method invocation -> span creation and attribute setting -> request/response processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up instrumentation for llama_index classes, wrapping their methods to add tracing spans. It uses standard open-telemetry tools and wrapt for method wrapping. No external data is handled insecurely; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The package version check adapts to different module versions, which is typical for maintaining compatibility. The use of context managers for spans and async support indicates proper tracing practices. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate instrumentation module for observability purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
