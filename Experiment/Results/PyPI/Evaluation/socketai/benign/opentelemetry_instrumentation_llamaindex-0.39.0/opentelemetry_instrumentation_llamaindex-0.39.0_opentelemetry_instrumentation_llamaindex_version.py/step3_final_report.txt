  "purpose": "The code declares a version string for a Python package, serving as a version identifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. It involves no input/output, data handling, or dynamic behavior. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and benign.",
