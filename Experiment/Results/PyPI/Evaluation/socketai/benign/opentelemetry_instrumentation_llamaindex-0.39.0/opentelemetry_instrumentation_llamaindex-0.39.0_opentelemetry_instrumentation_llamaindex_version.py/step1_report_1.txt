  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only version declaration, no anomalies or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data handling, or execution flows that could indicate malicious behavior. The code is standard for Python packages to declare their version, and contains no hidden or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
