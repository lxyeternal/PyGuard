  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external data handling.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No report indicates any signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or dynamic behavior that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which aligns with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - Confidence is 1 across all reports, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The reasoning that this is a standard version declaration with no security concern is sound.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code snippet is a typical version declaration in Python packages.\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Remain at 0.\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward version string assignment.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
