  "purpose": "Instrumentation of llama_index.query_engine.retriever_query_engine for tracing and observability using OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check, and method wrappers around 'query' and 'aquery' functions.",
  "sinks": "Wrapped functions that create tracing spans, set attributes, and process request/response data.",
  "flows": "Source code imports and version check lead to wrapping of specific class methods, which then create spans and set attributes during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard runtime instrumentation for tracing llama_index query engine functions. It conditionally wraps methods based on package version, uses well-known libraries for span creation, and manages both sync and async functions appropriately. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The purpose is purely for observability, with no network or data exfiltration activities. The code aligns with typical monitoring practices and contains no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, benign instrumentation for tracing purposes. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score is zero. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use.",
