{
  "purpose": "Define a simple configuration class with a placeholder for an exception logger",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points where data could be leaked or manipulated",
  "flows": "No data flow present in the code",
  "anomalies": "Use of a class attribute set to None without further context; no apparent malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Config' with a single class attribute 'exception_logger' initialized to None. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior such as data leakage, malicious code, or external connections. The code is minimal and appears to be a placeholder or configuration setting, which by itself does not indicate any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a configuration placeholder and contains no security risks.",
