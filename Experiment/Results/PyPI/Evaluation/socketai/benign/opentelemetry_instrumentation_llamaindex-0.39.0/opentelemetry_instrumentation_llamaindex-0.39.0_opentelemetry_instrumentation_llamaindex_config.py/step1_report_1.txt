{
  "purpose": "Defines a class 'Config' with a class variable 'exception_logger' initialized to None.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a value to a class variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present that could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only contains a class definition with a static variable.",
  "anomalies": "The class contains only a single variable initialized to None, which is not inherently suspicious or unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal class with a class variable set to None. There are no functions, no input handling, and no dynamic behavior. This appears to be a placeholder or configuration container. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code does not perform any operations or data manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward class definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'exception_logger' might be configured later.",
