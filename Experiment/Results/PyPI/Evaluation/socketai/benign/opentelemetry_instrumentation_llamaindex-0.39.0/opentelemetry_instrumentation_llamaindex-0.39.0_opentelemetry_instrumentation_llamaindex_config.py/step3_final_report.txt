  "purpose": "A minimal class definition serving as a configuration placeholder with a class variable set to None.",
  "sources": "Class declaration and class variable assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Config' with a single class variable 'exception_logger' initialized to None. It contains no functions, data processing, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign and minimal nature of this code. The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code appears to be a simple configuration container, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
