{
  "purpose": "Instrumentation setup for LlamaIndex SDK using OpenTelemetry, applying different instrumentors based on version.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check via import_version(\"llama-index\"), and conditional instrumentation calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "Version check source (import_version) to conditional instrumentation functions (instrument_with_dispatcher or individual instrumentors).",
  "anomalies": "Use of string comparison for semantic versioning check (>= \"0.10.20\") instead of proper semantic version parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK instrumentation class that conditionally applies instrumentation based on the version of llama-index. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only technical flaw is the version comparison method, which uses string comparison, potentially leading to incorrect behavior but not security risks. No data leaks, network activity, or code injection are detected. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with typical instrumentation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only issue is the version comparison method, which should be replaced with semantic version parsing for correctness. The current security risk is minimal (~0.1), and malware score is 0.",
