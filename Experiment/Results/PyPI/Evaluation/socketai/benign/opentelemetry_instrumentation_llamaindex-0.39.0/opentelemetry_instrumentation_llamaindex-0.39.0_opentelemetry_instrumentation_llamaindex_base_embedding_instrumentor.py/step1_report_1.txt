  "purpose": "Instrumenting the 'llama_index' package's embedding functions for tracing purposes using OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function wrappers that read package versions and wrap target functions for tracing.",
  "sinks": "Function wrapping that intercepts calls to 'get_query_embedding' and 'aget_query_embedding' methods, attaching tracing spans.",
  "flows": "Source: package_version check and function import -> sink: function wrappers intercept 'get_query_embedding' calls -> tracer starts span -> original functions are called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation present. Use of dynamic wrapping for tracing appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically wraps specific methods ('get_query_embedding' and its async variant) in 'llama_index' modules for tracing with OpenTelemetry. It checks for package version to determine which module to instrument, then uses 'wrap_function_wrapper' to insert tracing spans around these methods. The span attributes are set for trace kind and entity name. No suspicious or malicious activity detected; the code is standard instrumentation code. No obfuscated or malicious code, no suspicious data leaks or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard tracing instrumentation for 'llama_index' embedding functions. It dynamically instruments methods for performance and monitoring purposes without any malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
