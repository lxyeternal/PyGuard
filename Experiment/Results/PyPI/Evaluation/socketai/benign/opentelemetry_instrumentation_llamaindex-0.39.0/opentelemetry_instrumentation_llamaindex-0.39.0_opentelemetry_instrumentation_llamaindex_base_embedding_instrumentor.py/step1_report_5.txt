  "purpose": "Instrument OpenTelemetry tracing for llama_index.embedding's get_query_embedding methods",
  "sources": "Import statements, package_version checks, function wrappers, tracer method calls",
  "stores": "Attributes set on spans such as span kind and entity name",
  "flows": "Function call wrapped with tracing spans, including both sync and async methods",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of dynamic wrapping for instrumentation, which is common in monitoring tools",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic instrumentation of specific methods in the llama_index.embeddings module, adding tracing spans for monitoring purposes. It conditionally instruments different module versions based on the presence of 'llama-index-core'. The wrappers add tracing attributes, but do not process or leak data directly. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard instrumentation code for monitoring, with no signs of malicious behavior. It dynamically wraps functions to add tracing spans, which is typical for observability purposes. No security risks or malware indications identified.",
