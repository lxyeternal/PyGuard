  "purpose": "The code aims to instrument specific methods of the llama_index library to add tracing spans for monitoring and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Import statements for package versioning and tracing utilities, module name strings, and wrapped function calls.",
  "sinks": "Wrapped functions that execute within tracing spans, potentially capturing data passed to 'get_query_embedding' and its async counterpart.",
  "flows": "Module import and version check -> Instrumentation setup -> Wrapping of targeted functions -> Execution of wrapped functions within tracing spans.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Usage of standard tracing wrappers and version checks appears legitimate. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation. The code structure is typical for instrumentation modules.",
  "analysis": "The script performs conditional module instrumentation based on package version detection, then wraps specified class methods to include tracing spans. It uses safe practices for tracing, and no external data leaks, insecure code, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'wrap_function_wrapper' and trace spans aligns with standard observability practices. No anomalies or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate instrumentation tool for monitoring llama_index library functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only potential concern is the exposure of data via tracing spans, which is standard in observability but should be managed properly. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for diagnostic purposes.",
