  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup utility for a Python package with C extension support, including fallback mechanisms. It reads version info, manages build args, handles errors gracefully.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** No signs of malicious code, network activity, or data leaks. The code is straightforward, with standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.95).  \n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment variables, build configuration, and error handling. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — perhaps slightly conservative, but acceptable given the environment variable influence.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9).  \n**Verdict:** The code is standard, with no malicious intent. Slightly cautious risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script with environment-based configuration, error handling, and version reading.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9).  \n**Verdict:** No malicious activity, standard setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis, emphasizing the configuration, environment variables, and fallback mechanisms.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** No signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9).  \n**Verdict:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard setup script, environment variables, error handling.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — very low, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** Very high (0.95).  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code performs setup and build configuration without any malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting that environment variables influence build behavior, which is typical but can be misused if environment variables are maliciously set. However, in the context of a setup script, this is standard.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package with optional C extension support.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code is present.\n- The environment variable influences are typical for build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The fallback mechanisms and error handling are standard and safe.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to environment variable influence but no actual malicious behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall security posture of this code is very high. It is a legitimate setup script with no signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
