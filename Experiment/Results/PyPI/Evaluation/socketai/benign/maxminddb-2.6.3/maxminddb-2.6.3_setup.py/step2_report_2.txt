  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, potential risks, and whether the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup process with fallback mechanisms, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a typical setup script, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The fallback logic for build failures is standard practice. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or malicious code are present.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe scoring seems appropriate. The high confidence (0.95) is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build configuration, environment variables, and error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report notes the potential influence of environment variables but correctly states that they are used for configuration, not malicious purposes. The risk score of 0.2 is slightly elevated but still low, reflecting minimal concern over environment variable manipulation.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe scores are reasonable. The malware score remains 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The risk score is slightly higher but justified due to environment variable influence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with emphasis on standard setup procedures and error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The risk score remains low, reflecting typical build script concerns.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment variables influencing build configuration, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The script’s reliance on environment variables is standard, and no malicious intent is apparent. The risk score remains low.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing safe build configuration and error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. The minimal risk score reflects the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, given the reliance on environment variables and error handling, but these are standard practices in build scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — accurate.\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of the code, a low risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is appropriate. No significant security concerns are present.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — The code is standard, with minimal environment influence, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical setup script with fallback mechanisms, no malicious or obfuscated elements, and negligible security risks.",
