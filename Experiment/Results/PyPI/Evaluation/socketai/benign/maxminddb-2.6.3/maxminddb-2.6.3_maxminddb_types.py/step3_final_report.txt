{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and subclasses for representing database records in the maxminddb library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static type definitions and class subclassing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only establishes data structures without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type aliasing and subclassing with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, defining type aliases (Primitive, Record) and subclasses (RecordList, RecordDict) for database record representations. It imports only standard typing modules, with no functions, data handling, or external interactions. The classes are simple subclasses of list and dict, serving as type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious, purely structural module for type annotations. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
