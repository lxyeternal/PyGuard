{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and custom list/dict subclasses for representing database records in the maxminddb module.",
  "sources": "The module imports 'AnyStr', 'Dict', 'List', 'Union' from 'typing'. No external data input sources are present within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, network operations, or external system interactions in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines types and classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining custom types with no apparent malicious or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases and subclasses for list and dict to represent database records. It imports typing constructs to enforce type hints. No data input, output, or processing logic is included. The classes are simple subclasses without additional methods or behaviors. No signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities, only structural type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a clean, safe module defining type annotations and subclasses for record structures in a database context. It does not contain malicious code, security risks, or obfuscated elements.",
