  "purpose": "Define types for representing database records, including primitive values, lists, and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and class inheritance do not involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type annotations and class inheritance is straightforward; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases and class definitions to structure database records. It uses standard Python typing and class inheritance. There are no input reading, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. No code executes external commands or accesses environment variables. The classes are simple extensions of list and dict for type clarity. Overall, this is a benign code snippet primarily for type annotation and data structure definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign type definition module for database record structures. There are no malicious behaviors, no data leaks, and no suspicious code. It serves as a type hinting aid without any operational logic that could pose security risks.",
