{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and data structures for database record representation, specifically for MaxMind DB records.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads; type annotations and class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output; no functions or methods that process data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow operations present; only type definitions and class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases and simple class subclasses for list and dict types used in database records. There are no runtime data operations, no input/output handling, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be purely definitional, serving as a type system or data model without any malicious logic or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward type and class declaration for representing database records, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any operations beyond static type annotations.",
