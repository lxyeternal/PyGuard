{
  "purpose": "This module defines type aliases and subclasses for representing database records in the maxminddb library, specifically for handling data records as primitives, lists, or dictionaries.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit data input sources; the code only defines types and classes without input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where data is sent, output, or potentially leaked; the code does not perform I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists within this code; it only establishes type definitions and class subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for handling database records using type aliases and subclasses of List and Dict. These are purely structural and do not involve any input/output, network communication, or data manipulation logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation, are evident. The code serves as type annotations and container subclasses for clarity and type safety in other parts of the application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structural module for type annotations and custom container subclasses in the maxminddb library. It contains no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
