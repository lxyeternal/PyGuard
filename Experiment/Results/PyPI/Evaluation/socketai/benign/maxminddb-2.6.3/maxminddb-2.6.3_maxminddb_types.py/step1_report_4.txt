  "purpose": "Define types for representing database records with primitive, list, and dictionary structures.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources are present.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or output points; no untrusted data processing is performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources or sensitive sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; the code consists solely of type definitions and class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing modules and defines type aliases and subclasses for list and dict structures used in database records. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The classes are simple, with no executable logic, and serve purely as type annotations or structural definitions. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward, clean type definition module for use in larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign type definition module with no malicious intent or security risks. It provides structural types for database records but does not include any code that could be exploited or that performs any harmful actions.",
