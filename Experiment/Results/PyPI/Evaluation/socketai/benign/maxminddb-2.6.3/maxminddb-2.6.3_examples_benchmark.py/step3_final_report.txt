  "purpose": "Benchmark maxminddb lookup performance using randomly generated IP addresses.",
  "sources": "Random IP generation via random.getrandbits(32), reading from maxminddb database with reader.get()",
  "sinks": "reader.get() acts as a read-only lookup; no untrusted data sink leading to data leak or external effect",
  "flows": "Generated IPs flow from random.getrandbits(32) to socket.inet_ntoa, then to reader.get()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; fixed seed for reproducibility is benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward benchmarking script generating pseudo-random IPs with a fixed seed, performing lookups in a local database, and measuring throughput. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, no malicious payloads, and no obfuscation are present. The use of standard modules and practices indicates benign intent. The fixed seed ensures reproducibility but does not introduce security risks. The reader.get() method is a safe, read-only operation in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign benchmarking utility with no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score are appropriate and justified.",
