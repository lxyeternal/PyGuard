  "purpose": "The script benchmarks the performance of the maxminddb library for IP address lookups using randomly generated IPs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--count, --mode, --file), and generates random IP addresses using random.getrandbits.",
  "sinks": "Uses maxminddb to perform database lookups with the generated IP addresses.",
  "flows": "Generates random IPs -> converts them to string IP addresses -> performs database lookup with maxminddb.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code behavior. Random IP generation appears solely for benchmarking purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an argument parser, initializes a maxminddb database, and performs a large number of IP address lookups for benchmarking. IP addresses are randomly generated using random.getrandbits and converted to string format for lookup. No user input is directly used in lookup operations, and no data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The use of maxminddb is typical for geolocation lookups. The code appears straightforward and intended for benchmarking.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign benchmarking tool that generates random IP addresses to test maxminddb lookup performance. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are detected.",
