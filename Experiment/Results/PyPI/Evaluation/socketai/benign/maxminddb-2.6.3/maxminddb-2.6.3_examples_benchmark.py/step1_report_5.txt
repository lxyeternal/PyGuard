  "purpose": "Benchmark the performance of MaxMindDB lookups using randomly generated IP addresses.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for configuration and generates random IP addresses using random.getrandbits.",
  "sinks": "Calls reader.get() with generated IP addresses; outputs performance metrics.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> random IP generation -> maxminddb reader.get() -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of maxminddb appears standard for geolocation lookups.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an argument parser, seeds the random number generator, opens a MaxMind database, and performs a specified number of IP address lookups using randomly generated IPs. The process is solely for benchmarking performance and does not include any malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious control flow. No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The IPs are generated locally, and the database access appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a performance benchmarking tool for MaxMindDB lookups, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a legitimate utility script for performance measurement.",
