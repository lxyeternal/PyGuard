  "purpose": "Define custom error class for MaxMind DB reader to handle invalid database data",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this code",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a custom exception class inheriting from RuntimeError, used for signaling invalid database data. It contains a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no input, output, or data processing activities, nor any complex or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module defining an error class with no malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or problematic.",
