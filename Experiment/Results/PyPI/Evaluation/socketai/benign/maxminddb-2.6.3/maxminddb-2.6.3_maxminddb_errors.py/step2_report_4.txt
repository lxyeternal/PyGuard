  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal class definition for `InvalidDatabaseError` inheriting from `RuntimeError`.\n   - It contains only a docstring and no executable logic, input/output, or data processing.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition used for error handling.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no external data, no logic, and no malicious intent, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond the code's actual scope.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, harmless class definition for an exception.**  \nThere are no security concerns, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a benign, straightforward class definition with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and no score adjustments are necessary.",
