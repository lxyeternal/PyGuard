  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code solely defines a custom exception class inheriting from RuntimeError.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The class serves as a specific error indicator for invalid database data.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or overlooked issues are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct; no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware Score (0):** Correct; the code contains no malicious logic.\n   - **Security Risk Score (0):** Correct; the code is purely for error handling with no security implications.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is a minimal, straightforward class definition with no suspicious activity, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature and correctness of the code.\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign class definition for custom error handling.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and appropriate.\n- No further action or adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided. The code poses no security concerns.",
