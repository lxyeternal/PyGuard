  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code defines a single class `InvalidDatabaseError` inheriting from `RuntimeError`.\n   - It contains only a docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Maliciousness and Anomalies:**\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or network operations.\n   - The class is used for signaling specific errors related to database integrity, which is a common practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Errors in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a benign, straightforward class definition with no security concerns.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or risks that are unsupported by the code.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign module for error handling.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n   - No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a simple, safe, and typical pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious intent, and is free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
