  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal, straightforward class definition for an exception inheriting from RuntimeError.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and serves a simple error-handling purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign, with no security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code is simple and safe is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence is 1, reflecting certainty based on the simplicity of the code.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining an exception class with no external interactions, no data flow, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' assigned scores of 0 align with this assessment.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0      |\n| Security Risk   | 0      |\n\nThis code is a standard, safe, and non-problematic module defining a custom exception class for database errors.",
