  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python module defining a single custom exception class `InvalidDatabaseError` inheriting from `RuntimeError`.\n   - The class has a descriptive docstring indicating it is used when unexpected data is found in the MaxMind database.\n   - There are no data processing, input/output operations, external data sources, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - The code is purely a class definition with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any hardcoded secrets.\n   - The class is intended for error signaling within a larger application context, not for malicious purposes.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malware or malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — The code does not introduce any security risk; it is a benign error class.\n\n4. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a simple, benign class definition.\n   - They uniformly assign confidence = 1, obfuscated = 0, malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes:**\n   - Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n   - The reports' conclusions are appropriate.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only defining an exception class, any security concern would stem from its usage elsewhere, not from this snippet itself.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign module for error handling.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that this code is purely a simple, safe class definition with no security implications.",
