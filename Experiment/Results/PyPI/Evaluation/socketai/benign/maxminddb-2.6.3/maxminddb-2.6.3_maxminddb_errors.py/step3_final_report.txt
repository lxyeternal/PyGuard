  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for signaling invalid database data in the MaxMind DB reader module.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definition only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class used solely for error signaling within larger application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from RuntimeError with a descriptive docstring. It contains no input/output, external calls, or complex logic. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The class serves as a benign error indicator for database issues. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security concerns or malicious intent. It poses no threat and is appropriate for error handling in the context of MaxMind database operations.",
