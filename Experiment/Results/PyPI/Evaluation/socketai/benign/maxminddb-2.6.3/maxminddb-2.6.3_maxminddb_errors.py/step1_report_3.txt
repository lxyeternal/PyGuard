  "purpose": "Define custom error class for MaxMind DB reader to handle unexpected database data",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; there are no output or data leak points",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition with no suspicious or unusual features",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple module comment and a class definition for handling database errors. There are no functions, data processing, or external input/output operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are present. The class inherits from RuntimeError and serves a standard error handling purpose. Given its simplicity, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining a custom exception class for database errors. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and presents no security risks.",
