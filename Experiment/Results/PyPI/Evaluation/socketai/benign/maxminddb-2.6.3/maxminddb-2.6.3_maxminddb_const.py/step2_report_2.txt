  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of constant definitions for different modes, with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic.\n   - There are no signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign and serve as straightforward constants.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code is purely constant definitions with no malicious behavior, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.5 (if any) are appropriate.\n   - The reports correctly assign a `securityRisk` of 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code content.\n\n**Summary of My Own Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a straightforward constants module, serving as configuration flags.\n- No dynamic, obfuscated, or malicious elements are present.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code poses no security risk, malware concern, or obfuscation issue.",
