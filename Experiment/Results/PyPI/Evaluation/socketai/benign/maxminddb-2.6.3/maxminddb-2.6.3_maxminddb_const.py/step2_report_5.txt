  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains constant definitions for API modes.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic behavior, data processing, or external input/output.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign and serve as configuration constants.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk since there's no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n   - This is correct; the code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the simplicity of the code.\n   - No overreach is observed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the nature of the code, I agree with the assessments. It is a straightforward constants module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
