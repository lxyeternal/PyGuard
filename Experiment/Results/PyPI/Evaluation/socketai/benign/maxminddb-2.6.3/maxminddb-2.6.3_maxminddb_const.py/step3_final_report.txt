  "purpose": "Constants used in the API for mode selection and configuration.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions assigned directly to variables.",
  "sinks": "No data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as static configuration flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant assignments with no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of integer constant definitions representing different modes. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The code is clear, simple, and serves as configuration flags. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
