  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is solely defining constants with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or obfuscation. The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that there are no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- They do not mention any potential for misuse if these constants are used improperly elsewhere, but given the simplicity, this is unlikely.  \n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- `obfuscated: 0` is correct; no obfuscation is present.  \n- `securityRisk: 0` is justified; no security issues are apparent.  \n- The confidence score of 1 across all reports is reasonable, given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since all reports conclude zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, raising the risk score would be unjustified.  \n- The code is a simple constants module with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- The malware score is correctly 0 in all reports.  \n- No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is just constant definitions with no suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe code is a benign constants module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Own Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk associated with static constants)  \n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code itself is harmless, it's always important to consider how these constants are used in the larger application. If used improperly, they could contribute to misconfiguration, but based solely on this snippet, there's no security concern.",
