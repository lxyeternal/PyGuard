  "purpose": "Define constants for different API modes used in the application",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading present in this snippet)",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or output actions)",
  "flows": "No data flow detected as there are only constant definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant variable assignments, defining mode identifiers with integer values. No input handling, data processing, or external interaction occurs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic. The constants suggest different operational modes for an API but are harmless by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless set of constant definitions used for configuration or mode selection. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
