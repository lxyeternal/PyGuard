  "purpose": "Define constants used in the API for different modes of operation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines constants without reading input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions for various modes, represented as integer values. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations. The constants likely serve as configuration options within a larger application. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of mode constants with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain any anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
