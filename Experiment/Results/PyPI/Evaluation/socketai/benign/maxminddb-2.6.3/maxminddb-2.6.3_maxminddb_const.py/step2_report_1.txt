  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward set of constant definitions.\n   - No dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious payloads are indicated.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is simple constant assignments; no errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that these constants are likely used for API configuration or mode selection.\n   - No logical mistakes or security flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis; the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is just constant definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior, setting `malware` and `securityRisk` to 0 is appropriate.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, reflecting no obfuscation.\n   - The `confidence` score of 1 is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly avoid assumptions.\n   - No need to challenge any claims, as none suggest vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign constants module.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis is a straightforward, safe constants definition with no security concerns.",
