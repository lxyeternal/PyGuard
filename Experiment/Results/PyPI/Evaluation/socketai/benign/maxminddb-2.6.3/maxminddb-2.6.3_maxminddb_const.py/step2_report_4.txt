  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is just a set of constant definitions, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious code, data flow, or external dependencies. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of suspicious elements. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity or payloads are indicated.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, no vulnerabilities or security concerns are apparent.\n\nSince the reports uniformly assign the lowest scores, and these are justified by the simplicity and benign nature of the code, **no adjustments are necessary**.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no concern.  \n- Given the code's nature, there's no reason to elevate the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- No suspicious or malicious activity is implied or detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless constants.  \n- No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious intent are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- All scores are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward constants module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis, confirming the code's benign nature.",
