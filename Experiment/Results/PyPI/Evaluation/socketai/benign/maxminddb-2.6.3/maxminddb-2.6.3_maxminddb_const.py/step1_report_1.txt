{
  "purpose": "Define constants used in an API, likely for different operational modes or configurations.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads; constants are hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; constants are standalone assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward constant definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of constant definitions representing various mode identifiers, assigned to integer values. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be a typical constants module intended for internal use within an API or library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a set of constants for API modes and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
