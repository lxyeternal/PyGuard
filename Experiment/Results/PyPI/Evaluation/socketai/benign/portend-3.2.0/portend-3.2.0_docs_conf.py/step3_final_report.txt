  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation, setting extensions, link patterns, and build options.",
  "sources": "Extension lists, regex patterns in link_files, configuration variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; static patterns used only for documentation link replacement",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with standard regex patterns and extension lists",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration script with extension lists, regex patterns for link replacements, and mapping configurations. It does not process user input, perform network activity, or execute dynamic code. The regex patterns are static and used solely for documentation link generation. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are present. The structure and content are typical for such configuration files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
