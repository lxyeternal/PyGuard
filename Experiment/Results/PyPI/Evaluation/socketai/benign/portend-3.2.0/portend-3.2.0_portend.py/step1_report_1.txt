{
  "purpose": "Library for managing port availability, including checking if ports are free or occupied, and finding free local ports.",
  "sources": "User input via command line (host:port), parameters passed to functions such as host, port, timeout, and potentially data from socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Socket connections and bindings, raising exceptions, printing to stderr, and potentially network-related operations. No direct data leakage or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources (host, port, timeout) are used in functions like assert_free, occupied, and _main, which invoke socket operations and command execution; no evident malicious data flow or exfiltration paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Code appears to perform standard port management functions with no obfuscated or misleading constructs. Uses platform-specific client_host adjustments, which are typical for network checks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides port checking utilities, including asserting if a port is free or occupied, and finding available local ports. It uses socket connections to verify port status, raises specific exceptions, and includes command-line interface support. All socket operations are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent. No suspicious network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears well-structured and intended for legitimate port management tasks without malicious payloads or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard port management library with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs legitimate network checks and port operations securely. No malicious signals or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
