  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard port checking via socket, user input, socket info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Socket connections, exception raising, no malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no backdoors, standard network checks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code performs legitimate port management functions with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard socket operations and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 align with the benign nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on port checking, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights standard socket use, no suspicious code, mentions dynamic invocation via `globals()` as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Fully confirms benign port management functions, no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign low risk (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the benign functionality.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or behavior).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, well-structured code).\n- **Security risk score:** Given the functions are port checks and socket operations, the risk is minimal. Even with dynamic invocation via `globals()`, it doesn't inherently pose a security threat in this context.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard port management library with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and there are no signs of supply chain compromise or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score (~0.1-0.2). No further action needed based on the provided code and reports.",
