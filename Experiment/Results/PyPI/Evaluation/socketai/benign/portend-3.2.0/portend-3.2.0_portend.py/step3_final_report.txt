  "purpose": "Port management utility functions for checking port availability, occupancy, and parsing host/port pairs.",
  "sources": "Socket operations (getaddrinfo, connect, bind), user input via command-line arguments, environment variables (indirectly through socket info).",
  "sinks": "Socket connect and bind calls, exception raising for port status, dynamic function invocation via globals().",
  "flows": "Input from user or environment → socket info retrieval or connection attempts → exception handling or success signals → command-line function execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'globals()' for dynamic function lookup in __main__, but within controlled CLI context, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard socket-based port checks, waits for ports to become free or occupied, and parses host/port pairs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The dynamic invocation via 'globals()' is a common pattern for CLI dispatching, not inherently malicious. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with legitimate network utility functions. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or sabotage signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, legitimate port management library with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified based on the code's functionality and structure.",
