  "flows": "Generate address info -> create socket -> bind/listen -> check port status via portend functions",
  "anomalies": "None suspicious; standard socket testing code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for local socket port checks, involving socket creation, binding, listening, and port status assertions. No external data sources or malicious behaviors are present. The use of portend functions is appropriate for port availability testing. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code operates solely on localhost interfaces, and all tests are within a controlled environment. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured socket port testing suite with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the scores are appropriate. The slight elevation in security risk in one report (0.2) is justifiable but does not indicate actual threat. Overall, the code poses no security concern.",
