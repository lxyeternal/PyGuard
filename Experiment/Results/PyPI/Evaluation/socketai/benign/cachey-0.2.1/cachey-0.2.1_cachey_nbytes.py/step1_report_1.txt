{
  "purpose": "The code calculates the memory size in bytes of various Python objects, including pandas Series, DataFrames, and numpy arrays.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through object attributes such as _data, index, and external function calls like sys.getsizeof.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.getsizeof to determine object sizes; no external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through attribute access and functions, then to size calculations; no external data flows or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes deep access to pandas internals like _data.blocks and index._data, which might be considered unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to measure object sizes, handling pandas Series, DataFrames, numpy arrays, and generic objects. It leverages pandas internals for precise sizing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are present. The usage of sys.getsizeof and internal pandas attributes is standard for advanced memory profiling. The code appears to serve an analytical purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs memory size calculations for data analysis purposes and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard Python and pandas features without obfuscation or malicious logic.",
