{
  "purpose": "The code calculates the memory size in bytes of various Python objects, specifically handling pandas Series, DataFrames, and numpy arrays.",
  "sources": "Data is read from object attributes such as o._data, o.index._data, and attributes like o.nbytes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include sys.getsizeof and o.nbytes, which reveal object memory sizes, possibly exposing internal data structure sizes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object attributes (such as _data and index._data) through functions that calculate their sizes, with no untrusted input processed explicitly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Use of sys.getsizeof and attribute access on pandas/numpy objects is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for size calculation, including handling pandas Series/DataFrames and numpy arrays. It checks object types via module and class names, then computes size via _array or nbytes. No external inputs are processed, and no data is sent over networks. The attribute access appears typical for pandas/numpy objects. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code seems to be designed solely for internal size measurement of data objects.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate memory size calculations for pandas and numpy objects. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it leak sensitive data or perform any harmful actions. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
