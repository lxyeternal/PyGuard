{
  "purpose": "The code calculates the memory size in bytes of various objects, including pandas Series, DataFrames, numpy arrays, and generic objects.",
  "sources": "Data accessed from pandas Series and DataFrame objects (_data.blocks, index._data), numpy arrays (o), and generic objects with nbytes attribute.",
  "sinks": "sys.getsizeof() calls, which compute and return the size of objects, potentially revealing sensitive data sizes.",
  "flows": "Input data from pandas or numpy objects flows into size calculation functions, which then call sys.getsizeof() or internal _array functions to compute sizes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior such as hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code. Usage of sys.getsizeof() on objects is standard and intended for size estimation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to compute the size of objects in memory, supporting pandas Series, DataFrames, numpy arrays, and generic objects. It utilizes sys.getsizeof() and custom logic for pandas and numpy data structures. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be a utility for size measurement, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a benign purpose of measuring object sizes. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of sys.getsizeof() and pandas/numpy attributes is standard for this kind of utility.",
