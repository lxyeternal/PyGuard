  "purpose": "Calculate memory size in bytes for pandas Series, DataFrames, numpy arrays, and general objects.",
  "sources": "Accesses pandas internals (_data.blocks, index._data), uses sys.getsizeof() and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal attribute access for size estimation.",
  "flows": "Reads object internals and calls sys.getsizeof() to sum sizes.",
  "anomalies": "Deep pandas internals access, which is advanced but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a memory profiling utility that calculates object sizes by accessing pandas internals and numpy arrays. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or execute malicious code. The use of sys.getsizeof() and internal pandas attributes could leak size information but is typical for profiling tools. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (0.1), reflecting potential information leakage but not a security threat. The code's purpose is transparent and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign memory profiling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified by the potential for size information leakage, which is typical in profiling tools but not harmful.",
