{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to calculate the number of bytes occupied by various data objects, including pandas Series, DataFrames, numpy arrays, and general Python objects.",
  "sources": "Reads include input data objects passed to the nbytes() function, such as pandas Series/DataFrames, numpy arrays, and other objects with an 'nbytes' attribute or that are standard Python objects.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the sys.getsizeof() function, which estimates object size, and the custom functions _array() and nbytes() which process data objects to determine their memory footprint.",
  "flows": "Input objects are processed through type checks and attribute inspections; data from pandas or numpy objects flows through _array() functions to calculate size; the size information propagates back to the nbytes() function for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hidden code, obfuscated code, or backdoors, are detected. The code uses standard library functions for size estimation without executing untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions to compute the memory size of objects. It processes pandas Series and DataFrame objects specifically by accessing internal attributes. The use of sys.getsizeof() is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. It appears to be a utility module for memory measurement. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data flows, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for calculating object memory sizes in Python, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It utilizes standard libraries and practices for size estimation without any suspicious behavior.",
