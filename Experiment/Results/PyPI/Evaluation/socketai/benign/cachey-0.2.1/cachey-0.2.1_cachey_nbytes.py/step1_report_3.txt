{
  "purpose": "Calculate the memory size in bytes of various objects, including pandas Series, DataFrames, numpy arrays, and generic Python objects.",
  "sources": "Input data includes objects passed to the nbytes() function, such as pandas Series, DataFrames, numpy arrays, and other objects.",
  "sinks": "The function uses sys.getsizeof and object attributes (like nbytes), which are generally safe; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow through type checks and attribute accesses, with no external data or untrusted sources involved; the code mainly reads object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to calculate the memory size of objects, specifically handling pandas Series and DataFrames by summing their internal data blocks and index. It leverages standard library functions like sys.getsizeof and object attributes like nbytes. The logic is straightforward, focusing on memory measurement rather than data manipulation or external communication. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a utility for size estimation with proper type handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for measuring object sizes in memory, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles pandas and numpy objects securely without exposing sensitive data or external interfaces.",
