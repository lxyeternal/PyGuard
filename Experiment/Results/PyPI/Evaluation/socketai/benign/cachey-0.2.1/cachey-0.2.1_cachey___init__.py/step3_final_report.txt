{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file, importing components from local modules and defining a version string.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.score, .cache, .nbytes) and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not handle data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements and a version string, typical for a package's __init__.py. No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The overall assessment indicates no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports and scores are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
