{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports classes or functions from other modules for scoring, caching, and byte size calculations, and defines a version string, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .score, .cache, .nbytes; reads the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or output; imports and version assignment are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements and version assignment with no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules and a version string declaration. There are no function calls, data handling, or suspicious patterns. The structure is typical for a Python package module, likely an __init__.py file. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a Python package's initialization or configuration module. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
