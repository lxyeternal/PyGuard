{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import statement and version declaration, likely part of a larger Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .score, .cache, .nbytes",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, no use of untrusted input, no data leak points, no external network or file operations",
  "flows": "Imports are static references; no runtime data flow or untrusted input processing visible",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import statements and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from local modules and a version string. No dynamic execution, no user input handling, no network calls, no hardcoded secrets. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file. No suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements and a version declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
