  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The original code is a straightforward set of import statements from local modules and a version string assignment. All reports confirm this, noting the absence of functions, data handling, or external interactions.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard for a Python package's __init__.py or configuration module, with no suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since all reports and the code indicate no malicious or suspicious activity, risk scores should remain at 0.  \n   **No justification exists for higher scores.**\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All claims are based on straightforward static analysis of import statements and version declaration. No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports**  \n   The scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity detected; static import statements only             |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns observed                         |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified                 |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and poses no security threat.",
