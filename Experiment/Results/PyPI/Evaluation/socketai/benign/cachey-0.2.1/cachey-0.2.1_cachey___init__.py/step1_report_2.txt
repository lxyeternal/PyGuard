{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module that imports specific classes or functions ('Scorer', 'Cache', 'nbytes') from other local modules, and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules: .score, .cache, and .nbytes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this snippet, as it only contains import statements and a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with straightforward import statements and a version declaration. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from local modules, likely for internal use in a larger package. The version string indicates package versioning. There is no evident malicious behavior, data handling, or suspicious activity. The structure is typical for a Python package's module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting of import statements and a version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
