  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only module imports and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports three modules from the local package and sets a version string. There are no functions, data handling, or network activity. The imports suggest modular design, but do not indicate malicious behavior. The version string appears standard and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting solely of module imports and version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.",
