  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - The code consists solely of import statements from local modules (`.score`, `.cache`, `.nbytes`) and a version string assignment.\n   - No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module setup file for a Python package.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify the absence of untrusted data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n   - The code's simplicity and static nature support the benign assessment.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code content.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely import statements and a version string, the risk scores should remain low.\n   - No reason exists to assign higher scores, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**:\n   - Based on the code snippet and reports, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be **0**.\n   - The confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final conclusion**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0  \n\nThere are no indications of malicious activity or security issues in this code snippet.",
