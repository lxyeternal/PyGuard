{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and define a version, likely for a Python package related to scoring, caching, and byte handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .score, .cache, .nbytes",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from local modules, which suggests modular design. The only other statement is defining a version string. There are no functions, user inputs, or network interactions. The code is very straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple setup fragment for a Python package with no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security concerns based on this snippet.",
