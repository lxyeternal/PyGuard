{
  "purpose": "The code implements a scoring system for cache management, tracking costs and usage frequency to determine the importance of cached items.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters in the 'touch' method (key, cost) and internal state variables (self.cost, self.time, self._base, self._base_multiplier).",
  "sinks": "Calculations involving self.cost and self.time, but no direct untrusted data output, network communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'cost' and 'key' are used to update internal dictionaries and compute scores; no external output or data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and primarily mathematical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The class manages cache scoring based on access cost and frequency, using logarithmic decay for scoring. No external data sources, user input beyond parameters, or side-effects are observed. The code contains standard library usage and well-documented logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign cache scoring utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs internal calculations without external dependencies or harmful actions.",
