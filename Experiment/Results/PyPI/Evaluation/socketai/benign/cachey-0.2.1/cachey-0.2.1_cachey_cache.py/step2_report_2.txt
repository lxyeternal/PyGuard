  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard caching utility with no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It uses typical libraries, handles cache management, and provides memoization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a legitimate cache with no malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Slightly higher risk, possibly due to cautious default or minor uncertainties, but still consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No red flags; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Also describes a standard cache with no suspicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Consistent with the previous reports.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; scores seem justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious or suspicious activity. The code appears safe and purpose-driven.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward cache with no malicious indicators. Uses timing for cost calculation, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly lower risk, reflecting high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. Given the code's nature—standard caching, no network calls, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution—the malware score should be **0**.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports find no obfuscation. The code is clear and readable. Obfuscated should be **0**.\n  \n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk scores are around 0.2, justified by the potential for misuse in a malicious context, but the code itself appears benign. A conservative, yet reasonable, overall risk score would be **0.1** to **0.2**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, the code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1, reflecting minimal risk based on the code's purpose and the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses and the code's apparent purpose as a legitimate caching utility.",
