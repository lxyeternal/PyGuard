{
  "purpose": "Implements an in-memory caching system with intelligent eviction policies based on cost, usage, and recency to optimize storage and retrieval of computed data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function inputs, cache keys, and time measurements within the memoize method. The cache also accesses scorer object methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to cache, retrieves data from cache, and calls user-provided functions. No untrusted data flow outside of caching logic.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed to generate cache keys, which are used to store and retrieve cache entries. Timing measurements are used for scoring cache entries. User functions are called only within memoize, with results cached.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. The code structure and logic align with standard caching implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a cache class with typical methods: put, get, resize, shrink, and memoize. It employs scoring for cache management and uses time measurements for function memoization. No external network access, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling is present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a cost-aware cache with memoization features, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured caching utility designed for performance optimization in Python applications. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for caching purposes, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
