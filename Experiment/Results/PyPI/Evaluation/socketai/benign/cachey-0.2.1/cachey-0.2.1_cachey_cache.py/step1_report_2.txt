{
  "purpose": "Implements a caching mechanism for expensive computations with memory and cost-based eviction policies, including memoization of functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, keys, and external cache data; uses time for cost calculations.",
  "sinks": "Stores and retrieves data in internal dictionaries and heap; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Function arguments -> cache key generation -> cache get/put -> function execution and result caching",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; use of standard libraries and functions; no hidden network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a cache with eviction based on cost, size, and usage scoring. It uses external libraries for data structures and timing, with standard function definitions and no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious payloads are present. The memoization wraps functions securely without executing untrusted code beyond the intended function call. The cache management logic appears legitimate and focused on performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a caching and memoization system without malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages internal data structures and employs standard practices for cache eviction and function memoization.",
