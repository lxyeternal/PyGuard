  "purpose": "A size- and usage-aware caching utility that stores computation results, prioritizing expensive, frequently used, and recent data to optimize resource utilization.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to memoized functions, system time for measuring execution duration, cache key generation from function arguments and keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures (self.data, self.heap, self.nbytes) for storing cached values, scores, and sizes; no external network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Function arguments and keyword arguments are used to generate cache keys; cache keys are used to retrieve or store data; timing functions measure execution duration for cost calculation; cache management functions modify internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and purpose-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard size- and usage-aware cache with memoization capabilities. It uses external libraries (heapdict, Scorer, nbytes) for priority management and scoring. The logic for cache eviction, scoring, and memoization aligns with typical caching strategies. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign caching utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1). The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
