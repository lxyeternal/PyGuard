{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'cachey' caching library, verifying cache operations, resizing, memoization, callbacks, and reference counting.",
  "sources": "Internal library functions, test function parameters, and static data within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and internal data structures; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from cache put/get operations through assertions, with no external untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions for cachey, performing cache operations, resizing, memoization, and callback testing. It uses standard Python constructs, assertions, and internal data management. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended for testing purposes only. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are identified. The logic is consistent and typical for unit tests, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for the cachey library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its nature as test code. The high confidence scores (near 1) support this assessment.",
