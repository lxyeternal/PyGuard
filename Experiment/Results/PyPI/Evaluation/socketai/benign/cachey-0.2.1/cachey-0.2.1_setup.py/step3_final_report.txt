  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'cachey' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files for dependencies and long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads without validation.",
  "flows": "File reads from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' into setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open()' without exception handling, but this is typical in setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script for packaging, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. It reads static files for dependencies and description, which is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The lack of exception handling for file reads could cause runtime errors if files are missing but does not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with this assessment: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
