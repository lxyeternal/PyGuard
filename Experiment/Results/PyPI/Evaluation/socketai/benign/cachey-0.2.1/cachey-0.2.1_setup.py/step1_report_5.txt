{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cachey' Python package, used for package installation and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, 'README.md' for long description, and static package metadata.",
  "targets": "None of the data or code directly interacts with untrusted input or user data; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools for packaging. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and a README file for documentation. There are no indications of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscated logic. All file reads are from local files necessary for package setup. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices without any anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
