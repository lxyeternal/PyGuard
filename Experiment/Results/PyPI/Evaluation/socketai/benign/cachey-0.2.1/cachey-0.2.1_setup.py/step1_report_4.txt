{
  "purpose": "To configure and set up the 'cachey' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description, static assignment of package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only reading files and static assignment.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies and description files during setup, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools. It reads dependency list from 'requirements.txt' and description from 'README.md' if present. No user input, network activity, or code execution is involved beyond static file reading. No suspicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
