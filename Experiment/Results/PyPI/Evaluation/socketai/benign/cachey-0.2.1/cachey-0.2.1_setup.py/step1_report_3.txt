  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'cachey' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description, and static metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code interacts with untrusted data or external inputs at runtime; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs file reads for dependencies and descriptions without validation, but this is typical for setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and a description from 'README.md'. There are no dynamic evaluations, no external data inputs at runtime, and no suspicious behaviors. All operations are static file reads and metadata definitions common in Python package setup processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It only performs file reads and metadata setup for packaging.",
