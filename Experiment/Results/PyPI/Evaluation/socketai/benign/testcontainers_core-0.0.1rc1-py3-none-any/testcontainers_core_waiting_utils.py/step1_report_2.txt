{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for waiting on Docker containers to be ready or to emit specific logs, mainly used for testing or automation workflows involving containerized services.",
  "sources": "User-provided container logs via 'container.get_logs()'; input parameters such as 'condition' or 'predicate' functions/strings.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs through 'logger' and exceptions raised; container log decoding and pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Logs are fetched from 'container.get_logs()', decoded, and tested against regex or condition functions; exceptions may be raised if timeouts occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior or obfuscated code observed. Usage of standard modules and clear function logic.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly implements retry logic for container readiness and log pattern matching. It imports safe standard modules (re, time, traceback), and a 'wrapt' decorator for retry handling. It uses logging for traceability and handles exceptions like TimeoutError and ConnectionError appropriately. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The functions are designed to wait for container conditions and logs, which are typical in container orchestration or testing environments. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for container health checks and log monitoring, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It functions within expected parameters for container management and testing automation.",
