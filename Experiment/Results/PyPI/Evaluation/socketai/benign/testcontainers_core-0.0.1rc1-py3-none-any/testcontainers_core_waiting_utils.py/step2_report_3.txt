  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements utility functions for waiting on container readiness (`wait_container_is_ready`) and log conditions (`wait_for_logs`).\n- Uses standard modules (`re`, `time`, `traceback`) and a third-party decorator (`wrapt`).\n- Reads configuration parameters (`MAX_TRIES`, `SLEEP_TIME`) from `testcontainers.core.config`.\n- Retrieves logs via `container.get_logs()`, decodes them, and searches for patterns or conditions.\n- Handles transient exceptions (`TimeoutError`, `ConnectionError`) with retries.\n- No data is written or transmitted externally; no secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues or vulnerabilities are present.** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs common utility functions in container testing environments.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **None detected.** The logic for retries, exception handling, and log parsing appears correct and safe.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- All reports assign **malware scores of 0 or very close to 0**, which is appropriate.\n- The **security risk scores** are low (0.0 to 0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The **confidence levels** are high, reflecting the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are below 0.5, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- Given the code's purpose and behavior, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly identify **no malicious activity**.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on log parsing, retries, and exception handling, which are standard practices.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, standard utility functions)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed reviews and the code's nature, I concur with the provided assessments. I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect a benign, well-structured utility module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate utility for container readiness and log monitoring, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent.",
