{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to wait for container readiness and log conditions, primarily used in testing environments involving Docker containers.",
  "sources": "Reads from the container's logs via container.get_logs(). Uses configuration variables from testcontainers.core.config (e.g., MAX_TRIES, SLEEP_TIME).",
  "sinks": "Logs decoded from container.get_logs() are searched with regex; no direct untrusted input sinks identified. No data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Container logs are retrieved repeatedly; logs are searched for patterns to determine if conditions are met. No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes standard retry and wait logic with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script implements wait mechanisms based on retries and log pattern matching, using regex searches on container logs. It relies on configurable parameters and exception handling for transient errors. The code uses safe practices for waiting and logging, with no evident malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. There are no external network communications, no code injection points, and no data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate container readiness and log monitoring functions typical of testing utilities. It does not contain malicious code, sabotage, or malware indicators. The overall security risk is very low.",
