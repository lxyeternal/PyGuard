{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for waiting on container readiness and log patterns, primarily used for managing containerized testing environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from the 'config' module, container logs via 'container.get_logs()', and exception handling via standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'container.get_logs()' method, which retrieves container logs, and the 'wait_for' functions that execute provided conditions.",
  "flows": "Inputs from 'config' and 'container.get_logs()' flow into regex searches and exception handling; 'wait_container_is_ready' executes wrapped functions; 'wait_for_logs' polls logs and matches against patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The functions seem to serve straightforward utility purposes. No suspicious dynamic execution or external data transmission is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules and defines utility functions to wait for container readiness and log conditions, using retries, exception handling, and regex pattern matching. It logs progress via a logger, handles transient exceptions, and raises timeouts when conditions aren't met. No suspicious data handling, external communications, or malware-like behaviors are evident. The functions rely on container log access and configuration parameters, which are typical in test environments. No anomalies or malicious code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing container wait conditions, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for testing and monitoring container states.",
