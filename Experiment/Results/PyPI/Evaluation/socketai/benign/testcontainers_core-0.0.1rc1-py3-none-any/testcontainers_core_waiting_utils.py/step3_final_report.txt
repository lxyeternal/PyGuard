  "purpose": "Utility functions for container readiness and log monitoring, including waiting for container to be ready and waiting for specific log patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads logs via container.get_logs(), accesses configuration variables for retries and sleep intervals.",
  "sinks": "Decodes logs and performs regex searches; no data is transmitted externally or written to files.",
  "flows": "Retrieves logs, decodes them, applies regex or predicate functions to determine conditions, with retries on exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard container health check utilities with exception handling, log parsing, and retries. It uses common modules and practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The log decoding and regex matching are safe operations, and no external network activity or data exfiltration is present. The exception handling and retry logic are standard for such utilities. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for container readiness and log monitoring, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and malware score is zero. The code poses no security concerns.",
