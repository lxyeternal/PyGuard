{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for waiting on container readiness and log conditions in a testing environment using Docker containers.",
  "sources": "Reads include config.MAX_TRIES, config.SLEEP_TIME, container.get_logs(), and parameters passed to functions (condition, predicate, timeout).",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include decoding logs without validation, but no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations or system commands.",
  "flows": "The flow involves retrieving logs from a container, applying regex matching or callable predicates, and waiting until conditions are met or timeout occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Use of standard libraries and patterns suggests normal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements retry logic for container readiness and log monitoring based on regex or condition predicates. It uses standard exception handling and logging mechanisms. No obfuscated code, unsafe code injection, or suspicious data handling is detected. It relies on configuration parameters and container logs without executing untrusted code or leaking data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard testing utility for containerized environments, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any insecure operations, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. Overall, it seems safe and benign.",
