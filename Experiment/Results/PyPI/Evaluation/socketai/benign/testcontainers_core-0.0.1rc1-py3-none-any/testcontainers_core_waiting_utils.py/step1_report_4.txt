  "purpose": "Utility functions for waiting on container readiness and log conditions in test environments.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from 'config', container logs via 'container.get_logs()', and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations; primarily log parsing and exception handling.",
  "flows": "The functions call container methods to get logs and handle exceptions, then perform regex searches on logs to determine flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of regular expressions for log matching is standard. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides decorators and functions to wait for containers to be ready by retrying operations with exception handling. It utilizes configuration for timeout and polling intervals. The 'wait_for_logs' function fetches container logs, decodes them, and searches for a pattern or string, raising a TimeoutError if conditions are unmet within a specified period. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident. Usage appears intended for testing or orchestration, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for container readiness and log monitoring with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It operates solely within expected parameters for such functions.",
