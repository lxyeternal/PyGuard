{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be test cases for verifying Docker container behavior using the testcontainers library, focusing on log output and timeout handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from Docker container logs and commands executed within containers.",
  "targets": "Uses log outputs to determine flow control, such as timing out or verifying specific log messages.",
  "flows": "Container execution and log retrieval as source-to-sink paths, primarily to check for expected log output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Usage is consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and container management modules, then defines three test functions that start Docker containers, wait for specific log outputs, and retrieve logs. The functions perform standard container testing operations such as timing out and log verification. No code appears to perform unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. No obfuscated or malicious code segments identified. All operations align with legitimate testing scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of container-based test cases for log verification and timeout handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks present.",
