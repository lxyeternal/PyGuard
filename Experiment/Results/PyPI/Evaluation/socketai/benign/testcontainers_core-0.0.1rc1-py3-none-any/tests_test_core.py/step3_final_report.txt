{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based tests for Docker containers, verifying log output and timeout behavior using the testcontainers library.",
  "sources": "The code reads container logs via wait_for_logs() and container.get_logs() functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; logs are only read and asserted locally.",
  "flows": "Logs are retrieved from containers and checked for specific messages; no external data flow or transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard container testing operations: starting containers, waiting for specific logs, handling timeouts, and retrieving logs. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The timeout test with a very short timeout is typical for testing timeout handling and does not indicate malicious intent. The images used are standard and benign. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code for Docker containers, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
