  "purpose": "A Docker container management class providing methods to configure, start, stop, execute commands, and retrieve logs from Docker containers, utilizing Docker SDK and testcontainers libraries.",
  "sources": "External inputs via methods like with_env, with_command, exec, and get_exposed_port; Docker SDK API calls for container operations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of arbitrary commands through exec(), retrieval of logs, and network port mappings that could be misused if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Inputs from user-configured parameters flow into Docker SDK calls for container creation, command execution, and port retrieval; potential untrusted data could flow into exec() and command parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of exec() and command parameters could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but this is standard for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Docker container management utility with standard practices. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. The primary security concern is the potential misuse of exec() with untrusted inputs, which is inherent to container management tools. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature, with potential risks limited to external input handling, not the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Docker container management class with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality. The main consideration is ensuring external inputs are sanitized when used with exec() or commands, but the code itself is safe.",
