  "purpose": "This code provides a Python class to manage Docker containers for testing and development purposes, including starting, stopping, and configuring containers.",
  "sources": "User-supplied parameters such as 'image', 'command', 'name', environment variables, port mappings, volume mappings, and additional kwargs; environment variables via os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "Docker client methods such as run(), remove(), exec_run(), and logs() that interact with containers; environment variables are used internally but not transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (image, commands, env vars, ports, volumes) flow into container configuration methods; start() initiates container creation; get_logs() and exec() access container data; stop() terminates container.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of external libraries (testcontainers) appears standard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. The code manages containers securely via provided API.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class to manage Docker containers, with methods for configuration and lifecycle management. It uses environment variables and external parameters safely, relying on Docker SDK calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. All external interactions are explicitly invoked via standard Docker SDK functions, and environment variables are used locally. The code appears to be a straightforward container management utility with no malicious intent or suspicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical Docker container management utility, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on user input and external libraries in a standard manner, and no suspicious or harmful actions are present.",
