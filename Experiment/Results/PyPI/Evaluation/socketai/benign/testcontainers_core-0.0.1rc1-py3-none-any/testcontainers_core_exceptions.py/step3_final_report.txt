  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions related to container and browser management.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are standalone definitions without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of five custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception. There are no external data sources, sinks, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practice for defining custom exceptions. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0. This is consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security risks. The reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately rated. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
