  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the corresponding reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code contains five custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no functions, data handling, external inputs/outputs, or any complex logic. The classes are simple and serve as specific error types, likely for container or browser management.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Are the reported issues present in the code?\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, containing only class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports accurately reflect the code's content. No issues or anomalies are present beyond standard exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, external data handling, or malicious constructs. They emphasize the absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent with the code. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue\n\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All report 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **SecurityRisk:** All report 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores seem consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5\n\n- The risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions\n\n- All reports correctly state that there are no external data sources, sinks, or suspicious patterns.  \n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is based solely on code inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores with the report\n\n- The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: My own assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                | No malicious activity or patterns present.                 |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                | Clear, straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation. |\n| Risk            | 0                | No security risk detected in the code.                      |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.**",
