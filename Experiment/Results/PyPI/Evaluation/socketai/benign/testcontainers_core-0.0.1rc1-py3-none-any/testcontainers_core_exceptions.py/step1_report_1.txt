  "flows": "No data flows, input/output, or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Code only contains class definitions for exceptions with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. There are no external data sources, no data sinks, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The classes are simple and serve as custom exception types. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code is minimal and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
