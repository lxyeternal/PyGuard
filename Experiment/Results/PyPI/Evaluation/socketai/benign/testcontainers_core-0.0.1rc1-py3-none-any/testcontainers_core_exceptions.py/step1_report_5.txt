  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application, likely related to container management or browser automation.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write output or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining only exception classes without any suspicious or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
