  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security risk, and the code is purely exception class definitions, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No evidence suggests any security concern that warrants a higher risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume vulnerabilities or malicious intent without evidence.\n   - Their conclusions are justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings are apparent.\n\n**Final Summary & Personal Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (benign, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a minimal, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and appropriately rated.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nNo further action needed; the code is safe and benign.",
