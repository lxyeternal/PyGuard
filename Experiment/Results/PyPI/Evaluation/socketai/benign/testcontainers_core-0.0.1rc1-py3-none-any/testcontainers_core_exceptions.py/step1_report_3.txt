  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions with no input reading",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance for exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code defines five custom exception classes inheriting from Python's base Exception class. There are no input sources, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve as specific error types, which is standard practice in Python. No malicious patterns, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
