  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's `Exception`. There are no external data sources, data sinks, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard practice for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. They accurately describe the code's simplicity and purpose. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n\n   These scores are consistent with the code's nature. Since the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   The reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. No justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct given the code. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding assumptions about hidden behaviors or malicious intent. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable based on the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the given scores.**",
