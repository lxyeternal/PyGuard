  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python application, likely related to container or browser management.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. These are custom exceptions with no additional logic, attributes, or external interactions. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no external dependencies or code obfuscation. The content appears standard and straightforward, serving as part of error handling in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Overall, it is a benign component of an application’s error handling.",
