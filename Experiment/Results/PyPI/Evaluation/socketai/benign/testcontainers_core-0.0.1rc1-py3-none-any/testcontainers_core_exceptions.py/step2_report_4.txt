  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**:  \nThe code consists solely of five custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`. There are no functions, data handling, external data sources, or dynamic code execution. The classes are simple and serve as specific error types, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n- **Confirmed**: The code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Not present**: No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.  \n- **Logical errors**: None. The code's purpose is clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports**:  \nAll reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security risk factors. They assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0, which seems reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n- **Malware Score**: Correctly 0. No malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: Correctly 0. The code is not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential for Reconsideration**:  \nSince the code is just exception class definitions, there is no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.5. The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n6. **Additional Observations**:  \n- The reports are thorough and consistent.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on code content.  \n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code provided. No modifications are necessary. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that.",
