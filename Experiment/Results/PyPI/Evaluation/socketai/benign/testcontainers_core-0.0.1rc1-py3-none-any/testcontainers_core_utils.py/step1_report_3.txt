{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to determine OS type, environment, and network details such as gateway IP within a container or host system.",
  "sources": "Reads system files (e.g., '/.dockerenv'), system platform info, machine architecture, and executes shell commands ('sh -c ...').",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess with 'sh -c' command that retrieves network routing information, potentially exposing environment or network details.",
  "flows": "System detection functions (os_name, is_mac, is_linux, is_windows, is_arm, inside_container) gather environment info. default_gateway_ip executes shell command, possibly influenced by environment variables or system state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Uses standard system calls and subprocess execution. No suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for environment detection and network info retrieval. It uses standard libraries and safe subprocess calls to gather system info. The subprocess call to 'sh -c ip route...' is intended to find the default gateway IP, which could reveal network configuration but does not perform malicious actions. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for environment detection and network configuration insights. No signs of malicious intent or security risks. It could be used for legitimate system diagnostics or environment-specific logic.",
