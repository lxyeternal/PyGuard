{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for environment detection, such as OS type, container status, and network configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads system files (/.dockerenv), system platform info (sys.platform, platform.machine()), and executes a shell command to obtain network info.",
  "sinks": "Executes a subprocess to run a shell command that retrieves network routing info; reads from the filesystem to check for container environment.",
  "flows": "Reads environment indicators (filesystem, platform info) and executes a shell command to gather network info; data flows from system environment to code logic.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess.Popen with a shell command that could potentially be manipulated if the command string were influenced, but in this code, the command is hardcoded and not influenced by external input. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection through standard system checks and a subprocess call to obtain network configuration. It does not process untrusted input or handle user-supplied data. The subprocess command is static and safe in this context. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. Functions are straightforward and primarily for environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard environment utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any data exfiltration, malicious actions, or contain hardcoded credentials. The subprocess usage is secure given the static command string.",
