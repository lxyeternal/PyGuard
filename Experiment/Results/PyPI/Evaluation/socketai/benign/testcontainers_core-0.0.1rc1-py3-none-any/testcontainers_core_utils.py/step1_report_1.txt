{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to detect OS type, environment (inside container), and network configuration (gateway IP).",
  "sources": "Reads system files (/.dockerenv), system platform information (sys.platform, platform.machine()), and executes a subprocess to get network routing info.",
  "sinks": "Executes a shell command to retrieve network route information via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "System environment checks and subprocess call to fetch network info; no untrusted data input flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to run shell commands, but the command is static and does not process untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily checks environment characteristics and system details. The subprocess call runs a fixed command ('ip route|awk ...') to get network info, which is standard. The functions for OS detection and environment detection are typical. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is observed. The subprocess execution is safe given the static command and no input from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving utility functions to identify environment and network info. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
