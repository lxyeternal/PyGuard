{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to determine the operating system, environment, and network configuration, likely used in a larger application to adapt behavior based on environment context.",
  "sources": "Reads environment data through os.path.exists('/.dockerenv') and subprocess calls to 'ip route|awk ...', as well as system information via sys.platform and platform.machine().",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to execute shell commands, which could potentially be exploited if input is manipulated, but here it is static and controlled.",
  "flows": "The functions gather system info and network details without propagating untrusted data to external systems or insecurely handling inputs; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose aligns with environment detection; no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing environment detection functionalities: OS type, container detection, and gateway IP retrieval. subprocess is used with static commands; no user input or external untrusted data influences command execution. The functions are typical utilities for environment-aware applications. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The code's behavior appears benign and consistent with system querying and environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for environment detection, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs system checks and network info retrieval in a controlled manner, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
