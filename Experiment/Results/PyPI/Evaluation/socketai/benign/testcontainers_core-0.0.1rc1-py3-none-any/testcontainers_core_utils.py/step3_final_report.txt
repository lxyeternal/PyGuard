{
  "purpose": "Provides environment detection functions for OS type, container presence, architecture, and retrieves the default gateway IP address.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information via sys.platform and platform.machine(), checks for the existence of '/.dockerenv', executes a static shell command via subprocess to get network routing info.",
  "sinks": "Executes a static shell command 'sh -c ip route|awk ...' without untrusted input influence.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows into the subprocess; data is gathered from system files and platform info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses static commands and standard system checks; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and network info retrieval using static, safe commands. No user input or external data influences subprocess execution. The subprocess call is standard and safe in this context. The functions are straightforward, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. Minor improvements could include handling unexpected platform strings or subprocess errors more robustly, but these do not impact security. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for environment detection and network info retrieval. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The static subprocess commands are safe given the current implementation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
