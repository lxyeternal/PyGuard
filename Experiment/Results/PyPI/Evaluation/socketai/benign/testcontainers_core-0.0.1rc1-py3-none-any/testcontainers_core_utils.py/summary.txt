  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for environment detection and network info retrieval. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The static subprocess commands are safe given the current implementation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
