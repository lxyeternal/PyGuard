  "purpose": "Infrastructure code for managing Docker containers for databases, constructing connection URLs, and establishing connections using SQLAlchemy for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided to get_connection_url() (dialect, username, password, host, port, db_name); get_container_host_ip(); get_exposed_port()",
  "sinks": "SQLAlchemy engine connection; network connection to database via constructed URL",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> get_connection_url() -> engine.connect()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code constructs database connection URLs from user-supplied parameters and attempts to connect via SQLAlchemy. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. Error handling is typical, and no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is present. The code's purpose is benign infrastructure setup for testing environments. The connection URL construction relies on parameters, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. The use of decorators to wait for container readiness and the dynamic URL generation are standard practices. Overall, the code is straightforward, correct, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign infrastructure code for managing Dockerized database containers, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and appropriate given the code's nature.",
