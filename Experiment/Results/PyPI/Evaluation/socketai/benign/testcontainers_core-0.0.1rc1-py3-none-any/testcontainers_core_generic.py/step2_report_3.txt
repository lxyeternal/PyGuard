  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard, benign infrastructure code for managing Dockerized database containers.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code relies on user-provided parameters for connection URLs, which is typical for such utilities.\n- The code does not exhibit obfuscation or signs of malware.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The connection URL construction uses parameters supplied at runtime, which could be exploited if those parameters are maliciously crafted. However, this is standard behavior and not inherently malicious.\n- The code does not transmit or store untrusted data externally; it only constructs URLs and connects to databases.\n- The `get_connection_url()` method raises `NotImplementedError`, implying subclasses are responsible for specific implementations, which is typical and not suspicious.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 is assigned in all reports, indicating a low but non-zero risk, which seems reasonable given the code's nature—handling sensitive parameters like credentials, but in a controlled manner.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- While the code itself appears benign, the use of user-supplied parameters for credentials and connection details means that if an attacker supplies malicious parameters, they could cause issues (e.g., connection failures, resource exhaustion). However, this is typical for such infrastructure code and does not constitute malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to parameter handling but no inherent vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a benign, standard utility for managing Docker-based database containers in testing environments. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present.",
