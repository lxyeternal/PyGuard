{
  "purpose": "Defines a Docker container class for database testing with connection management and waiting utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from testcontainers and sqlalchemy, self.get_connection_url() and get_container_host_ip() methods, environment for container runtime.",
  "sinks": "Engine connection creation and execution, potentially connecting to external databases.",
  "flows": "get_connection_url() generates a database URL; _connect() creates an engine with this URL and connects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard use of third-party libraries; no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a containerized database environment, with mechanisms to wait for readiness and establish connections via SQLAlchemy. It dynamically constructs connection URLs based on runtime parameters without hardcoded secrets. No suspicious network activity, credential theft, or malicious behavior detected. The import of sqlalchemy and container management is typical for testing setups. No obfuscation or anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for database container testing with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It manages connections securely and dynamically without hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity.",
