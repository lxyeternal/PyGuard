  "purpose": "Read configuration parameters from environment variables 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL', converting them to integers for use in the application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL' accessed via environ.get()",
  "sinks": "Conversion to int; assignment to constants, no external data flow or output",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> environ.get() -> int() conversion -> assignment to MAX_TRIES and SLEEP_TIME",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment variable access and conversion, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code reads two environment variables with default values, converts them to integers, and assigns them to constants. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The only potential concern is external manipulation of environment variables, which is standard in configuration but could lead to misbehavior if not validated. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected. The code is simple, correct, and aligns with typical configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious activity or security issues. The environment variables are used appropriately, and the code is straightforward. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports accounts for external control of environment variables but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
