  "purpose": "Initialize configuration parameters for maximum retries and pooling interval using environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL' via os.environ.get()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; environment variable values are used to set integer constants",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> int() conversion -> assignment to MAX_TRIES and SLEEP_TIME",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard environment variable access and conversion",
  "analysis": "The code imports the environ dictionary from os, then reads two environment variables. It converts their values to integers, with default values if variables are absent. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code. The code appears to set configuration parameters in a typical manner. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup using environment variables with default fallbacks. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
