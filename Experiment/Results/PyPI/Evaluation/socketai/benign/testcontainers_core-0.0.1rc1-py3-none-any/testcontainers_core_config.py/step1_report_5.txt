{
  "purpose": "The code initializes configuration parameters from environment variables, likely for controlling retry attempts and pooling intervals.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL' using environ.get().",
  "sinks": "Assigns the retrieved values to MAX_TRIES and SLEEP_TIME variables for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read (sources) and their values are converted to integers and assigned to internal variables (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code properly handles environment variables with default values. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'environ' from os, then retrieves two environment variables with default fallback values, converting them to integers. This is a typical pattern for configurable parameters. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and secure, assuming the environment variables are managed properly and not maliciously manipulated externally.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard configuration code for parameter setup via environment variables with safe defaults. There is no malicious behavior detected.",
