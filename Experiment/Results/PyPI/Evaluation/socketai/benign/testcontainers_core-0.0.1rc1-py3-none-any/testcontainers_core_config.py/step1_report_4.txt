  "purpose": "To load configuration parameters from environment variables for controlling retry attempts and polling interval in a process.",
  "sources": "The environment variables 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL' accessed via os.environ.get().",
  "sinks": "Variables MAX_TRIES and SLEEP_TIME used within the program's control flow.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> int conversion -> assignment to MAX_TRIES and SLEEP_TIME.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code straightforwardly reads environment variables and converts to integers. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the environ object from os to access environment variables. It retrieves 'TC_MAX_TRIES' with a default of 120 and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL' with a default of 1, converting both to integers. These values likely control retry logic and polling frequency. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Usage of environment variables for configuration is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration setup for retry and polling intervals, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. It securely reads parameters from environment variables without hardcoding secrets or executing unsafe operations.",
