{
  "purpose": "The code initializes two configuration parameters from environment variables: maximum tries and pooling interval.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL' accessed via environ.get.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads environment variables, no untrusted data flows or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and converted to integers, with no further data flow or processing beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is common; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. Default values are set appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'environ' from the os module and reads two environment variables, converting them to integers. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external data sources beyond environment variables. The code is straightforward and typical for configuration purposes. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a standard environment-based configuration setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not involve any sensitive operations beyond reading environment variables.",
