{
  "purpose": "The code reads configuration parameters for maximum retries and polling interval from environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL' via os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "Variables MAX_TRIES and SLEEP_TIME which are used in the application logic.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> environment.get() -> integer conversion -> assignment to MAX_TRIES and SLEEP_TIME.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code. Usage of environment variables is standard for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'environ' from 'os' to access environment variables. It retrieves 'TC_MAX_TRIES' and 'TC_POOLING_INTERVAL', defaulting to 120 and 1 respectively if not set, and converts them to integers. This is typical configuration handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code patterns present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code safely loads configuration parameters from environment variables for retries and polling interval without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
