{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper around Docker SDK for running and managing containers, including utility functions for container interactions.",
  "sources": "Uses environment variables (os.environ.get), Docker SDK methods (docker.from_env, client.containers.run, client.api.port, client.api.containers), and internal functions like inside_container() and default_gateway_ip().",
  "sinks": "Container management commands and network information functions (port, bridge_ip, gateway_ip). No direct data sinks that send data externally or store secrets.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or SDK calls → container management functions → network info retrieval; no external data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed. Use of environment variables for host configuration is standard. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility wrapper for Docker operations, managing containers, ports, and network info. It uses standard libraries and patterns for container orchestration. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The functions perform typical container lifecycle management and network querying tasks without unusual or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, serving as a container management utility without malicious intent. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns identified. It operates within expected norms for Docker-related scripts.",
