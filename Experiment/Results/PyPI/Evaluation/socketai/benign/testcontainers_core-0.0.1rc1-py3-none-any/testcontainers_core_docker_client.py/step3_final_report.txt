  "purpose": "A utility wrapper around Docker SDK for container lifecycle management and network information retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('TC_HOST'), container IDs, and parameters for container operations and network info.",
  "sinks": "Docker API calls for container control, network info, and port mappings; no external data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and function parameters to Docker API methods, retrieving container network settings and controlling container lifecycle.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns; standard error handling and environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Docker SDK wrapper managing container start/stop, network info, and port mappings. It uses environment variables for configuration, handles exceptions properly, and performs expected container operations. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Docker utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current security scores are appropriate and should remain as is unless new suspicious behavior emerges.",
