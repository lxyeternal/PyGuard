  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper around Docker SDK for container management and network info retrieval.\n- It reads environment variables like 'TC_HOST' for configuration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- No external data exfiltration, malicious command execution, or backdoors are apparent.\n- Error handling appears standard.\n- The code relies on standard libraries and practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code performs container start/stop, port retrieval, and network info access via Docker SDK.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The use of environment variables is typical and not suspicious.\n- No obfuscation or malware patterns are present.\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Container management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues found.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, utility wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar container management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no issues.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Container wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, but justified as the code interacts with system and container configurations, which could be misused if exploited, but nothing indicates malicious intent.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, as misconfiguration or misuse could cause issues, but no direct vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — low, due to environment variable reliance and container management, but no evident security flaw.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. The scores are reasonable and justified. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that environment variables like 'TC_HOST' are controlled and validated in deployment environments to prevent misconfiguration, but this does not constitute malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The code is a standard, legitimate Docker container management utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate.**",
