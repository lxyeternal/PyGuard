{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Docker client wrapper for managing Docker containers, including starting, stopping, and retrieving container information.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.environ), Docker API responses (docker.client), and method parameters such as image, command, environment, ports, container_id.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with Docker API endpoints that could potentially execute commands, expose container ports, or retrieve container network settings. The 'port' method returns host port mappings, and 'get_container', 'bridge_ip', 'gateway_ip' access container network data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (image, container_id, environment) flow into Docker API calls; environment variables can influence container behavior; port mappings are retrieved from container data; container network info is accessed via API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code does not perform any network requests outside Docker API interactions. It uses standard Docker SDK methods. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around Docker SDK, providing methods to run containers, fetch port mappings, and retrieve network info. It handles errors gracefully, logs warnings, and registers cleanup functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard practice. All interactions are limited to Docker container management, with no external or suspicious network communications initiated. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for container management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Docker management wrapper with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It handles container operations securely and does not contain suspicious or malicious code patterns. Its functions are consistent with legitimate container orchestration tasks.",
