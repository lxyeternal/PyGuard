{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around Docker API for managing containers, including starting, stopping, and retrieving network information.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'TC_HOST'), container IDs, container network details, and user input parameters for container management functions.",
  "targets": "Uses container IDs, environment variables, and URLs to interact with Docker and network settings, with no direct data output or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and parameters feed into Docker API calls, which return container details or network info. No untrusted data flows directly to external systems or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of try-except blocks for container stop indicates standard error handling, not malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code wraps Docker SDK functions for container lifecycle and network management. It uses environment variables for configuration, which is common practice. The functions perform expected operations like running containers, stopping them, and retrieving network info. The use of 'atexit' ensures containers are stopped on script termination, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables and network data, but these are typical in container management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Docker management utility without malicious intent. It handles container operations and network info securely, with no signs of malware or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious behaviors.",
