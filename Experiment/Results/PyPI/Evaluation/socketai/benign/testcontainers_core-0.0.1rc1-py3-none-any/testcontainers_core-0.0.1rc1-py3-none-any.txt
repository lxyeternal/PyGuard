      "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious activity or security issues. The environment variables are used appropriately, and the code is straightforward. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports accounts for external control of environment variables but does not indicate malicious behavior."

The static subprocess commands are safe given the current implementation. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low risk. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
