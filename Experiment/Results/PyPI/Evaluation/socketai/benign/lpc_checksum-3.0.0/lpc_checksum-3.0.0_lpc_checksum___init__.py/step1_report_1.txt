  "purpose": "Calculate and write checksum for LPC firmware images to ensure data integrity.",
  "sources": "Reads the firmware file specified by filename, including minaddr() and gets() methods from intelhex library.",
  "sinks": "Writes the checksum back to the firmware file using puts() and tofile() methods from intelhex library.",
  "flows": "Reads input file -> computes checksum -> (if not read-only) writes checksum back to file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard libraries; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. No obfuscated code or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The script processes firmware files to compute a checksum based on the first seven 4-byte blocks, then optionally writes this checksum back into the file. Uses the intelhex library for file handling, which is standard for firmware images. No network activity, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious operations are present. Exception handling is straightforward and does not include external or untrusted data manipulation beyond file processing. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for firmware checksum calculation and update.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard checksum utility for firmware images with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs intended functions securely using standard libraries without hidden or malicious code.",
