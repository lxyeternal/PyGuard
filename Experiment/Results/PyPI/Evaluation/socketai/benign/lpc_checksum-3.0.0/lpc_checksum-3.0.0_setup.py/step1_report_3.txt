{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the lpc_checksum Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package data, dependencies, and metadata from variables and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the script only defines static configuration data.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: variables are passed into the setup() function to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, hidden behavior, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points, then invokes setup() with this data. All data appears to be static and intended for package configuration. No external input, user data, or untrusted sources are involved. No code injection, malicious behavior, or hidden logic is evident. The script adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a benign, standard configuration for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
