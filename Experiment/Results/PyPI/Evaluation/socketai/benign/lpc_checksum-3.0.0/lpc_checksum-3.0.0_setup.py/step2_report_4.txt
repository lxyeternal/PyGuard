  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The code solely defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points using static data.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly conclude that the script is benign, following standard practices, and pose no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.  \n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk score of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the script.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a static setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The current score of 0 reflects this accurately.\n\n5. **Consistency with Malware and Obfuscation Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. All indicators point to a benign package configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security threat based on the provided analysis.",
