  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines the packaging configuration for the 'lpc-checksum' Python module, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependency declarations, and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data handling, user input, network activity, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script is static and does not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; all code is standard packaging boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling. It relies on static data for package configuration, with dependencies on well-known libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python packaging script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. All assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
