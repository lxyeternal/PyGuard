  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution, network connections, external modules, input data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable access, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Input data or environment variables potentially flow into dynamic execution or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, unexplained external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is generally benign with straightforward logic, no anomalies, and low security risk. Report 3 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious but not confirmed malicious. Scores are consistent with descriptions; increasing malware score in Report 3 from 0.4 to 0.6 better reflects suspicion. Other reports show no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, with scores aligned to their benign assessments.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears safe with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest moderate suspicion, warranting a slightly higher malware score. Overall, the dependency is likely safe, but caution is advised for code with obfuscation and dynamic features.",
