  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing or computation, but without specific comments or context, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external data sources (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via return statements, print functions, or external API calls (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various processing functions and potentially to output sinks; specific paths are not explicitly detailed in the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is normal, and no unsafe code patterns like unsanitized SQL or insecure eval are observed. The code structure is typical and does not suggest obfuscation or malware. Due to limited context, no covert behaviors are detectable, and no anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears standard and benign. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of complete context or external data interactions.",
