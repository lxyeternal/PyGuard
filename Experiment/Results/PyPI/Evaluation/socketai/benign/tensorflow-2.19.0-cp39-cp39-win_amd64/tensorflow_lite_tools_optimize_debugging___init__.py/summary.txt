  "conclusion": "Most code appears safe with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest moderate suspicion, warranting a slightly higher malware score. Overall, the dependency is likely safe, but caution is advised for code with obfuscation and dynamic features."
