  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python package or script, possibly involving data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose is clearly stated within the code.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input parameters, or file I/O operations (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include network calls, subprocess executions, or data written to files or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file, subprocess), passing through various processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features noted.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard usage patterns, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors. The code uses typical library functions, and no suspicious network connections or data leaks are apparent. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious payloads, or obfuscated segments. The code structure is straightforward, and all third-party libraries are standard. The absence of hardcoded secrets and suspicious control flows suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no malicious intent detected.",
