  "sinks": "No data sinks or sensitive operations are present; no output functions or system calls are detected.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows due to absence of code content.",
  "anomalies": "The code block is empty, which is unusual. There are no comments, no functions, and no logic, suggesting either an incomplete snippet or missing code.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is empty or missing, with no operational content to analyze. Without actual code, no security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies can be assessed. The lack of content prevents any source, sink, or flow identification, and there are no suspicious patterns or obfuscation detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is empty or missing. No malicious behavior or security risks can be identified due to absence of code. It is recommended to review the actual code content for a meaningful security assessment.",
