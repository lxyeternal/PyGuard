  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, user input, files, network connections, or external APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security-impacting actions like network transmissions, file writes, database queries, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources to sinks, indicating how untrusted data could propagate and cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports and behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent, empty, or consists of standard patterns with no suspicious or malicious features. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are evident. The code's benign nature is supported by the lack of anomalies and typical usage patterns. Confidence is high when code is absent or straightforward; lower if limited descriptions are provided, but overall, the analysis indicates no malicious intent or significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "All provided reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious code, assigning appropriate low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The assessments are consistent with the evidence, and no significant revisions are necessary. The overall security posture based on these reports is benign.",
