  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated segments and dynamic execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is elevated due to these signs, though no active malicious activity is confirmed. The malware score is set to 0.75, obfuscation to 0.8, and security risk to 0.75, reflecting significant suspicion. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8)."
