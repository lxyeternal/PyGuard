  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, hardcoded strings, external modules, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, logs, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded strings and suspicious control flow further raises suspicion. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration or system damage are explicitly confirmed, but the obfuscation and dynamic code execution suggest potential malicious behavior. The code's benign parts show standard practices, but the suspicious segments warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated segments and dynamic execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior. The overall security risk is elevated due to these signs, though no active malicious activity is confirmed. The malware score is set to 0.75, obfuscation to 0.8, and security risk to 0.75, reflecting significant suspicion. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8).",
