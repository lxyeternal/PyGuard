  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of exec(), hardcoded credentials, network and file operations, obfuscated variables, dynamic code generation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of untrusted code, network data exfiltration, access to sensitive files or credentials.",
  "flows": "Input sources (exec(), network, file reads) leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or credential theft.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() without sanitization, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple suspicious behaviors including dynamic code execution via exec(), hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, and network operations. These indicators strongly suggest malicious intent. The high malware score (0.85), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8) are justified by these behaviors. Benign code snippets lack such features and are scored accordingly. The assessments are consistent with the evidence, with only a slight adjustment to increase the malware score for the suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code in report 4 exhibits multiple malicious indicators, warranting a high malware score of 0.85, obfuscation score of 0.7, and security risk of 0.8. Other reports are benign, with scores of 0.0 for malware and obfuscation, and low risk. The current scores are appropriate; the only necessary adjustment is increasing the malware score for report 4 to better reflect the severity of the suspicious behaviors.",
