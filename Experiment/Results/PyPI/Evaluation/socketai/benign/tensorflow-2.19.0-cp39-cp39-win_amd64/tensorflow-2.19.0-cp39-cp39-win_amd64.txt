      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard TensorFlow initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is external library loading via environment variables and filesystem paths, which is a known attack vector but not malicious by itself. Overall, the code poses a low security risk."

Other reports are benign, with scores of 0.0 for malware and obfuscation, and low risk. The current scores are appropriate; the only necessary adjustment is increasing the malware score for report 4 to better reflect the severity of the suspicious behaviors."
