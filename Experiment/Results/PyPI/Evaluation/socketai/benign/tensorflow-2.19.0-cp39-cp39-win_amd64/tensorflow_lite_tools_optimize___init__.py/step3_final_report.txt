  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input/output functions, network calls, environment variable access, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, system commands, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks via data processing functions, potential command execution or data exfiltration pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code's purpose seems benign, and the lack of obfuscation or malicious patterns justifies a malware score of 0. The security risk is low (around 0.2), reflecting minimal threat given the limited context. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), based on the thorough review and absence of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Minor adjustment: lowering Report 2's security risk from 0.3 to 0.2 for consistency. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
