{
  "purpose": "This script generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model by parsing its flatbuffer or JSON representation.",
  "sources": "Reads input model file (TFLite or JSON), reads local files (model files, dependencies), and fetches external JavaScript library (d3.v4.min.js from CDN).",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated HTML content to an output file; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from file or object -> converts into dictionary -> generates HTML + embedded JavaScript for visualization -> writes HTML to file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs expected parsing and visualization functions without dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on parsing TensorFlow Lite models, converting them into dictionaries, and rendering HTML with embedded D3.js visualizations. It conditionally imports modules based on package context, loads model data from specified files or objects, and generates comprehensive HTML including style, scripts, and visualization. No external or internal code injections, network communications, or suspicious activities are detected. The code uses standard file I/O, JSON parsing, and data processing routines aligned with its visualization purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign tool designed for visualizing TensorFlow Lite models. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Its operations are consistent with its stated purpose. No security risks or malware are evident from the code review.",
