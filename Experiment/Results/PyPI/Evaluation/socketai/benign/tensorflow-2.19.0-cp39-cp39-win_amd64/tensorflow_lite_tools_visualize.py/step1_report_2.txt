{
  "purpose": "This script visualizes a TensorFlow Lite model as an HTML graph, providing insights into model structure, tensors, and operations.",
  "sources": "Reads model data from a file (JSON or binary .tflite), environment variables (indirectly through imported modules), and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs an HTML file containing embedded JavaScript and JSON data; potentially could include untrusted data in the HTML or JS content.",
  "flows": "Model data is read from a file, parsed into a dict, then embedded into HTML with embedded JavaScript code to render visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses dynamic code generation (d3 visualization script) but only for rendering the provided model data. No code injection or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a TensorFlow Lite model (either from a file or object), parses it into a dictionary, and generates an HTML visualization with embedded JavaScript (d3.js). It uses safe JSON serialization and string formatting, and does not execute or evaluate untrusted code. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The visualization process is strictly presentation-focused. No signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data theft, or code injection, are detected. The dynamic generation of JavaScript is based solely on sanitized model data, with no evident malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models. It processes model data and outputs an HTML page with embedded visualizations, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
