{
  "purpose": "This script visualizes TensorFlow Lite models by converting them into an HTML representation with interactive graph visualization and tables detailing model components.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (.tflite, .json) from filesystem; loads data into Python via open() and json.load(). No other external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML output to specified file; uses string concatenation for HTML content. No execution of untrusted code, network connections, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads model file -> converts into dictionary (via CreateDictFromFlatbuffer or json.load) -> generates HTML with embedded model data and visualization scripts -> writes HTML to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured for a visualization tool.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads model data from a file or object, processes it into a JSON-compatible dictionary, and generates an HTML page with embedded JavaScript for visualization. No evidence of code injection, network activity, or malicious logic. The use of external d3.js for visualization is standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious imports, no dangerous operations such as executing arbitrary code or accessing environment variables. All data handling is confined to file I/O and data transformation. The script is designed solely for visualization, with no malicious payloads or malicious behaviors apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign visualization utility for TensorFlow Lite models. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on the source code analysis. Its purpose is to generate a visual HTML representation from model files. No malware or security threats detected.",
