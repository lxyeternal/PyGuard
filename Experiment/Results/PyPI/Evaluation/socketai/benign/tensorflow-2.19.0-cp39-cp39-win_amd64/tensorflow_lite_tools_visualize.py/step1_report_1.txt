{
  "purpose": "This script visualizes a TensorFlow Lite model by converting it into an HTML representation with embedded D3.js graphs for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (.tflite, .json) from the filesystem, reads file data into bytearrays, loads JSON data, and accesses object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Writes output HTML file, uses os.path.exists and open for file handling, and embeds D3.js scripts directly in HTML.",
  "flows": "File reading (input) -> data parsing (JSON or flatbuffer) -> data processing -> HTML generation -> writing HTML to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Uses standard libraries and legitimate data processing for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file input/output operations to load and process TensorFlow Lite model data. It uses the schema_py_generated module to parse flatbuffer data, then converts it into a JSON-compatible dict structure. The visualization functions generate HTML and D3.js scripts for rendering the model graph. There are no indications of network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious code. The only external resource is the D3.js library loaded via CDN, which is common for visualization purposes. No suspicious code execution or obfuscated segments are present. The code primarily focuses on data visualization without performing any dangerous or unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles data securely and does not include any malware or sabotage mechanisms.",
