{
  "purpose": "A visualization tool that reads TensorFlow Lite model files (.tflite or .json), parses the data, and generates an HTML page embedding a D3.js graph for visual analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads model files from disk (e.g., .tflite, .json), loads schema definitions, and processes model data structures.",
  "sinks": "Writes an HTML file with embedded JavaScript and SVG elements for visualization.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from files, converts flatbuffer data into dictionaries, serializes graph structures into JSON, and embeds into HTML for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. External resource (D3.js CDN) is standard for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data parsing, model data conversion, and HTML generation without executing external commands or network activities. It uses standard libraries and safe data handling. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. External CDN dependency is typical for web visualizations but introduces a minimal external dependency risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, safe visualization utility for TensorFlow Lite models. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external resource loading is a common practice and does not constitute malicious behavior.",
