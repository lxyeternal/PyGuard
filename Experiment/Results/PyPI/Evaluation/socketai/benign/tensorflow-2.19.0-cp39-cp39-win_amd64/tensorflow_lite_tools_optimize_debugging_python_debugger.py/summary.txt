  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TensorFlow Lite debugging utility with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores across all reports are consistent with its benign purpose. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2) due to internal API use, which does not constitute malicious activity."
