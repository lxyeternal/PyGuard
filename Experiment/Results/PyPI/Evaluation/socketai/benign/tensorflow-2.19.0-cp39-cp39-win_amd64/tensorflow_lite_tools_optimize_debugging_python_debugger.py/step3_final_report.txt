{
  "purpose": "A debugging utility for TensorFlow Lite models, focusing on quantization verification, metrics collection, and model analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads model files/bytes, input datasets, and tensor details via internal APIs.",
  "sinks": "Runs inference, collects tensor data, computes metrics, writes CSV reports.",
  "flows": "Loads models -> sets input tensors -> invokes models -> retrieves tensors -> computes metrics -> outputs reports.",
  "anomalies": "Uses internal, protected APIs (_get_ops_details, _get_tensor_details), which are not public but standard in debugging contexts; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs model analysis, metrics collection, and debugging functions using standard and internal APIs. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The reliance on internal APIs is typical for debugging tools but could pose stability risks, not security threats. No network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TensorFlow Lite debugging utility with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores across all reports are consistent with its benign purpose. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2) due to internal API use, which does not constitute malicious activity.",
