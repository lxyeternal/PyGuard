{
  "purpose": "The code implements a TensorFlow Lite Quantization Debugger to analyze and debug quantized models by collecting various metrics and statistics from models and layers, primarily for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (quantized and float models) via file paths or content bytes; accesses tensor details, op details, and dataset generator; retrieves tensor data during model inference.",
  "sinks": "Processes tensor data for metrics calculations; writes layer statistics to CSV files.",
  "flows": "Model files/content are loaded and interpreted; input tensors are set from datasets; models are invoked; tensor details are retrieved; metrics are computed; data flows into CSV output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard model debugging operations. No external network calls or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly handles loading, converting, and interpreting TFLite models, and collecting metrics for debugging. It uses standard Python and TensorFlow APIs, with safe data handling. No indications of malicious behavior such as hidden network communications, code injection, or credential theft. The usage of file paths and model content bytes is typical for model analysis tools. All operations are related to model debugging and statistical analysis without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TensorFlow Lite debugging utility intended for model analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads models and tensor data to produce metrics, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
