  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features like obfuscation and dynamic execution, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The overall security risk is moderate, with potential for misuse if external inputs are untrusted. Malware likelihood remains low but non-negligible due to these features."
