  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear; it appears to import modules and potentially perform some operations, but no specific functionality is evident from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and potentially environment variables or input functions if present; however, no direct input sources are shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file operations, or system commands if used, but no such sinks are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows identified due to the limited code snippet; no untrusted data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are evident from the provided code snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code includes import statements and possibly some initial setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation techniques are detected. Without additional context or runtime behavior, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code looks standard, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected. Confidence is moderate due to limited context, but no immediate threats are evident.",
