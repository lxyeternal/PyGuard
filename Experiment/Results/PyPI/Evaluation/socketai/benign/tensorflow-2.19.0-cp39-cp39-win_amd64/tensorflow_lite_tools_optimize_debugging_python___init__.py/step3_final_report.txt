  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, input functions, dynamic execution points (e.g., eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env) to sinks (network, system commands) via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, dynamic imports, complex control flow, suspicious control structures.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution features and obfuscated segments, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. No confirmed malicious payloads are present, but suspicious patterns suggest potential misuse. Hardcoded secrets and eval/exec increase the risk profile. The code's benign appearance in some parts contrasts with the dynamic and obfuscated features in others, warranting cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features like obfuscation and dynamic execution, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The overall security risk is moderate, with potential for misuse if external inputs are untrusted. Malware likelihood remains low but non-negligible due to these features.",
