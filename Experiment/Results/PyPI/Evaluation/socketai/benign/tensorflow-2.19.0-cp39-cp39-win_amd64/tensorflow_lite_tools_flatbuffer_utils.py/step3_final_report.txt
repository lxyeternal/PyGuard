  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling TensorFlow Lite models, including reading, writing, buffer manipulation, and format conversion.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations, model buffers, operator codes, external file parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted model data buffers, external files, and functions that modify model weights.",
  "flows": "Reading model files -> converting byte arrays to objects -> manipulating buffers or weights -> writing back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hidden network activity or backdoors. Functions like 'randomize_weights' could be misused but are legitimate utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for TensorFlow Lite model processing, including reading from files, converting models to bytearrays, byte swapping for endianness, and randomizing weights. No malicious code, obfuscation, or covert channels are present. The functions are straightforward and well-documented. While some functions could be misused to corrupt models, they are legitimate utilities and do not constitute malicious behavior. External file parsing functions are simple regex-based conversions without malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for TensorFlow Lite models, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight potential for misuse does not elevate the security risk to concerning levels.",
