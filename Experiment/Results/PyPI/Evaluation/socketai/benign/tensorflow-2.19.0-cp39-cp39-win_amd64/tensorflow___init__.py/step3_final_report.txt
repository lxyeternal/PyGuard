  "purpose": "TensorFlow initialization script that imports modules, sets environment variables, and loads libraries for framework setup.",

  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem paths influence dynamic library loading, which could execute external code",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control library loading, dynamic import of external libraries, no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup routine for TensorFlow, importing modules, setting environment variables, and conditionally loading external libraries from filesystem paths. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The dynamic loading mechanisms could be exploited if directories are compromised, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The code structure is clear, and the logic aligns with typical open-source framework initialization. The risk primarily stems from external library loading points, which are common in plugin architectures but can be exploited if environment security is weak.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard TensorFlow initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is external library loading via environment variables and filesystem paths, which is a known attack vector but not malicious by itself. Overall, the code poses a low security risk.",
