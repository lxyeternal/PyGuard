  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-deadline' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description, and uses static data for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script does not execute external commands or handle untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into the 'long_description' variable, then into the setup() function as configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The script is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a markdown file for the description. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, classifiers, and dependencies. All operations are standard for setup scripts. There is no dynamic execution, network communication, or handling of sensitive data. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
