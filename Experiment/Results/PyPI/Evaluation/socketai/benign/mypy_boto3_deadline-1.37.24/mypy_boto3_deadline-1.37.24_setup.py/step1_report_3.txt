{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'mypy-boto3-deadline', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static string data for package metadata; import statements for pathlib and setuptools; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no code writes data to external systems or executes commands based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only reads local files and defines package metadata without dynamic data flow or execution of external code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; all code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a local README file, defines package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed data. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious behaviors are present. All imported modules are standard and safe. The script appears to be a straightforward package setup file with no malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks.",
