{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used for packaging and distributing the Python library 'mypy-boto3-deadline'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description, and uses standard setuptools functions for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no dynamic code execution, network access, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script primarily reads static files and calls setup() with predefined parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for file handling and setuptools for packaging. It reads a markdown file for description and calls setup() with static parameters. All values are hardcoded or derived from local files; no untrusted input or dynamic execution is present. The package metadata appears standard for a Python package distribution. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely.",
