  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'mypy-boto3-deadline' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md for long description; static metadata fields; no untrusted input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future year '2025' in copyright, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious elements. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling are present. The only minor anomaly is the future date, which is likely a placeholder or typo. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and should be maintained.",
