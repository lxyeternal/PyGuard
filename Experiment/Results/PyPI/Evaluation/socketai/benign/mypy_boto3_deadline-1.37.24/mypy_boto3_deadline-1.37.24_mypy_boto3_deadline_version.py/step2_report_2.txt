  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the findings are accurate, consistent, and justified.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, with no external inputs, data flows, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is minimal, static, and standard for version declaration in Python packages.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to current date, but this is not a security concern per se.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward; no issues or malicious behavior are present.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to a variable.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n   - They correctly dismiss any suspicion of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - The mention of the future copyright year is noted as a potential inconsistency but not a security risk.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The anomaly regarding the future year does not warrant an increased security risk score.\n\n4. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as no malicious or obfuscated code is detected.\n   \n5. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score based on the provided code.\n\n6. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - No assumptions are made that go beyond the evidence; all claims are conservative and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** Purely a static version string assignment, typical in Python packages.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** None detected; malware score should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; obfuscated score remains 0.\n- **Security Risk:** No risk identified; remains 0.\n- **Anomaly (Future Year):** Not a security concern but worth noting for consistency or correction.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threats. The assessments are correct, and no adjustments are necessary.",
