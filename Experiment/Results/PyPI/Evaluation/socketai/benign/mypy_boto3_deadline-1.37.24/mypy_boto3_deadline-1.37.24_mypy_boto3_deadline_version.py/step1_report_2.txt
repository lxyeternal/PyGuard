  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as a string",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025) that might be inconsistent or suspicious, but not malicious by itself",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, which is common in Python packages for version control. The only notable aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, potentially indicating an inconsistency or typo. There are no other code elements, no input/output operations, and no security-sensitive actions. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with a potentially inconsistent copyright year. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
