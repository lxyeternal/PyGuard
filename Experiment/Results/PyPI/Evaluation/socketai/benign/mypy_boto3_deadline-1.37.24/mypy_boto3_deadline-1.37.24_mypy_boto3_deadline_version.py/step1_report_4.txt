  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version string with a copyright comment; no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting a version variable with a static string and including a copyright statement. There are no dynamic operations, external inputs, or suspicious behaviors. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. It appears to be a standard version declaration commonly found in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple version reference with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
