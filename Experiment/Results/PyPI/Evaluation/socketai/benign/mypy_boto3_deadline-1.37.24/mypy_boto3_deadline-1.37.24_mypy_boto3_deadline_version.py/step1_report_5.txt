  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version declaration, no suspicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, no external data reading, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The header comment indicates the source of truth for versioning, but does not influence security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely defines a version string without any malicious intent or security risks.",
