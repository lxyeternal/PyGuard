  "flows": "N/A - No data flow or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a version string and a copyright comment; no anomalies or suspicious code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright comment and a single assignment of the version string to a variable. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The version string appears standard and static. No secrets, credentials, or other sensitive information are present. The code is straightforward and minimal, typical for a version declaration in a package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as a metadata component of a larger package without any suspicious or harmful code.",
