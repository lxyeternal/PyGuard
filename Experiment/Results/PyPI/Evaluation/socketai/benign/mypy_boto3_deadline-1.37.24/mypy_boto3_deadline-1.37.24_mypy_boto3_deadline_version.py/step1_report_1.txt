  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no external input sources, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no suspicious code constructs. The purpose appears to be simply maintaining a version identifier.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for version tracking. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
