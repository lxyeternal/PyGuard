  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code itself.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n- The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice with a future year (2025), and a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- There are no external inputs, no dynamic code, no data flows, no obfuscation, and no malicious code present.\n- The purpose is purely to define the package version, a common practice in Python modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, static, and benign. No issues are found in the code itself.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **In the reports:**  \n  - The only notable point is the copyright year \"2025\" which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming 2023). While unusual, this is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n  - No other flaws, errors, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which could be flagged as a potential inconsistency but not a security concern.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is static, contains no external inputs, no dynamic behavior, and no malicious intent, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static version declaration with no security risks or malicious behavior. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
