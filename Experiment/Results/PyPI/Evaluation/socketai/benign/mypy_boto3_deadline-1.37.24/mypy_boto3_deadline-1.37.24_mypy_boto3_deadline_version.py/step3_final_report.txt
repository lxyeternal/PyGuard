  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string.",
  "sources": "Assignment of '__version__' to the string '1.37.24'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs involved.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static string to '__version__' without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year '2025', which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string with a comment and a copyright notice. No dynamic code, external inputs, or suspicious behavior are present. The only anomaly is the future year, which is likely a typo or oversight, not a security concern. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly zero.",
