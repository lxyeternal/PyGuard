{
  "purpose": "Provides interface and dependency imports for the deadline service SDK, including client, paginators, and waiters.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No input sources or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points detected. The code primarily consists of class and function imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is mainly import and export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code appears well-structured and standard for SDK module initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes, functions, and constants from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and defines an alias (Client) and an __all__ list for exports. There are no input data handling, network operations, or execution logic that could be exploited. The content appears consistent with a typical SDK module for AWS-like services, with explicit and descriptive import patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK module setup for the deadline service, solely consisting of imports, aliasing, and exports. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues within this module.",
