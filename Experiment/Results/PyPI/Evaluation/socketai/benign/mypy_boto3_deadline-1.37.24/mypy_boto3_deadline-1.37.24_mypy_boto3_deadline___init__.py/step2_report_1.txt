  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a typical __init__.py for a package, importing classes and functions from local modules and exposing them via __all__. No external or user input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network, file, or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely structural, setting up an API surface for SDK consumers. No malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the import of modules and exposing classes/functions.\n- No external input, no network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- The future date again noted but not malicious.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the import structure and documentation.\n- No data flow, no external connections, no secrets.\n- Standard SDK setup.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes the code as an organized import/export module with extensive documentation.\n- No suspicious activity or data handling.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the import structure and absence of malicious patterns.\n- No external data or network activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily import/export setup, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign SDK scaffolding.\n\n- **Scores suggested?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None needed; the code is purely structural.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static nature of the code.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the code's benign, SDK-structuring purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard SDK __init__.py file with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.**",
