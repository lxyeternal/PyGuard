{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for the boto3 deadline client with type annotations for improved type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method parameters accepting unpacked dicts with specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no use of untrusted data sources, external calls, or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Class wait methods receive **kwargs, unpacked into specific type defs; no data flows to external systems or sensitive data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is primarily type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter, with methods 'wait' accepting unpacked typed kwargs, linked to specific waiters' documentation. The code relies on standard libraries, with conditional imports for compatibility. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall structure suggests a well-structured type annotation extension for boto3 waiters, intended for type safety and clarity, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured module providing type annotations for boto3 waiter classes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is safe and intended for type safety enhancement in a larger codebase.",
