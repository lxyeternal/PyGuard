  "purpose": "Type annotations and custom waiters for Deadline service client in boto3, providing structured wait mechanisms with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and internal type_defs; class method parameters with **kwargs using Unpack of imported type defs.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Method wait() receives **kwargs unpacked from type definitions, with no further data flow or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type: ignore for method overrides, which may be necessary but also could hide issues; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom waiters inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter, with type annotations for their wait methods. It conditionally imports Unpack for Python >=3.12, importing from typing_extensions otherwise. The wait methods accept **kwargs typed with imported type definitions, serving as type-safe placeholders for wait parameters. No data processing, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be standard for type annotation purposes, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Usage of 'type: ignore' is noted but not suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type-annotated implementation of boto3 waiters, with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It serves as a type-safe interface layer for waiters in the Deadline client.",
