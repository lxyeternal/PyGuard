{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiter classes for AWS Deadline service with type annotations for improved static analysis and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, type definitions, and system version info. The 'wait' methods accept **kwargs, unpacked from specific type defs.",
  "sinks": "The 'wait' methods, which could potentially process untrusted data if misused, but in context, they are standard waiters with no explicit untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the 'wait' methods are wrappers over the base 'Waiter' class's 'wait' function, which is not shown to process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code mainly contains class definitions with method signatures and imports. The conditional import of 'Unpack' is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of 'Waiter' with overridden 'wait' methods annotated for type checking. These methods are intended to invoke AWS waiters with specific parameters. The import statements and type definitions are straightforward, aiming for enhanced type safety and documentation. No code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious is evident. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a type-annotated wrapper for AWS waiter classes, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It mainly provides enhanced type safety and documentation support for AWS Deadline waiters.",
