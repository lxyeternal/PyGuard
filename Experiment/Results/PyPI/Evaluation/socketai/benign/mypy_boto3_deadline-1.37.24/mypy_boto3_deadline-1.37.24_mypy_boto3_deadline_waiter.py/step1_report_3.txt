{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations and custom waiters for the Deadline service client in boto3, providing structured wait mechanisms with type hints.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, boto3.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method parameters with **kwargs, and dynamic imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; no network connections, file writes, or credential accesses observed.",
  "flows": "Class wait() methods accept **kwargs with specific type definitions; no data flows outside the method parameters or imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Usage of type annotations and conditional imports are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for waiters extending boto3's Waiter class, with detailed type annotations for method parameters. It imports necessary modules, conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version, and defines multiple waiter classes with identical wait() method signatures. There are no code execution, data processing, or network operations that could indicate malicious activity. The purpose appears to be purely structural, aiding type checking and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 waiters. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware indications are detected. It is a legitimate utility module for type-safe boto3 waiter usage.",
