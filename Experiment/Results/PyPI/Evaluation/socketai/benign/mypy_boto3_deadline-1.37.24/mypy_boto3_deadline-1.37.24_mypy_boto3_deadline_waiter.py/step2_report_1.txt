  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its structure, and the provided assessments.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code defines subclasses of `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, adding type annotations to the `wait()` method.\n- The `wait()` methods accept `**kwargs` unpacked from specific type definitions imported from a local `type_defs` module.\n- The code uses conditional imports for `Unpack` based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- There are no external data sources, network calls, or data processing beyond method signatures.\n- The code appears to be purely for type safety, documentation, and IDE support.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Reports**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** To define custom waiters with type annotations for boto3's Deadline client.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior; the code is well-structured, purely type annotations, no external calls or data leaks.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and custom waiters, similar to above.  \n- **Findings:** Uses `type: ignore` for method overrides, which is sometimes necessary but could hide issues.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity, just standard type annotations with a minor note on `type: ignore`.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar, defining waiters with type annotations.  \n- **Findings:** No code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; benign code.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above.  \n- **Findings:** Slightly higher `securityRisk` score (0.1), but no evidence of actual risk or malicious activity.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (possibly conservative, but acceptable given the context)  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly overcautious but not unreasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same purpose—type annotations for waiters.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks, no external data handling.  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions, with no executable logic beyond method signatures.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low, with some conservative adjustments (e.g., report 4's 0.1) being acceptable.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is safe.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is purely structural/type annotations.\n\nThis module appears to be a well-structured, safe extension for type safety in boto3 waiters, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, serving solely as a type-annotated interface for boto3 waiters. No changes to scores are necessary.",
