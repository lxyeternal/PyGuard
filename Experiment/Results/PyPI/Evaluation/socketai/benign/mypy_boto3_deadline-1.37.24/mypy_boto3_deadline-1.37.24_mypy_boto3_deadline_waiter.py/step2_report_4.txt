  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines subclasses of `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, adding type annotations for their `wait()` methods.\n- The `wait()` methods accept `**kwargs` unpacked from specific type definitions imported from `type_defs`.\n- No data processing, external network calls, or sensitive operations are present.\n- Use of `type: ignore` for method override compatibility is standard practice.\n- Conditional import of `Unpack` based on Python version is appropriate.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be providing type safety and documentation support for boto3 waiters.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-report analysis:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear, aligns with the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, purely for type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.0 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `type: ignore`—common in such cases.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward type annotations, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard type annotations, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Slightly higher `securityRisk` score (0.1) possibly due to cautious reporting.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code; the risk score might be slightly overcautious but still acceptable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0 — **reasonable**.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior. The small security risk score can be justified as a conservative estimate, but overall, it's benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Serves as a type safety wrapper, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports are transparent.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, as the code is purely for type annotations and class definitions, with no external or dangerous operations.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (safe, with no security risk evident)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for boto3 waiters. No suspicious or malicious elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe.",
