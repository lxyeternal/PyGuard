  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom waiters with type annotations for boto3 Deadline client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter, with wait methods accepting **kwargs typed via imported type definitions. The code is straightforward, mainly for type safety.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions, with no signs of malware or security risks. The use of 'type: ignore' is standard for method override compatibility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on type annotations and custom waiters.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'type: ignore' in method overrides, which could hide issues but is common in such cases.\n- **Analysis:** No external calls, data processing, or suspicious logic. The code is a standard extension for type safety.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears to be a standard type-annotated extension, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines waiters with type annotations, conditional import of Unpack.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** Class definitions extend botocore.waiter.Waiter, with no external or unsafe operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, safe, no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Clear, straightforward, and intended for type safety.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar class definitions with type annotations.\n- **Anomalies:** Slightly higher 'securityRisk' score (0.1), but no evidence of actual risk.\n- **Analysis:** No data leaks, network activity, or code execution. The purpose is documentation and type safety.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The small security risk score may be a conservative placeholder; the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and class wrappers, no untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Functions are wrappers with no data processing or external calls.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, intended for type safety.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** **None**. All reports describe type annotations and class structures for boto3 waiters.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risks:** Very low, mostly related to the use of 'type: ignore' (which is standard practice here).\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay at 0 or very close to it, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a well-structured, type-annotated extension for boto3 waiters, aimed at improving type safety and documentation. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is evident. The security risk is negligible, and the existing scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
