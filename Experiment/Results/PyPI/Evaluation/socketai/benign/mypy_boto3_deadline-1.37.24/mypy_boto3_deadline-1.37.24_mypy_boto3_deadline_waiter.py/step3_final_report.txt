  "purpose": "Define subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter with type annotations for various boto3 Deadline waiters to enhance type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Method calls to self, **kwargs unpacked from imported type definitions in type_defs module.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network calls, or data leaks; purely class and method signatures.",
  "flows": "wait() method receives kwargs unpacked from specific type definitions; no data flows outside class scope.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'type: ignore' in method overrides, conditional import of Unpack based on Python version, but these are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of botocore.waiter.Waiter, adding type annotations to the wait() methods. It uses conditional imports for compatibility and includes detailed documentation links. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is solely to provide type safety and improve IDE support. The use of 'type: ignore' is common in such override scenarios. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, type-annotated extension for boto3 waiters related to the Deadline service. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate.",
