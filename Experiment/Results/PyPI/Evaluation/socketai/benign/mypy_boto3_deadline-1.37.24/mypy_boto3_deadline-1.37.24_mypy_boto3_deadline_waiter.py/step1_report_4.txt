{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for the Deadline service client in boto3, providing structured waiters for various resource states.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class method signatures using unpacked kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The wait methods accept kwargs with specific type definitions, but do not process or execute external commands or data.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into the wait() methods; no data is transformed or sent externally; the class hierarchy relies on the inherited Waiter class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. No code execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple waiter subclasses for boto3, with type annotations for the wait() method parameters. The class structure and comments reference official documentation. No external data processing, file operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The imports and type definitions are standard for type hinting. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented set of waiter class definitions for boto3, with no malicious or suspicious elements identified. It primarily provides type annotations and class structures for better type safety and documentation.",
