  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential vulnerabilities, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a type-annotated SDK wrapper for boto3's Deadline Cloud client, including method signatures, overloads, and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data exfiltration, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The methods are primarily signatures with type hints.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code appears auto-generated or boilerplate, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only unusual element is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this isn't malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is benign and intended for static typing support is accurate. The malware score of 0 is justified, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (appropriate, minimal risk from SDK stub code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that this is a type stub/interface for AWS Deadline.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or external data handling; only method signatures and type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is auto-generated, with no signs of malicious activity. The extensive overloads are standard for boto3 stubs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as benign, safe, and purely for static type checking.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on the static nature of the code, mainly type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or runtime logic; no external data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Auto-generated stub code with no malicious intent. The future year 2025 in copyright is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a benign static interface is accurate.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (safe)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the class as a type-annotated boto3 client subclass.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic, no external data handling, only method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of overloads is standard for type safety.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard interface with no malicious elements.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, typical SDK stub code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, focusing on type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks or malicious flows; methods are signatures for API calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate that this is a benign, type-focused SDK interface.\n\n**Score suggestion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (safe)\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious behavior. The code is static, type annotations, and interface definitions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all code appears straightforward and auto-generated.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, as this is SDK stub code with no runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling.\n\n### Final justification:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, auto-generated type stub for AWS boto3's Deadline client.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.\n- The extensive overloads and type annotations are standard for static type support, not malicious obfuscation.\n- The future year in the copyright is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to SDK stub code, not active code)\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and intended solely for static type checking and IDE support. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
