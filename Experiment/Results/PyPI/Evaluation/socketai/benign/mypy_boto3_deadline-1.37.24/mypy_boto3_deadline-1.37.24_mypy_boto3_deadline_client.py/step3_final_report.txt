{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 Deadline Cloud client, providing method signatures, overloads, and exception handling for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, overloads, and type imports; no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data exfiltration, network calls, or malicious sinks; purely static interface definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; method signatures invoke AWS APIs via boto3, which is standard and safe.",
  "anomalies": "Auto-generated style, extensive overloads, no secrets or obfuscation; future-dated copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated SDK stub with extensive type annotations and overloads for IDE support. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external data flows. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only anomaly is the future year in the copyright, which is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and justified by its static, interface-only design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface for AWS boto3's Deadline client, with no malicious or sabotage elements. It is safe, transparent, and intended solely for static type checking and IDE support.",
