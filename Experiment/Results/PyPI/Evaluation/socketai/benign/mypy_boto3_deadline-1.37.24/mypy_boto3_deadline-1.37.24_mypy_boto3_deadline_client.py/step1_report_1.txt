{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 Deadline Cloud client, including methods, properties, and paginator/waiter overloads.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method definitions with parameters and return types; overloads for paginators and waiters.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that could potentially send data over the network (e.g., generate_presigned_url), but are standard boto3 client methods. No explicit data leakage or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Method calls with parameters unpacked from type defs, leading to network requests or AWS credential handling via standard boto3 methods. No suspicious flows or external data exfiltration paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code is mainly boilerplate and method definitions consistent with boto3 client structure. No signs of obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical boto3 client class with extensive type annotations and overloads for paginator and waiter methods. All methods and imports are standard for SDK wrappers, with no dynamic code execution, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs. The presence of extensive overloads and type hints indicates an emphasis on type safety, not malicious intent. No anomalous or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper for AWS Deadline Cloud services with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It mainly provides method signatures, type annotations, and overloads to facilitate type-safe AWS API calls.",
