  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the Deadline service in boto3, providing type hints and method signatures for interacting with the API.",
  "sources": "The module imports, class definitions, method definitions, and property accessors within the DeadlineCloudClient class.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that call external AWS services via boto3, primarily through method signatures with parameters unpacked from request type definitions, and return type annotations. No actual data processing or external data flows are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Function signatures with parameters unpacked from request type definitions, returning either dictionaries or specific response type definitions, indicating the data flow from input parameters to output responses. No execution or runtime data flow logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly declarative, providing type hints and method signatures; no execution logic, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are evident. The get_paginator and get_waiter overloads define type-specific return types, which is standard for boto3 stub implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a type stub and interface for the boto3 Deadline client, with method signatures that match AWS API calls. It includes overloads for get_paginator and get_waiter to provide precise type hints for various operation names and waiter types. No runtime logic, dynamic code execution, or external data flows that could indicate malicious behavior are present. The code adheres to typical boto3 stub patterns, focusing on type safety and API interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type declaration and client interface for the boto3 Deadline service, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily provides type annotations for AWS API interactions. Therefore, it can be considered safe and benign.",
