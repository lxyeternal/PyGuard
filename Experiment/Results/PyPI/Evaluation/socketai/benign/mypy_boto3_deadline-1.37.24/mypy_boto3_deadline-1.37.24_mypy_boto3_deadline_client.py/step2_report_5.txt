  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code presence, logic, potential vulnerabilities, malicious indicators, and score justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard SDK wrapper with extensive type annotations, no suspicious behavior, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is mainly boilerplate, with no runtime logic or external data flows that could be malicious. The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1), given the code is a static interface.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a static, type-annotated interface with no runtime logic or external data flows.\n- **Assessment:** The code is auto-generated stub code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** Perfect (1.0), justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, benign, and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code as static type annotations and interface definitions, with no runtime logic or data exfiltration.\n- **Assessment:** The extensive overloads and type hints are typical for SDK stubs. No malicious patterns are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard stub code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code as a strict interface with no suspicious code, network calls, or backdoors.\n- **Assessment:** The focus is on the code being purely interface/type annotations, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—type annotations, no runtime logic, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely declarative, matching standard boto3 client patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, fitting.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK interface.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is static, mainly type annotations, method signatures, overloads, and interface definitions.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious sinks, data exfiltration points, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code is a stub/wrapper for AWS SDK calls, which inherently involve network operations and credential handling, but nothing in this code indicates insecure or malicious behavior—it's a static interface.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The scores for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are consistent across all reports and justified.\n- The security risk remains very low, given the code's nature.\n- The high confidence scores are justified by the detailed, consistent analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, auto-generated SDK stubs.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly because the code interacts with external services, but no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, static SDK interface with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
