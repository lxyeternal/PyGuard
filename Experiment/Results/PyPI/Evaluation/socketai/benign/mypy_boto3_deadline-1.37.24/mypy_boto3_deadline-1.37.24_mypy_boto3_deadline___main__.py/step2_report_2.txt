  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that displays package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It uses only standard library modules (`sys`), with no external dependencies, dynamic code, or network activity.\n- The code is straightforward, with static strings and simple control flow.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity Checks:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior. This matches the code's structure and content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a simple CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores and Logic:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. No vulnerabilities or security risks are evident.\n\n- **Confidence level:**  \n  All reports have full confidence (1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n- No issues detected or claimed that could elevate the risk score.\n- No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a benign CLI script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports. The code is a simple, safe CLI utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is straightforward, static, and performs only informational output. No suspicious patterns, no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. All evidence points to a benign utility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No changes needed.",
