  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and only outputs static information.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input beyond command-line arguments.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info or version, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly interpret the code's behavior and scope.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malware:**\n   - Since the code only outputs static information and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, the malware score remains at 0.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is straightforward.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script for displaying package info.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a simple informational CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is safe.",
