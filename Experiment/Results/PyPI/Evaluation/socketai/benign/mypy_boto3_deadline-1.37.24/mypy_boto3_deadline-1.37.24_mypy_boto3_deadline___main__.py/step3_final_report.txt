{
  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that displays package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; outputs static strings via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are static; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) leading to static output functions; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses only standard library functions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal logic: it checks for '--version' in sys.argv and prints version info; otherwise, it prints package info. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input beyond argument checking. The code is static, simple, and transparent, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
