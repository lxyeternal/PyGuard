  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes output to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument; if present, calls print_version() which outputs version info, else calls print_info() which outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward CLI logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version number based on command-line input. It uses sys.argv to determine behavior and sys.stdout.write for output. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated or complex logic. The comments and code purpose align with standard CLI scripts for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
