  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package that provides informational output about package details and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output, static string literals containing package info and version.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, reading sys.argv for input commands.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() output; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious intent detected. Code is straightforward and uses standard Python functions.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a simple CLI utility that outputs package metadata or version info based on command-line input. It imports only sys, uses no external or dynamic inputs beyond command-line args, and does not execute or load untrusted code. The static strings are normal informational messages. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a straightforward script with no security concerns.",
