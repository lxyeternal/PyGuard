  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point for a package that provides information about boto3 DeadlineCloud, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to stdout; no untrusted data is received from external sources or user input beyond command-line args. No other sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The script checks for '--version' in command-line arguments (source) and conditionally outputs version info or package info (sink).",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs straightforward informational printing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or include third-party library calls other than standard sys module. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that provides package information with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It operates solely on static data and standard input/output streams.",
