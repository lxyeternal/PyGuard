{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in sys.argv, calls print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, calls print_info() which writes package details to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard library functions is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The script defines two functions to print package info and version, then a main function that checks command-line arguments and calls the appropriate print function. The code uses standard sys and string output functions with no external input or network activity. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code is present. The script appears to be a straightforward CLI tool for displaying package information, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that outputs package info or version based on user input. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. It is a simple utility script with no indications of compromise.",
