  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a simple CLI utility that displays package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It uses only standard library modules (`sys`), reads `sys.argv`, and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n- The output is static, hardcoded information.\n- No external inputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None detected. The code functions as intended, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware presence:** None. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None. The code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None. The script is a benign informational CLI.\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a benign, straightforward CLI utility.\n- They correctly identify the lack of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious activity.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is static, has no external dependencies, and performs only informational output, the risk score should remain **0**.\n- No reason to assign a higher score unless there was hidden malicious code or dynamic behavior, which there isn't.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\nBased on the analysis, the code is a benign CLI utility with no security issues. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and no further action is necessary.",
