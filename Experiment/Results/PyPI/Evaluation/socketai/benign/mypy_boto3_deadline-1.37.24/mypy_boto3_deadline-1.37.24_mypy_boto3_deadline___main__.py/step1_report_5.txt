  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package that outputs package info and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) to determine behavior.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout (sys.stdout.write) based on input arguments.",
  "flows": "User provides command-line arguments; if '--version' is present, calls print_version() to output version info; otherwise, calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and solely outputs static information based on user input.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print static package info and version. The main() function checks for '--version' argument to determine output. The script is a standard CLI pattern without dynamic code execution, external network access, or data leakage mechanisms. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected. The logic is simple, with no input validation concerns or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
