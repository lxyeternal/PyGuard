  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's security implications, correctness, and consistency with best practices.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that this is a static type definition module for AWS Deadline SDK, with no runtime logic.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely static type annotations, used for type safety and documentation, with no runtime or executable code.  \n- **Security Implication:** Zero; no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** No security risk, malware, or obfuscation detected. The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no substantive analysis provided.  \n- **Security assessment:** Insufficient data, but given the absence of code, no malicious activity can be inferred.  \n- **Verdict:** No evidence of malicious code or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on data schemas for AWS Deadline SDK.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Data flows are from external inputs into data structures, but no active processing or handling logic.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely static data schema definitions, with no runtime logic or code execution.  \n- **Security Implication:** No signs of malicious activity; these are type annotations for data validation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0.0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95 (high, but slightly less than perfect due to the general nature of static analysis)\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior or security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no analysis provided.  \n- **Security assessment:** No data to evaluate, but no signs of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- All reports (1, 3, 4) correctly identify that the code is static type definitions, with no runtime or executable logic.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n- The code is standard for SDK schema definitions, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- The malware score should be **0.0** across the board, consistent with the static nature.\n- The obfuscated score is **0.0**, as no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The security risk is **0.0**; no active data handling, no credentials, no network activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis source code is a benign, purely static schema definition module with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Work-through reasoning:**\n- The code contains only type annotations, class definitions, and constants.\n- No runtime code, data handling, or external data ingestion.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type safety and API schema validation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities. The initial reports correctly identify the static, schema-only nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such static schema files are maintained properly, but they inherently pose no security threat.",
