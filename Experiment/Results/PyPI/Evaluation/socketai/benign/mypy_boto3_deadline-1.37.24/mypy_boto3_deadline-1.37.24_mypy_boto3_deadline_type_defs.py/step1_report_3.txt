  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS Deadline service SDK, facilitating data validation and structured communication between components.",
  "sources": "Most source data is received via function parameters, API responses, environment variables, and external inputs (e.g., network, user). The code defines data schemas but does not include explicit data ingestion or handling logic.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows into data structures via function arguments or API responses, notably in fields like 'parameters', 'tags', 'environmentId', 'jobId', 'sessionId', and 'queueId'. These are mostly used for serialization/deserialization and do not by themselves perform data handling operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (API responses, parameters, environment variables) into these structured types. No active processing, command execution, or data handling logic is present. The code strictly defines data schemas, which are used downstream by other components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code strictly adheres to type definitions and data schema declarations. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The entire code consists of Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, Union types, and import statements for type checking. It defines data structures used for serialization and validation in a cloud SDK context. There are no functions, executable code, or logic that could be exploited maliciously. All data fields are standard for cloud resource configuration, status reporting, and request/response schemas. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoor logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of data schema definitions intended for type checking and validation in a Python SDK for AWS Deadline. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or handling of untrusted data streams within this fragment. Therefore, it does not exhibit any malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors.",
