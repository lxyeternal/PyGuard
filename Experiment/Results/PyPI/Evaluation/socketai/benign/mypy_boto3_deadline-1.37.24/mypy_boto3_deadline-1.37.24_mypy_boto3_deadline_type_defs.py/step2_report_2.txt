  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the security implications, consistency of scores, and potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external data sources. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as a benign schema definition module.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues here. The type definitions are standard, and the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The response is empty; no analysis provided.\n- **Scores:** No scores assigned, just an \"error\" note.\n- **Assessment:** Since there's no content, no security concern arises from this report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code is only type annotations and data schemas, with no executable logic or data handling. It notes potential data flows from external sources but clarifies that these are used for serialization/deserialization, not active processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or attack vectors detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, confirming that the code is only type annotations and data schemas, with no runtime or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Empty response, no analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is a comprehensive set of Python `TypedDict`, `Union`, and type alias definitions for AWS Deadline SDK data schemas. It includes conditional imports for compatibility, but no executable logic, data processing, or runtime code.\n- **Potential Risks:** Since it contains only static type annotations, it does not perform any data handling, network communication, or command execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Data Flows:** External data (e.g., API responses, user input) flows into these schemas but only for validation and serialization, which is standard and safe.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** No obfuscation or malware signatures are detected. The use of standard typing and schema definitions is typical for SDKs and type safety modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Security Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — Clear, standard type definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — No security risk or attack vector identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is purely static type definitions used for type safety and API schema validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Based on the entire review, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: static, schema-only code with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the actual runtime code interacting with these schemas is reviewed separately for security issues.
