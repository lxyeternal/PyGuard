  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the boto3_deadline SDK, facilitating type safety and clarity in AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard library modules (sys, datetime, typing) and local modules; variable assignments including TypedDict definitions and class declarations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; data structures are used for type annotations and API schema definitions, not for executing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; primarily static type definitions with no dynamic data flows or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No unusual code behavior, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code present. Use of type annotations and data structures aligns with typical SDK type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises only type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, imports, and module-level constants. It strictly defines data schemas for AWS SDK interactions with no runtime logic, user input handling, or network operations. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present. The use of standard Python typing and type definitions aligns with SDK documentation and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely structural, serving as type annotations for an SDK's API schema. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, safe set of type definitions for type safety in Python.",
