{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS-specific data structures used in boto3_stubs for the Deadline service, facilitating type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from __future__, sys, datetime, typing, and local module literals; various class and variable definitions for TypedDict structures and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling; primarily static type definitions with no runtime data processing or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code strictly defines data schemas and type annotations without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. Usage of type annotations and data schemas is standard and benign. No obfuscated or misleading code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises only type definitions using TypedDict and Union, with conditional imports for compatibility. It imports no runtime code execution, external data fetching, or side-effect-causing operations. The structure is consistent with standard type annotation files for API schema definition. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a collection of type definitions for data schemas used in the boto3 boto3_stubs package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a purely static, schema-definition module for type safety and documentation, containing no malicious behavior.",
