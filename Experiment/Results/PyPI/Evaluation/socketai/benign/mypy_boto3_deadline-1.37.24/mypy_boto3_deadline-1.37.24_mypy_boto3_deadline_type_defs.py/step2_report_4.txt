  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the code's structure, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear that these are static type definitions for AWS Deadline SDK, intended for type safety.\n- **Flow & Sinks:** No runtime data handling; purely static schema definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a standard type schema module with no security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly identifies the code as a benign static type definition file. The absence of executable code or dynamic data handling indicates zero malware or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- **Implication:** No data to analyze; cannot determine any security concern.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo information provided; no analysis possible. No suspicion or risk indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining data schemas for AWS Deadline SDK.\n- **Potential Data Flows:** The report notes that some fields (e.g., 'parameters', 'tags', 'environmentId', etc.) may receive untrusted data from external sources, such as API responses or user input.\n- **Analysis:** Emphasizes that these are data schemas, not processing logic, and no active handling occurs within this code fragment.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Recognizes that these are data definitions used downstream.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior; purely static schema definitions.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is an accurate, cautious assessment. The code only defines data schemas and does not process data at runtime, so the potential for malicious activity is minimal. The mention of untrusted data entering these schemas is standard in SDK code and does not imply vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" again, with no further info.\n- **Implication:** No data to evaluate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo analysis possible; no concerns raised.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** Entirely composed of static type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility. No functions, no runtime logic, no data processing, and no external data fetching.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security Risks:** None evident. The code is a schema/typing module for API data structures, which is standard and safe.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a static type schema for the AWS Deadline SDK, used for type checking and documentation.\n- It does not execute any logic, handle untrusted data directly, or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- The imports and definitions are standard for type annotations and do not pose security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0-1) | Rationale                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**      | **0.0**     | No executable code, no malicious payloads, no obfuscation.                                    |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0.0**     | Clear, readable type definitions; no obfuscation detected.                                   |\n| **Risk**         | **0.0**     | Static schema definitions pose no security risk; no dynamic or runtime code present.        |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a collection of static type definitions for AWS Deadline SDK, primarily for type safety and documentation.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The reports' assessments are consistent with this conclusion.\n\n**Final note:** I concur with the provided analyses. The source code is benign, purely static, and designed for type checking, with no malicious or security risks involved.",
