{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS Deadline service, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method parameters and internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs) which are unpacked into the request types; no other sinks or external data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (kwargs) flows into the paginate methods, which then generate paginated responses; no external data exfiltration, system modifications, or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code primarily consists of class definitions and type annotations, following standard patterns. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains class definitions for paginators with method signatures matching boto3 documentation. All imports are standard or type-related, and no runtime code executes untrusted operations. The structure adheres to typical boto3 stub patterns. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, file modifications, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated type stub for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It solely provides type annotations and class scaffolding for safe pagination handling in AWS SDKs.",
