{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the Deadline service client in boto3, providing type safety and structured pagination.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from method parameters (via **kwargs) in the paginate methods; imports type definitions and standard libraries; uses sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks like network connections, file writes, or command executions are present. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution found.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating paginator classes that extend base Paginator classes, with paginate methods that accept untrusted parameters via **kwargs. These parameters flow into the pagination logic but are just type hints; no actual data processing or injection occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is highly structured, type-focused, and standard for boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for paginators, leveraging type annotations and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It uses 'Unpack' from typing_extensions for Python < 3.12 and 'Unpack' from typing for >= 3.12. The classes override the 'paginate' method, accepting kwargs with specific type hints, and return PageIterator objects. All imports and class structures are consistent with a type-safe API extension. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, network activity, or system manipulation. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate type-checked pagination in boto3, with no dynamic or unsafe behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of boto3 paginator type definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly provides type annotations and class structures for pagination, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
