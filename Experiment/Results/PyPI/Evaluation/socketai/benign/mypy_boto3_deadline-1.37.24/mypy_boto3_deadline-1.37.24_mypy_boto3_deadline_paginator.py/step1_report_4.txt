{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the Deadline service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs; class methods calling self and unpacking kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods use **kwargs unpacked with 'Unpack' type, which could potentially be manipulated input, but as they delegate to the underlying boto3 Paginator, no direct untrusted source handling is evident.",
  "flows": "User calls 'paginate' with kwargs, which are unpacked into the boto3 paginator's method, returning a PageIterator.",
  "anomalies": "The code is highly structured, auto-generated, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No unusual code patterns, no dynamic execution, and no network activity or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a series of paginator classes for various API endpoints, leveraging type annotations and conditional imports. It follows a pattern with 'paginate' methods that delegate to underlying boto3 Paginator instances, using 'Unpack' for type safety. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are present. The import statements, class definitions, and method implementations are all standard and consistent with auto-generated SDK bindings. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, auto-generated SDK paginator definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data collection, or unsafe operations outside of delegating to boto3's paginators. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2 (negligible).",
