  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that the code provides type annotations and paginator classes for boto3's Deadline service, with standard imports and class structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The **kwargs** are unpacked into request types but are only type hints; no actual data processing or external operations occur.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is typical for auto-generated boto3 stubs.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully benign, purely for type safety and IDE support.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Risk: 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar observations: class definitions for paginators, no runtime operations, no external data leaks, no malicious code.\n- The detailed analysis confirms the code is boilerplate for type annotations.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, the pattern is consistent: type annotations, class scaffolding, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- The code's purpose is to facilitate static type checking, not runtime behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- The code involves **kwargs** unpacking into boto3 paginator calls, but only as type hints; no actual data manipulation or external effects.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The risk score is noted as 0.2, which is slightly above zero but still very low, reflecting negligible risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with a focus on type annotations and paginator class definitions.\n- No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- The risk score is 0.1, which is very low and appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports describe auto-generated, type-annotated boto3 paginator classes.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, malicious code, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n  - Risk scores are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the negligible chance of malicious intent, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** ~0.05 — extremely low, just acknowledging the use of **kwargs** which could be manipulated but in this context pose no threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, auto-generated set of boto3 paginator type definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent, accurate, and the scores are justified.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is safe, purely for static type checking, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
