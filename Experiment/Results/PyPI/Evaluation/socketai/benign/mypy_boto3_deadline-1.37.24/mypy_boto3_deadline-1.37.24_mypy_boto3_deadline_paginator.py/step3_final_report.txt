{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3's Deadline service, facilitating static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via method parameters (kwargs) used as type hints for pagination requests.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or external data flows; the code only defines classes and methods with type annotations.",
  "flows": "The 'kwargs' are unpacked into paginator methods, serving as interface definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present; the code is standard auto-generated SDK scaffolding.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of auto-generated paginator classes for boto3's Deadline service, with type annotations for request and response types. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, defines classes with 'paginate' methods accepting kwargs, and inherits from boto3's Paginator. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The purpose is solely to support static type checking and IDE features, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK stub code for boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with its nature.",
