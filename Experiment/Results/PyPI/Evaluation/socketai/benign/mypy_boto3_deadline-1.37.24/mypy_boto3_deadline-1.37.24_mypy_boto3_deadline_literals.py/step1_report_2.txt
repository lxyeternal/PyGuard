  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in boto3 deadline service for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Import of 'sys' module to determine Python version; type annotations for literals, mostly from hardcoded string lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sources; literals are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only declares type literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types; no dynamic execution, code injection, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then declares numerous type aliases as string literals. These literals are used for type safety in other code modules. The entire file is static, with no runtime or external input processing. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The purpose is documentation and static typing support.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely provides static type annotations for various enumerations used in boto3 deadline services. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It is a safe, static configuration file for type hinting.",
