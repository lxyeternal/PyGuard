  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a static set of type literal definitions for AWS service identifiers, statuses, and options. No dynamic code, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (or lower). Given the code's nature, these are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines type annotations for string literals used in boto3 for static type checking. No external input or dynamic behavior.\n- **Findings:** Accurate assessment that the code is static, purely declarative, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 or less. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—type annotations for AWS SDK string literals, no runtime or external data.\n- **Findings:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior, no data flow, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 or less. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines type literals for boto3 AWS resource identifiers, no dynamic code or external data.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, purely static definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 or less. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides type annotations for AWS service identifiers, with conditional import for Python version compatibility. No runtime or external data.\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 or less. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions for literals.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All scores are zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Reasonableness of scores:** The scores are consistent and appropriate for this type of code.\n- **Potential concerns:** None. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (since it's purely static type definitions with no external effects or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign set of type alias definitions for static type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. No further action needed.",
