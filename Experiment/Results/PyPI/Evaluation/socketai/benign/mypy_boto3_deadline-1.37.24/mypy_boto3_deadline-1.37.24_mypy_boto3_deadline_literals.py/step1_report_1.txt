{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS service identifiers, statuses, and options used in type annotations for boto3-stub code.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and static definitions of Literal types.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data or external effects; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; code simply assigns literal types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior detected. The code only defines type aliases.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of type alias definitions using Literal for various string constants representing AWS service names, statuses, and options. It includes a conditional import for compatibility with Python 3.12+ but no dynamic execution, external data handling, or malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose appears to be type safety for a boto3 stub library. There are no suspicious or malicious code constructs, no network activity, no data manipulation beyond type annotations, and no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type alias definitions for use in type hinting in a boto3 stub library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
