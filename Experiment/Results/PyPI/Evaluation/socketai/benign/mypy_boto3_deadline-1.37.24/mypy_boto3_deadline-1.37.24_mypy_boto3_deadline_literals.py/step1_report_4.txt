  "purpose": "To define type annotations for various string literal types used in the boto3_deadline package, facilitating type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module to check Python version; type annotations defined as Literal types with string constants.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data input/output or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Type annotations are assigned directly as constants; no dynamic data flow, user input, or external data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code primarily defines constants for type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It then declares numerous string literal types for various AWS resource identifiers and operation names. These declarations serve as type hints for other modules and do not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The code is purely declarative, defining constants for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for string literals, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a safe, static configuration used for type safety in a larger codebase.",
