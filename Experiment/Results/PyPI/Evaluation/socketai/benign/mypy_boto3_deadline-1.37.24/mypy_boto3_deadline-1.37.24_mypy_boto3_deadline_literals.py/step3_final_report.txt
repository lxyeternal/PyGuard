  "purpose": "Defines static type aliases for AWS service identifiers, statuses, and options using Literal types for static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it consists solely of static type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code is purely declarative with no runtime execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with conditional import for Python version compatibility, but no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of Literal type aliases for AWS resource names, statuses, and options. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or executable logic. The purpose is to support static type checking and IDE autocompletion. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard for type stub libraries and is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
