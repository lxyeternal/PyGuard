  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal types used in AWS SDKs for boto3, facilitating static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables of type Literal[], imported from typing and typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input or perform data handling that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or input processing present; purely type annotation definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward type alias declarations with no unusual patterns or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple string literal types for use as type annotations in a Python project. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. All definitions are static assignments of string literals to type aliases, with no input/output or runtime logic. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is purely for static type checking support, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module providing type annotations for AWS SDK string literals. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, serving only as type hints. No anomalies or malicious activity detected.",
