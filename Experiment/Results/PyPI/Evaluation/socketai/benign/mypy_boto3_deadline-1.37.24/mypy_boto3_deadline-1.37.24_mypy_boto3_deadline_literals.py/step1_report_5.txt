{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various AWS service identifiers used in boto3 stubs, enabling type checking and IDE autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions assigned directly to variables; import statements for 'sys' and conditional import for 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, no use of external or user input data, no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward static type annotations. The import conditionally loads 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various string literal types, facilitating type safety in boto3 stubs. It includes a conditional import for compatibility across Python versions (3.12+ vs earlier). No code execution, input/output, or data manipulation occurs. The large list of string literals appears to be curated service identifiers, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining string literal types for AWS service identifiers used in boto3 type hints. It is well-structured, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected. It is purely for type annotation purposes.",
