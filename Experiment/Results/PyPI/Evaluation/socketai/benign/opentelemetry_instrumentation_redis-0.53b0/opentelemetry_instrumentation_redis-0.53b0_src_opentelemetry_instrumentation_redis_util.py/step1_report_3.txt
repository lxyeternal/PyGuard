  "sinks": "span.set_attribute calls in _set_span_attribute_if_value, potential log or output of formatted commands in _format_command_args.",
  "flows": "conn_kwargs -> _extract_conn_attributes -> span.set_attribute; args -> _format_command_args; values -> _value_or_none.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns, no network operations or data leaks. Code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to extract connection attributes, format command arguments, and set span attributes for telemetry purposes. It uses data from dictionaries and lists, with simple logic and no external system interactions. The functions do not perform any network operations, file system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be standard for tracing instrumentation with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely for telemetry instrumentation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured utility code with no suspicious activities detected.",
