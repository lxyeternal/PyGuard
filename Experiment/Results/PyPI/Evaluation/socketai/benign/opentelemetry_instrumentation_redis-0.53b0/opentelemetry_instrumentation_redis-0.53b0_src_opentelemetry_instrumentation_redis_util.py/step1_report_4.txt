  "purpose": "Utility functions for transforming Redis connection info and command arguments for tracing and span attributes in OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "conn_kwargs parameter in _extract_conn_attributes, args parameter in _format_command_args, span object in _set_span_attribute_if_value, values list in _value_or_none",
  "sinks": "span.set_attribute method, which writes attributes for tracing spans",
  "flows": "conn_kwargs and args are used to generate span attributes; values are retrieved and potentially set as span attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code found. The code appears to be standard utility functions for telemetry purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for processing Redis connection parameters and command arguments, mainly for telemetry. It extracts connection attributes, sanitizes command arguments, and conditionally sets span attributes. The functions only process input data and assign values to tracing span attributes without any network activity or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hidden data leaks or malicious code execution, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as telemetry utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs data formatting and span attribute setting for monitoring purposes, with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
