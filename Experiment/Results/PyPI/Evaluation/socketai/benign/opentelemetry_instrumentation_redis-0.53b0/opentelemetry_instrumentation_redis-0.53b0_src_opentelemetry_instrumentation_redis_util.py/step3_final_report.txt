  "purpose": "Utility functions for Redis connection attribute extraction and command argument formatting used in telemetry and tracing.",
  "sources": "conn_kwargs dictionary for connection info; args list for command arguments",
  "sinks": "None; data is processed internally for telemetry attributes and formatting",
  "flows": "Input data from conn_kwargs and args is transformed into trace attributes and formatted strings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for telemetry utilities",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions that process input data for tracing purposes. It extracts connection attributes, formats command arguments with length constraints, and sets span attributes if values are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system interaction. The functions handle data safely and do not perform any network or file operations. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for telemetry instrumentation, with no suspicious patterns or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for telemetry purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The initial high risk score (0.9) in Report 1 is overly conservative; a more appropriate risk score is around 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
