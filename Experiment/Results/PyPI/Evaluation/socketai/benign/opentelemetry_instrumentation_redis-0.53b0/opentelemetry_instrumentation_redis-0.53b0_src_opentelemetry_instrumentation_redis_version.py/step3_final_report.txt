  "sinks": "None; no data input or output points.",
  "flows": "None; static code with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard licensing comments and version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single assignment of a version string. No logic, data processing, external data sources, or dynamic code are present. The code is typical for package metadata, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is straightforward and standard, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard metadata snippet with no security concerns. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
