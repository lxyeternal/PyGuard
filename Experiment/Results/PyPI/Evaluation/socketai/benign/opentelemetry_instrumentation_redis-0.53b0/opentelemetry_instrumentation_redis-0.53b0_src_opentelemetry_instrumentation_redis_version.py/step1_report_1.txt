  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; it is a standard license header and version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a version string assignment. There are no code constructs, data processing, or logic that could be malicious. The presence of licensing comments and version info is typical for open-source packages. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
