  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, specifically defining the package version.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data flows to sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal and standard declaration of the package version, including licensing comments. It does not contain any logic, input handling, or external interactions. It appears to be part of a larger package setup but by itself, it is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package metadata snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
