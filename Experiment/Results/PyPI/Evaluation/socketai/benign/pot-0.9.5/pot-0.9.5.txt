      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for building a Python package with Cython/C++ extensions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The subprocess calls and environment modifications are typical in such contexts and do not indicate malicious activity."

The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score should also be 0, except for a minor overestimation in one report which is unjustified. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the testing context but no actual threat."

The previously assigned small security risk score of 0.2 in report 5 is an overestimate; the actual risk is negligible. All other reports correctly identify the code as benign."

The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be 0 for all reports. The high risk scores in some reports are unjustified given the benign nature of the code."
