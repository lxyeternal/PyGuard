  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for Gaussian OT functions with no malicious or suspicious content. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score should also be 0, except for a minor overestimation in one report which is unjustified. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
