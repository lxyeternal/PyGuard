{
  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the Python Optimal Transport (POT) library, including compilation of Cython/C++ extensions and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, version extraction from __init__.py, open/read of README.md, subprocess call to 'xcrun', check_openmp_support function, file removal, environment variable setting, and extension source files.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to 'xcrun' (platform-specific SDK path), environment variable 'CFLAGS', and file deletion. No untrusted input handling or data leak points are evident.",
  "flows": "Reading version and README -> setting compile flags -> setting environment variables -> compiling extension modules; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'check_openmp_support' suggests dynamic detection of system capabilities; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed. The file deletion of 'emd_wrap.cpp' is routine cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup process with environment configuration, package compilation, and dependency resolution. It uses subprocess to get SDK paths on macOS, which is a legitimate system query. The extension sources are local files, with no external code execution or untrusted data handling. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code structure and comments are consistent with standard setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for building a Python package with Cython/C++ extensions, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It employs legitimate system queries and file operations, with no hidden or suspicious code. Overall, it appears safe.",
