{
  "purpose": "Build and install the 'POT' package, including Cython/C++ extensions, with platform-specific configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'ot/__init__.py', reads README.md, executes subprocess calls to 'xcrun' for SDK path detection, and reads environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to 'xcrun' to obtain SDK path, environment variable modifications ('CFLAGS'), and file reads for version and README.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README, runs subprocess to get SDK path, sets environment variables, and proceeds with package setup and compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Subprocess calls are standard for build scripts. No network activity or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical build setup tasks for a Python package with platform-specific adjustments. Subprocess calls to 'xcrun' are common in macOS environments. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The code reads files and sets environment variables in a standard manner, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for building a Python package with Cython/C++ extensions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The subprocess calls and environment modifications are typical in such contexts and do not indicate malicious activity.",
