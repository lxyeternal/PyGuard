  "purpose": "The code provides a suite of unit tests for Gaussian mixture models and optimal transport functions, validating mathematical correctness and behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_gmms function generating test data, and test functions invoking core library functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exception handling within test functions; no external data, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Generated random data and predefined parameters flow through validation functions, with results checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of tests for mathematical functions related to Gaussian mixtures and optimal transport. It uses controlled random data, assertions, and exception checks to validate correctness. No external system interactions, network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious data flows. The use of optional torch imports and skip decorators for backend compatibility are standard practices, not indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for statistical and mathematical functions, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.05), reflecting the safe nature of the testing environment.",
