  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely documentation and static imports, with no dynamic data handling, user input, or network operations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 (minimal, since it's mostly documentation and static imports, but a slight concern if someone considers the large comment as a potential vector—though unlikely)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it contains only setup code and documentation, with no runtime data processing or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 (again, primarily boilerplate and documentation, but the same reasoning applies)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—documentation and static imports, no executable or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous, no dynamic code, no user input, no network activity, just setup and documentation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, static imports, documentation, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports show no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Malware score should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward. Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since all code is static, contains no executable logic, and is purely documentation plus safe imports, the risk score should be **0** or very close to it. Given the current scores are 0.5, I recommend lowering them to **0** for accuracy.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis code is standard SDK boilerplate and documentation, with no malicious or security-threatening content.",
