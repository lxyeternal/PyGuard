  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of findings from each report:**\n\n- **Report 1:**  \n  - **Issue presence:** No issues detected.  \n  - **Errors/flaws:** None; the code is purely documentation and static imports.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK setup.  \n\n- **Report 2:**  \n  - **Issue presence:** No issues detected.  \n  - **Errors/flaws:** None; the code is straightforward module setup.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Safe, typical SDK code.  \n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  - **Issue presence:** No issues detected.  \n  - **Errors/flaws:** None; mainly documentation and static imports.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Safe, boilerplate SDK code.  \n\n- **Report 4:**  \n  - **Issue presence:** No issues detected.  \n  - **Errors/flaws:** None; documentation and imports only.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Safe, standard API client setup.  \n\n- **Report 5:**  \n  - **Issue presence:** No issues detected.  \n  - **Errors/flaws:** None; documentation and static imports only.  \n  - **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Safe, typical SDK module.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports describe code that is primarily documentation, static imports, and versioning info for an SDK or API client.  \n- **Malicious activity:** None detected in any report. No code execution, no network activity, no embedded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None present.  \n- **Security risk:** None identified; the code is standard SDK boilerplate and documentation.\n\n### Final scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **My reasoned estimate:**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the code is benign, standard SDK setup with extensive documentation, and no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Therefore, I recommend the following scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
