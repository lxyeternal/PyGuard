{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module for interacting with LaunchDarkly's REST API, providing API client, configuration, and exception handling classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static information from the module docstring, imports classes from external modules ('launchdarkly_api.api_client', 'launchdarkly_api.configuration', 'launchdarkly_api.exceptions'), and defines a version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no user input handling, no network calls, no environment variable use, and no database operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes imports and a version string; there are no data flows, input processing, or output actions involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The extensive docstring is a detailed API documentation template, not executable logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscation or malicious code segments are evident.",
  "analysis": "The module imports specific classes and exceptions related to API client operation, with a descriptive docstring outlining API details and best practices. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code's purpose is clearly to provide an API interface, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-documented API client module with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use within a larger project. The only notable aspect is the comprehensive API documentation in the comment, which is typical for SDK modules.",
