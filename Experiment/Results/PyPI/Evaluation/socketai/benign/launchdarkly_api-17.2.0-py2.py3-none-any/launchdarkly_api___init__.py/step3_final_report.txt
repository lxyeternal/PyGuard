{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a boilerplate SDK setup and documentation module for interacting with LaunchDarkly's REST API, primarily importing modules and defining versioning information.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'launchdarkly_api' modules, version and exception definitions, and extensive documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, user input, or network operations are present within the code.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code consists solely of static imports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, comprising import statements, versioning info, and comprehensive documentation comments. It does not process input, perform network operations, or execute logic that could be malicious. The imported modules are from a reputable SDK package, and the comments are purely informational. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, aligning with the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK or documentation setup with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
