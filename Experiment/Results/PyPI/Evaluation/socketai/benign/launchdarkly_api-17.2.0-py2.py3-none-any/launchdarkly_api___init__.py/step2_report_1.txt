  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as primarily consisting of extensive documentation, import statements, and setup for interacting with the LaunchDarkly API.\n- No dynamic data flows, user input processing, or network operations are present within the code snippets.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated SDK boilerplate or documentation modules, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The malware score across all reports is consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, confirming the code is straightforward and transparent.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the conclusion that this code is safe.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly 0, reflecting no security risks identified.\n\n**Potential Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable. The documentation-heavy nature of the code and the static imports from a known SDK package justify the low scores.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on the static code and comments provided.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard SDK or API client setup with comprehensive documentation.\n- No executable or runtime code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The extensive comments are purely informational, not executable.\n- The imported modules are from a reputable, presumably open-source SDK package.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a safe, standard SDK or documentation module for LaunchDarkly's API interaction. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                     |\n| Risk           | 0                     |\n\nNo further action needed. The code is benign and well within safe parameters.",
