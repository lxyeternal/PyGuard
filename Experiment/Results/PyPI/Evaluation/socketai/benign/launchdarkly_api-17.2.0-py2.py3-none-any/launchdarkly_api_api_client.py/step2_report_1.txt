  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logical consistency, potential security issues, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard, auto-generated API client with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.5\n\n**Assessment**:  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a typical API client, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The detailed reasoning confirms the absence of suspicious patterns. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard API client with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's nature. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, which is justified given the description.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The security risk is low, considering the code's purpose and structure.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a typical API client with standard request handling.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:  \nThe analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious patterns and the standard nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, a standard API client with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:  \nThe reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code is a typical, auto-generated API client with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk Score**: Mostly 0.1 or 0.5. Given the nature of the code—an API client library—these are reasonable. The minimal risk scores reflect the low likelihood of security issues.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation\n\n**Malware**: 0 — No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.  \n**Obfuscated**: 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation patterns.  \n**Security Risk**: 0.1 — Slightly above zero, accounting for potential misconfiguration or misuse, but overall very low.\n\n**Justification**:  \nThe code is auto-generated, handles request and response securely, and does not contain any suspicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, considering the potential for misconfiguration or accidental exposure, but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports are consistent with a benign, standard API client implementation. The assigned scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
