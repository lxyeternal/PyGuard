  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided details, and determine the appropriate scores based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client wrapper with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The report finds no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a typical API client with standard libraries, proper error handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The low security risk score aligns with the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard HTTP client with proper SSL, proxy, and request handling, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected. The code handles network requests, SSL, and proxy logic responsibly.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified. The code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical HTTP client with no suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (still low)\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, and standard network utility functions.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, standard API client, no malicious or sabotage behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, and the code uses trusted libraries.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with prior reports, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and standard request handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and the detailed analysis confirms no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, supported by the lack of obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, standard API client for LaunchDarkly, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- The functions and request handling follow best practices, and no malicious payloads or backdoors are evident.\n- The network utility functions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, typical for network client code)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any malicious or suspicious patterns in the code.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, benign API client with no malicious or sabotage indicators.",
