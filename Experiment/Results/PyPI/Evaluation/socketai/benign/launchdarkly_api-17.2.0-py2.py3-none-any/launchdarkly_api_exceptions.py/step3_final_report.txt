  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for API error handling, including context-aware messages and HTTP response details.",
  "sources": "Error data from API responses, HTTP headers, and response bodies used for constructing error messages.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting and exception raising; potential if malicious data is passed as error details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses into exception constructors, used solely for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or malicious code; standard pattern for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs exception classes that encapsulate API error information, formatting messages with optional path and response data. It does not execute or interpret untrusted code, nor does it contain obfuscation or backdoors. The only potential concern is that error details from external sources could be crafted maliciously, but since the code only formats and raises exceptions without executing or parsing the data beyond string formatting, the security risk remains minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured error handling framework for an API client SDK. It poses no malware threat or malicious activity. The minimal risk associated with processing error data is inherent to error reporting mechanisms and does not constitute a security concern.",
