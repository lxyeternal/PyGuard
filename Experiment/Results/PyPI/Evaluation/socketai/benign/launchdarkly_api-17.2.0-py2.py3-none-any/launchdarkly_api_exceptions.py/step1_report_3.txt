  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling errors in the OpenAPI client library, including error formatting and specific HTTP response errors.",
  "sources": "Constants, class definitions, and functions that handle exceptions, error message formatting, and response parsing.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction and raising exceptions; no untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input error data flows into exception constructors, which format and raise exceptions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code is standard for API client error handling; no unusual or suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes for handling different API errors and formatting error messages. It includes classes for type, value, attribute, key, and general API exceptions, with specific subclasses for common HTTP errors such as 404, 401, 403. The functions and classes serve as error handling mechanisms and do not process or handle untrusted data inputs or outputs. No code injection, malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be part of an auto-generated SDK or client library, following common patterns for error management. Overall, the code is straightforward, safe, and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of error handling classes for an API client, with no indications of malicious activity or sabotage. It merely provides structured exception classes for use elsewhere in the SDK. The code is benign and safe for deployment.",
