  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine the presence of issues, logical flaws, or security risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes; no external data reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processed or transmitted; error messages constructed from static/dynamic data but no external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard exception classes; no obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, implementing custom exceptions for error handling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on error formatting and class structure.\n- No external data or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Defines exception classes with error formatting.\n- No external data processing or network operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, exception classes and utility functions.\n- No data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly different: notes that the code reads from API responses, including HTTP response data and error messages.\n- Potential sinks involve error message formatting, which could be exploited if malicious data is passed.\n- **Analysis:** The code primarily formats error messages and encapsulates error data. It does process data from API responses but only for error reporting, which is typical and expected.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The data handling is limited to error message construction, which is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly indicate no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports are straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given that these are error handling classes, and no malicious or insecure behavior is detected, a low risk score (e.g., 0) is justified.\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n- The code is standard, safe, and well-structured for its purpose.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- The only slight consideration is report 5 mentioning data from API responses, but since it is only used for error reporting and does not process untrusted data in a malicious way, risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely infrastructural, standard error handling classes with no security concerns.",
