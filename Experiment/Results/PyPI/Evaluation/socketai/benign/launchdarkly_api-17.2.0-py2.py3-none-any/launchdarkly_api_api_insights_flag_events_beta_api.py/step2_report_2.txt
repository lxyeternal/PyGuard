  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a generated API client for LaunchDarkly's Insights Flag Events Beta API, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** No external or untrusted sources read directly; no dangerous sinks; standard data flow from parameters to API request.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is a typical API client with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (or lower). The report assigns 1 for confidence, which is reasonable given the thoroughness.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a standard API client, notes unused imports ('re', 'sys')—benign but slightly inefficient.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets; standard request construction.\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe; the only minor concern is unused imports, which do not impact security.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The report assigns 0.9 confidence and a low security risk, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above; describes a legitimate API client for the beta endpoint.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward API request code, typical of generated SDKs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's confidence is high, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard API client code.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard request handling.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The report assigns a slightly higher security risk, possibly due to the potential for sensitive data exposure if misused, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores; the malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous; API client for the beta endpoint.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Assessment:** Typical generated SDK code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero; the code is straightforward, generated SDK code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting the safe nature of the code—it's a standard API client.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to minimal concerns like unused imports, but overall very safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate given the code's nature. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated API client for LaunchDarkly's Insights Flag Events API. It is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scoring in the reports accurately reflects this assessment.",
