  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured deserialization framework with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. Its complexity introduces some risk if validation is bypassed, but no active malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.3 are justified."
