It manages sensitive data securely and performs routine configuration tasks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting typical configuration-related concerns rather than security threats."

Its complexity introduces some risk if validation is bypassed, but no active malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.3 are justified."

It is a standard API client library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern beyond typical operational considerations."

The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk associated with request construction in SDK code, which does not process or execute untrusted data internally. All evidence indicates a benign, well-structured SDK component."
