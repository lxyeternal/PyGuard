  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, obfuscation, malware, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes an auto-generated API client class for managing workflow templates. Input parameters are from method calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Requests are constructed and sent via `call_with_http_info`. No code executes untrusted data or dynamic code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard for an SDK, with external dependencies being normal.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard, with high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, describing a client class for API interaction with no untrusted data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request construction, with no code execution or data evaluation beyond validation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code. It’s a typical SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's structure. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a client interface for API endpoints, with input from method parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request payloads; no processing of untrusted data beyond request assembly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard SDK code, high confidence (1). Malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, describing an API client for workflow templates.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from parameters are used to build API requests; no internal data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, typical SDK pattern, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct reasoning; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a client wrapper for API endpoints, with input from method parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into request construction, with no internal processing of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard SDK code, very high confidence (0.95). Malware and obfuscated scores are zero.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Type:** All reports describe auto-generated API client wrappers, which are inherently standard and do not contain malicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, primarily because the code is request-assembly for API calls, with no dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Scores Justification:** The high confidence and zero malware/obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward, generated, and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of SDK code, overall risk remains very low, around 0.1, mainly because of potential misuse of input parameters if malicious data is supplied externally, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a typical, safe API client wrapper with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
