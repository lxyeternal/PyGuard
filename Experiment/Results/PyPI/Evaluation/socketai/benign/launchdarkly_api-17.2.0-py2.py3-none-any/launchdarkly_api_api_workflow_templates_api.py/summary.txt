  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API client wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk associated with request construction in SDK code, which does not process or execute untrusted data internally. All evidence indicates a benign, well-structured SDK component."
