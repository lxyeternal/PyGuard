  "purpose": "Auto-generated API client wrapper for managing workflow templates in LaunchDarkly, facilitating creation, deletion, and retrieval of templates via structured method calls.",
  "sources": "Method parameters supplied by the user, such as create_workflow_template_input, template_key, and search queries, which are used to construct API request payloads and URLs.",
  "sinks": "API request construction and execution through call_with_http_info; no untrusted data is executed or evaluated; request data is sent over HTTPS to specified endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request payloads or URL path segments, which are then transmitted via HTTP methods (POST, DELETE, GET) to the server; no internal data processing or dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected; code follows standard SDK patterns for API interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, auto-generated SDK client class for interacting with LaunchDarkly's workflow template API endpoints. It constructs requests based on method inputs, with no dynamic code execution, eval, or untrusted data evaluation. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The request handling is straightforward, and dependencies are standard. The high confidence scores (close to 1) and zero malware/obfuscation scores are justified given the code's nature as a request wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API client wrapper with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal inherent risk associated with request construction in SDK code, which does not process or execute untrusted data internally. All evidence indicates a benign, well-structured SDK component.",
