{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'flakeheaven' package using importlib.metadata or a fallback for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata; usage of metadata.version to get package version.",
  "sinks": "The code only accesses package metadata; no sinks for untrusted input or data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "Importing metadata module -> calling metadata.version('flakeheaven') -> assigning version to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to maintain compatibility across Python versions by importing 'metadata' from the standard library or a third-party fallback. It retrieves the version of a specific package, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for package version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation for obtaining package version information. There are no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
