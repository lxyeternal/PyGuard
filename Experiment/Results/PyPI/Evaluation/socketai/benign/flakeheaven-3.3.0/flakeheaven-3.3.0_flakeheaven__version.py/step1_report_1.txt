{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'flakeheaven' package using importlib.metadata or its backport.",
  "sources": "Import statements from importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata package, and the call to metadata.version('flakeheaven')",
  "sinks": "The call to metadata.version('flakeheaven') could potentially be used to retrieve package version info, but this is generally harmless and standard.",
  "flows": "Import statements set up the environment, and metadata.version fetches package info; no untrusted data source or sink involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard pattern for version retrieval across Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'metadata' depending on Python version, then retrieves the version of the 'flakeheaven' package. It is a typical pattern for backward compatibility and does not involve any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, external network activity, or data leaks are present. The purpose is solely to obtain package version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for retrieving package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
