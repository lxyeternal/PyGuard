  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'flakeheaven' package in a backward-compatible manner.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata' and the call to 'metadata.version('flakeheaven')'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only reads package metadata locally.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from 'importlib' or fallback to 'importlib_metadata', then calling 'metadata.version' with a static package name.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a common pattern for backward compatibility, importing 'metadata' from 'importlib' if available, otherwise from 'importlib_metadata'. It then retrieves the version string for 'flakeheaven'. The logic is simple, with no external input, network activity, or data leaks. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is a benign utility for package metadata access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for obtaining package version information across Python versions. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are accurate and appropriate.",
