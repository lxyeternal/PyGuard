  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report in relation to the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code attempts to import `metadata` from `importlib.metadata` (Python 3.8+), and if that fails (i.e., on earlier Python versions), it imports `importlib_metadata` (a backport). Then it retrieves the version of the 'flakeheaven' package via `metadata.version('flakeheaven')`. This is a common, standard pattern for version retrieval with backward compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes standard version retrieval.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is benign, standard, and secure.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as harmless. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, a standard approach with no malicious intent.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — Slightly higher, but still very low, considering the code's benign nature.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly elevated security risk score seems to be a conservative estimate, but given the code's straightforward nature, it remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard, compatible version retrieval.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (slightly lower, but still high)\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score is 0.1, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is a well-known pattern for backward-compatible package version retrieval. No anomalies, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0 malware and 0 obfuscated, consistent with the code.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1) are acceptable given the conservative nature of scoring, but overall, the code does not pose any security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — minimal to none, as the code performs a benign, standard operation.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed. The code is a standard, safe implementation for version retrieval across Python versions.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, non-malicious, and follows best practices for compatibility. The scoring reflects this appropriately.",
