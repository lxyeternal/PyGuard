{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line interface dispatcher for a Python tool, handling command parsing, help display, and command execution.",
  "sources": "argv parameter, sys.argv, external modules (_constants, _logic, _types, commands)",
  "sinks": "print statements, sys.exit calls, command function invocations",
  "flows": "argv input → command lookup in COMMANDS → command execution or help display → output via print or exit",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; external modules assumed safe",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI dispatcher with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. It relies on predefined command mappings and standard Python practices. External modules are assumed to be safe; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The command handling logic is typical and does not process untrusted data beyond command names, which are validated against COMMANDS. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI dispatcher with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with a standard command-line tool.",
