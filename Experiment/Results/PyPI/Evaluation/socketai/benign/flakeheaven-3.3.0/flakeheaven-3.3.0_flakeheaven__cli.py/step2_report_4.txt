  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard CLI dispatcher for a Python application, handling command parsing, help display, and process termination.\n- None of the reports identify suspicious code, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating that the reviewers are quite certain about the benign nature.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears to be a typical command-line interface handler with no evident malicious behavior.\n- The command dispatch relies on an external `COMMANDS` dictionary, which is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The use of `sys.exit()` and `print()` is standard and safe in this context.\n- No suspicious data processing or external calls are evident.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is that the code relies on external modules (`_constants`, `_logic`, `_types`, `commands`) whose contents are unknown. If these modules contain malicious code, that could be a concern, but based on the reports, they are assumed safe.\n- The code itself is straightforward and does not contain any logic that could be exploited or malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The command parsing and help display logic are standard.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The overall low scores are justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- No signs of malicious intent, malicious payloads, or supply chain issues are detected.\n- The only potential concern could be in the external modules, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly even 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the minimal residual risk from external modules or future modifications)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is a standard CLI dispatcher with no suspicious logic, I would set the overall scores as follows:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0, if we assume external modules are safe)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code appears safe, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should remain at 0. The overall assessment aligns with the detailed reviews provided.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at **0**  \n- Keep obfuscated score at **0**  \n- Set overall security risk score at **0.1** (or 0 if external modules are verified safe)",
