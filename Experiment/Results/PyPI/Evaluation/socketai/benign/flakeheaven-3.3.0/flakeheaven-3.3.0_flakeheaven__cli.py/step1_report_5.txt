{
  "purpose": "This code implements a command-line interface (CLI) entry point, command dispatcher, and help display functions for a Python application.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments (`argv`) and imported modules",
  "sinks": "Output to the console via `print()` and process exit via `sys.exit()`",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> main() determines command -> command execution or help display -> output and sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules and application-specific modules, then defines functions to display commands, process commands based on `argv`, and exit appropriately. The code is straightforward, with no indications of malicious payloads. The command dispatching is handled via a dictionary (`COMMANDS`) which is external and presumed safe, as it’s a typical pattern for CLI tools. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or external network activity. The exit codes and printed messages are consistent with expected CLI behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard CLI dispatcher with no evident malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is well-structured and uses common patterns for command handling.",
