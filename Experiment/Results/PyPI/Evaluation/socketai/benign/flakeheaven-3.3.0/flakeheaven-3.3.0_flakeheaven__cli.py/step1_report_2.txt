{
  "purpose": "The code implements a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a tool named 'flakeheaven', providing command execution, help display, and integration with flake8.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (input arguments), imported modules (_constants, _logic, _types, commands)",
  "sinks": "print statements (output), sys.exit (terminating process)",
  "flows": "argv input → main() → command lookup → command execution or help display → output via print → sys.exit",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code appears straightforward with no obfuscated logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles command parsing and dispatching. It uses standard library features and clean command lookup logic. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data leaks are present. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks; it functions as a typical CLI handler.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs command validation, help display, and process termination in a typical manner without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
