{
  "purpose": "This code implements command-line interface logic for a tool, handling command display, input parsing, and program entry points.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'argv' parameter (from sys.argv or passed explicitly), and command names are obtained from the first element of argv.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs messages via print statements, and calls sys.exit() with an exit code. No direct data leaks or untrusted data execution is evident.",
  "flows": "Input argv -> main() determines command -> may invoke specific command functions -> output messages -> sys.exit() with status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external network activity, and no obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward CLI handling logic: it displays commands, handles help and invalid commands, and calls command functions with arguments. It uses safe string formatting, does not execute untrusted data, and relies on external command implementations. There are no suspicious patterns or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI interface for a larger application. It handles command parsing and output but does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified based on this code alone.",
