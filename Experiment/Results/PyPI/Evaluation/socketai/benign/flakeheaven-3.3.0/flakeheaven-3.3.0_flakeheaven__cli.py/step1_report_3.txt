{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line interface for a tool (possibly a linter or utility) that provides command execution, help display, and entry point handling.",
  "sources": "Input data from sys.argv and function parameters (argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to the console via print(). Calls sys.exit() with exit codes.",
  "flows": "User input (argv) flows into main() which processes command names, then to COMMANDS handlers or help display, and results are printed or used to exit the program.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of standard library functions and well-defined control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv or function parameters, processes commands based on a COMMANDS dictionary, displays help information, and exits with appropriate codes. No data from untrusted sources other than command-line input, which is handled through predefined command dispatching. The code uses standard methods for CLI management and does not include dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads, nor any suspicious obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI handler with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It processes input commands and provides help, with proper exit handling. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malicious payloads are present.",
