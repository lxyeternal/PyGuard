{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a command-line interface (CLI) entry point and command dispatcher for a tool, managing commands and providing help and validation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via function parameters or sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.exit to terminate the program, and print to output messages; no untrusted data directly processed or outputted to external systems",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs are processed to determine commands; messages are printed to stdout or stderr; program exits with appropriate status codes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The import of local modules (_constants, _logic, etc.) is typical for modular Python CLI applications. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic found.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for showing commands, handling command dispatch, and entrypoints for CLI execution. It uses standard practices such as command lookup, help display, and proper exit codes. The import statements suggest reliance on other modules, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The use of sys.exit and print are typical for CLI apps. No data leaks, unsafe operations, or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or environment variable usages that are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard CLI dispatcher for a Python tool, with no signs of malicious or maliciously sabotaged behavior. It follows typical patterns for command processing and program exit handling. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
