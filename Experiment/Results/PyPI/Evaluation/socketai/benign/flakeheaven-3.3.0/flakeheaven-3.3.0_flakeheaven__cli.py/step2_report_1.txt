  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scores assigned, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- It is a CLI entry point and command dispatcher for a Python tool.\n- It displays commands, handles help requests, validates commands, and executes command functions.\n- Uses standard practices: `sys.argv`, `print`, `sys.exit`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n- Relies on external modules (`_constants`, `_logic`, `_types`, `commands`) which are assumed to be safe.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: CLI dispatcher, no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (low, possibly because it handles command dispatching)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malware or obfuscation detected. The low security risk is justified, but no actual security threat exists.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: CLI for 'flakeheaven', standard command parsing.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: CLI for a tool, similar to above.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (still very low)\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: CLI handling, straightforward.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard CLI dispatcher.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** They are very low, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.** The code is a standard CLI handler with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, mostly due to command dispatching, which is typical and safe)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign CLI dispatcher with no security risks or malware. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
