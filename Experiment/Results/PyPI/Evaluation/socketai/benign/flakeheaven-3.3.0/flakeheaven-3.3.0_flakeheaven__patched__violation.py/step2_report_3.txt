  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines a namedtuple `_Violation` that extends `flake8.style_guide.Violation` by adding a `plugin` field.\n- It then creates a subclass `FlakeHeavenViolation` that inherits from `_Violation` and provides methods `is_inline_ignored` and `is_in`, which delegate to the original `Violation` class.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and does not process untrusted data or perform any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** process external input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- The methods delegate to existing `Violation` methods without adding logic that could be malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The extension is purely for static analysis tooling, adding extra metadata.\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The use of a namedtuple subclassing pattern is appropriate for extending immutable data structures.\n- Delegation methods are simple and safe.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risk; the code is benign extension code.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature.\n- The scores are consistent across reports; no adjustments needed.\n- The delegation methods (`is_inline_ignored`, `is_in`) are safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious intent or activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a benign, standard extension of static analysis data structures, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves a purpose in extending linting violation data structures without introducing any security concerns.",
