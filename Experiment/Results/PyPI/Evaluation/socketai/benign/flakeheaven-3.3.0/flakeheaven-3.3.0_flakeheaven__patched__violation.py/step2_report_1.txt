  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its purpose, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a namedtuple `_Violation` extending the `Violation` class from `flake8.style_guide`, adding an extra `plugin` field.\n- Creates a subclass `FlakeHeavenViolation` that inherits from `_Violation` and delegates some methods to the original `Violation`.\n- The code is static, mainly for extending data structures used in static analysis tooling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute code dynamically.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The extension appears straightforward and benign.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The code correctly extends the namedtuple by creating a subclass that wraps the existing `Violation` methods, which is a common pattern given namedtuples' immutability.\n- No evident logical errors or security flaws.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, correct as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0, aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely structural and does not process external data or perform actions that could be exploited, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for obfuscated, malware, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- The detailed analysis correctly reflects the code's benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the provided scores.**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a harmless extension of static analysis data structures with no security implications.**\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary to the scores. The analysis is accurate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
