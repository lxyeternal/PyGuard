{
  "purpose": "Define a custom violation class for flake8 with additional fields for enhanced linting information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class and function definitions, and imports external modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is primarily class and data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code includes straightforward class inheritance and method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple '_Violation' to extend flake8's Violation class with an additional 'plugin' field. It then subclasses this namedtuple into 'FlakeHeavenViolation' to add methods for inline ignore checks and diff inclusion, delegating these to the original Violation class. All components are static, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors. The implementation appears standard and intended to enhance linting metadata handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of flake8 violation data structures, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
