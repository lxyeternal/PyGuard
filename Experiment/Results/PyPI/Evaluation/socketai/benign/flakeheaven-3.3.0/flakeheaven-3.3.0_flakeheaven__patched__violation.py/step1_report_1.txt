{
  "purpose": "Define custom violation data structures for use with flake8 style guide, extending existing classes with additional fields and methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements from built-in and external libraries; class and function definitions manipulating violation data structures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data leaks could occur.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported Violation objects through methods like is_inline_ignored and is_in, but these are standard library calls without manipulation of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures using namedtuples and extends them via a subclass. It adds fields to store violation details and wraps existing methods for inline ignoring and inclusion checks. The implementation is straightforward, utilizing standard library features, and does not process external input or perform any operations that could be malicious. There are no suspicious patterns or behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension of existing violation data structures for a linter tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
