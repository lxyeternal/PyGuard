{
  "purpose": "Define a namedtuple '_Violation' extending 'Violation' with an additional 'plugin' field, and create a subclass 'FlakeHeavenViolation' that delegates certain methods to the original 'Violation'.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of '_Violation' namedtuple, usage of 'Violation.is_inline_ignored' and 'Violation.is_in' methods within 'FlakeHeavenViolation'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "Method calls in 'is_inline_ignored' and 'is_in' delegate to 'Violation' methods; no external data flow or untrusted source to sink path exists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. The code is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static data structure extension for static analysis tooling, adding a 'plugin' field to violation records. The subclass 'FlakeHeavenViolation' delegates method calls to the original 'Violation' class, ensuring compatibility. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves a benign purpose. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of static analysis data structures with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's harmless nature.",
