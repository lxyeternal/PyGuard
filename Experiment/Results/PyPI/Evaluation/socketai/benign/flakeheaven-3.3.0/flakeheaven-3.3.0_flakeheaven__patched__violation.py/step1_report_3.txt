{
  "purpose": "Define custom violation data structures for flake8 plugin development, extending existing Violation class with additional fields.",
  "sources": "Code imports from standard library ('collections') and external ('flake8.style_guide'), and defines classes and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data sources or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported Violation to custom classes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a namedtuple '_Violation' extending 'Violation' with additional fields, and a class 'FlakeHeavenViolation' that inherits from '_Violation' to add methods. The code is straightforward, intended for extending flake8 violations. No external input handling, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of flake8 violation structures for plugin development, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
