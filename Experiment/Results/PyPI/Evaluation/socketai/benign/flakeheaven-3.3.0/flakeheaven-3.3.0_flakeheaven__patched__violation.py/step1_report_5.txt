{
  "purpose": "Define a custom violation class for flake8 with additional fields for enhanced linting information.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the collections module and the flake8.style_guide module, and defines a namedtuple and a class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output points or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into the namedtuple and class definitions without external or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The code simply extends existing classes and adds methods.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a namedtuple '_Violation' with specific fields, including an extra 'plugin' field, then defines 'FlakeHeavenViolation' class inheriting from it. The class provides methods that call corresponding methods on the base 'Violation' class. There is no evidence of malicious logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a straightforward extension for managing flake8 violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension to flake8's violation handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It purely adds fields and simple method wrappers, with no external input, data leaks, or harmful actions.",
