{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom classes and data structures to extend and modify the behavior of flake8 style guide violations, mainly for static code analysis and linting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'collections' module and the 'flake8.style_guide' module, importing specific classes and creating new subclasses.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or system impact.",
  "flows": "The code initializes data structures with imported data and adds methods to subclasses, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be straightforward class and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a namedtuple '_Violation' with added fields, then creates a subclass 'FlakeHeavenViolation' to extend functionality. The methods 'is_inline_ignored' and 'is_in' delegate to the original 'Violation' class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code segments. The structure is typical for extending static analysis tooling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension of static analysis data structures for linting purposes. It does not contain malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
