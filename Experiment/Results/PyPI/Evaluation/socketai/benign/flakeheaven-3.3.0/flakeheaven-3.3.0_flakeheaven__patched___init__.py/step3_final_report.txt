  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, typical of a package __init__.py. No data processing, external communication, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, straightforward nature of this code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
