{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports a class or function named 'FlakeHeavenApplication' from a relative module '_app' and exports it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module './_app'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and exports the symbol.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and export statement with no data processing, no dynamic execution, and no external inputs. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious constructs. The import from a relative module suggests this is part of a larger project, but on its own, it shows no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a module interface to expose 'FlakeHeavenApplication'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
