  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file for a Python package, exposing the FlakeHeavenApplication class from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing _app.FlakeHeavenApplication",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and export statement; no unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class from a local module and defines __all__ for package exports. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. The module _app is expected to be a local module, and no malicious code is visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a typical module export setup.",
