  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual patterns; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class from a local module and re-exports it. No data processing, user input, or external communication occurs. The structure is straightforward, typical of Python package __init__.py files. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple package initializer to expose a class. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
