  "purpose": "The code defines a custom file processor class for handling Python files, utilizing parsers based on file extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading filename from self.filename, retrieving parser based on file suffix, and reading file contents.",
  "sinks": "Calling parser.parse with a Path object, which may process file data.",
  "flows": "self.filename -> Path(self.filename) -> PARSERS.get() -> parser.parse(path=path)",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic assignment of parser based on file extension; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a third-party FileProcessor class. It defines a subclass with a method that converts a filename into a Path object, dynamically selects a parser from a parser dictionary based on file extension, and then uses this parser to parse the file. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The parser is chosen dynamically, which is typical and not suspicious. No data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are observed. The code is straightforward, and the flow is limited to reading and parsing files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate file processing implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It dynamically selects parsers based on file extension and processes files accordingly, which is typical in code analysis tools.",
