{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom file processor class for the flake8 linting tool, which dynamically selects a parser based on the file extension.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filename property of the FileProcessor object and the file path from self.filename.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious effects; the code primarily reads file paths and uses parser mappings.",
  "flows": "Input: self.filename → Determines file path → Selects parser from PARSERS based on suffix → Parses file content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; dynamic parser selection based on file suffix is standard but could be misused if PARSERS is malicious or improperly configured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a subclass of FileProcessor, and overrides read_lines_from_filename to select a parser dynamically based on file suffix. The parser is set to PythonParser by default but is replaced with a parser from PARSERS mapping if available. No external data input beyond the filename occurs, and no untrusted data processing is evident. The code appears straightforward and functional, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a dynamic file parser for a linting tool, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and standard in practice.",
