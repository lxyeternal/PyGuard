  "purpose": "Dynamically select a parser based on file extension and parse the file.",
  "sources": "self.filename used to determine file path and extension.",
  "sinks": "self.parser.parse() method called with a Path object.",
  "flows": "self.filename -> Path(self.filename) -> self.parser (from PARSERS) -> parse(path) method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard dynamic parser selection. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from FileProcessor, with a method that converts the filename to a Path, dynamically assigns a parser based on file extension from a PARSERS dictionary, and calls parse() on that parser with the Path. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident. The main external risk depends on the trustworthiness of the parsers in PARSERS. The code itself is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external parser implementations. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's simplicity and external dependency reliance.",
