  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external parser implementations. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's simplicity and external dependency reliance."
