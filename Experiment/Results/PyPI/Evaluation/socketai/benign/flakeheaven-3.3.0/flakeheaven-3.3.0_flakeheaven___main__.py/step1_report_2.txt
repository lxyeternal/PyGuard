{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes an entrypoint function from a local module, likely to start a command-line interface or application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('._cli') and invocation of 'entrypoint()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'entrypoint()', which could potentially run arbitrary code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of 'entrypoint' -> call to 'entrypoint()' function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named 'entrypoint' from a local module '_cli' and immediately calls it. Without the implementation of 'entrypoint', it's impossible to determine if it contains malicious behavior. The code itself is standard for a command-line tool bootstrap and does not exhibit signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious operations within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple entry point to execute functionality defined elsewhere. Based on the provided snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, the security of the overall system depends on the implementation of 'entrypoint()' in the '_cli' module.",
