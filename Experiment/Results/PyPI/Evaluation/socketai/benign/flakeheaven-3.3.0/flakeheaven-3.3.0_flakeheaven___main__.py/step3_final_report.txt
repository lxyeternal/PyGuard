  "anomalies": "None in the code snippet itself; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing and executing a function from a local module. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of '_cli.entrypoint()'. The code itself is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with this analysis. The main concern is the trustworthiness of '_cli', which cannot be assessed here. If '_cli.entrypoint()' contains malicious code, the risk would be higher, but without evidence, the current low scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal CLI entry point with no inherent malicious behavior. The security risk hinges on the implementation of '_cli.entrypoint()'. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and reflect a very low security risk, assuming '_cli.entrypoint()' is benign.",
