{
  "purpose": "This code imports an 'entrypoint' function from a local module '_cli' and executes it. It appears to serve as the main entry point for a command-line application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._cli module; execution of entrypoint() function",
  "sinks": "Execution of entrypoint() could be a sink if it involves untrusted input or executes malicious code",
  "flows": "Import from _cli -> call to entrypoint()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward, just invoking a function from a relative module",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named 'entrypoint' from a local module '_cli' and immediately calls it. Since '_cli' is a local module, its code is critical to understanding the behavior. Without the source code of '_cli', we cannot definitively assess if 'entrypoint()' performs malicious actions. However, the structure suggests typical CLI application startup code. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code in this snippet. The potential risk depends on what 'entrypoint()' executes within the '_cli' module, which is not provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evident malicious behavior. The code simply imports and runs an entry point from a local module. Without additional context about '_cli', the risk remains low. No indicators of malware or security issues are apparent here.",
