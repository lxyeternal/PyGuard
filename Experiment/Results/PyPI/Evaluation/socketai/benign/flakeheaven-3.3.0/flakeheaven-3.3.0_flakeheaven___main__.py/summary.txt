  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal CLI entry point with no inherent malicious behavior. The security risk hinges on the implementation of '_cli.entrypoint()'. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and reflect a very low security risk, assuming '_cli.entrypoint()' is benign."
