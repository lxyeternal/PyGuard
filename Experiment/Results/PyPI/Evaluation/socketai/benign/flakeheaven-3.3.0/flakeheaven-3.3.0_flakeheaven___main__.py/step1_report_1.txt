  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple entry point for a Python application, importing an entrypoint function from a local module '_cli' and executing it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._cli and execution of entrypoint()",
  "sinks": "Execution of entrypoint() function; potential for the function to perform unsafe or malicious actions if compromised",
  "flows": "Import _cli module -> call entrypoint() -> executes whatever code is defined in entrypoint()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed in the provided snippet; the code is minimal and standard for CLI apps",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'entrypoint' from a local module '_cli' and immediately calls it. This is typical for a command-line interface application. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The actual behavior depends entirely on the implementation of '_cli.entrypoint()'. Since no such implementation is provided, the code itself appears benign. However, because the execution depends on an external module, potential malicious activity could be hidden within '_cli'. Without examining '_cli', the risk cannot be fully assessed, but the snippet itself is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple entry point for an application, with no apparent malicious behavior in this snippet. The overall security depends on the implementation of '_cli.entrypoint()'. Based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
