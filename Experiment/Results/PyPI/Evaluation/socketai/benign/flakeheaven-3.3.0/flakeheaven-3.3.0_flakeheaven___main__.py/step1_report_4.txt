  "sinks": "The call to entrypoint() executes code from the imported module",
  "flows": "Import ._cli -> call entrypoint() -> execute code in that function",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; reliance on external module for core functionality, but no suspicious code here",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named entrypoint from a local module ._cli and then executes it. There are no other operations, data manipulations, or inputs in this snippet. The behavior is typical for CLI applications to delegate control to a main function. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The security depends on the content of the _cli module, which is not provided. Based solely on this code, it performs a simple, expected task.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal entry point that calls a function from a local module. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. Security considerations depend on the implementation of _cli, but this code itself is benign.",
