  "purpose": "A wrapper for Flake8 to enhance configurability and usability",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules ._cli and ._version, accessing __version__",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks, only static imports and export of symbols",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior present",
