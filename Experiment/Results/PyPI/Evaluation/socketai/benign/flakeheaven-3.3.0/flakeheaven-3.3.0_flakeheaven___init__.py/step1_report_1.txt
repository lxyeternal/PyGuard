{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a wrapper for the Flake8 tool, designed to provide a nicer and configurable interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: ._cli and ._version",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports and defines __all__, with no data flows or processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements with no dynamic code or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal wrapper module that imports specific functions and version info from local submodules. It sets __all__ to expose these symbols. There are no functions, user input handling, or dynamic operations present. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign wrapper module for a Flake8 utility. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code are present. It appears safe.",
