  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a minimal Python module that imports functions and version info from internal modules (_cli and _version).\n- It defines `__all__` to specify what symbols are exported.\n- There are no functions, no user input handling, no external data processing, no network calls, and no dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper or entry point setup for a Flake8 plugin or utility.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, and the logic is straightforward. No issues are apparent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities or security flaws are evident.\n- **Potential malware or obfuscation:** None detected.\n\n### Review of each report:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for a Python package's initialization or wrapper module.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Scoring considerations:\n- The scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are 1, which is justified given the clear, benign nature of the code.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a benign wrapper module.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are warranted here.\n- The code's purpose is purely organizational and interface-defining, with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the existing scores and conclusions. The code is safe, benign, and straightforward. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nLet's proceed with this assessment.",
