  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper interface for Flake8, a Python linting tool, making it more configurable and accessible via command-line entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_cli and _version) and the assignment of __all__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output based on external input.",
  "flows": "The code only imports functions and assigns a list to __all__, with no data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py or main module file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that re-exports functions and variables from internal modules, likely to expose a clean API. No external data inputs, no execution logic, no dynamic code, no credential handling, and no suspicious behaviors. It is a typical package setup file meant for defining exports and versioning.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior or security risk present in this code. It is a standard wrapper module exposing certain functions and variables. No anomalies, malware, or security concerns are identified.",
