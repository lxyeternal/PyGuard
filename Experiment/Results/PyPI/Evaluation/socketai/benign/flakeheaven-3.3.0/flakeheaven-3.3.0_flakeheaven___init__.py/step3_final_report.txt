{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports functions and version info from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._cli and ._version modules, no external data or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static import statements with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper module for Flake8, importing functions and version info, then defining __all__. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
