{
  "purpose": "This code appears to serve as a wrapper or entry point for a Flake8 plugin or tool, providing a configurable interface.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions 'entrypoint' and 'flake8_entrypoint' from a local module '_cli', and '__version__' from another local module '_version'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or security-critical operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining __all__, which controls the public interface of the module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that defines its public interface with __all__ and imports internal functions and version info. It contains no user input, no network calls, and no suspicious code segments. The absence of executable logic or external data handling reduces any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python module used for wrapping or configuring Flake8 functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
