{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration constants, enumerations, and a mapping of plugin names to URLs for a Python project named 'flakeheaven'. It primarily sets default settings, status codes, and known plugin sources.",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions, including import statements, default configuration dictionaries, enum class, and a read-only mapping of plugin names to URLs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications. No untrusted data processing or output is evident.",
  "flows": "The code simply sets up static data structures and constants. There are no data flows involving untrusted input or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior. All code appears to be straightforward, static definitions. The mapping of plugin names to URLs could potentially be used for validation or informational purposes, but by itself does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a local version module. It defines default configuration options in a dictionary, which is safe. The ExitCode enum maps various status codes, also safe. The KNOWN_PLUGINS mapping uses MappingProxyType to create an immutable dictionary of plugin names and their URLs, which is safe. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is purely declarative, static configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a static configuration and constants setup for a Python project. There are no indicators of malware or security issues.",
