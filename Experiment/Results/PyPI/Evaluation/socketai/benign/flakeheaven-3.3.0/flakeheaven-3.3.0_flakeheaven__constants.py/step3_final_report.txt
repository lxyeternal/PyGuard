  "purpose": "Static configuration module defining defaults, exit codes, and plugin URLs for the package.",
  "sources": "Constants, enum definitions, and the MappingProxyType of plugin URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data without data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static data structures and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script with constants, an enum for exit codes, and an immutable mapping of plugin names to URLs. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The plugin URLs are legitimate GitHub repositories, serving as references. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The use of MappingProxyType ensures immutability and safety. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
