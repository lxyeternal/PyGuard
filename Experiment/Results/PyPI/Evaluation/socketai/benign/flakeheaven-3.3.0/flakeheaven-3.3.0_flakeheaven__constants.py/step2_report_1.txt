  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration module. There are no signs of dynamic behavior, data processing, or external input handling. The code only defines constants, enums, and an immutable mapping of plugin URLs. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. This aligns with the code content. No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning. They correctly note the use of `MappingProxyType` for immutability and the static nature of the data.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.  \n- Obfuscated score: All assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.  \n- Risk score: All assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\nNo adjustments needed here.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNone of the reports suggest any reason to assign a risk score above 0.5. The code is purely declarative and safe.\n\n**5. Malware Score Considerations**  \nSince the code contains only static configuration data, no malware or malicious activity is present. The reports' malware scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as safe. No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores and Analysis**  \nScores are consistent with the detailed reasoning provided. The assessments align with the code's static, safe nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code is a typical configuration module with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious code. The use of `MappingProxyType` for the plugin URL mapping is a good practice, ensuring immutability and safety.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current assessments are accurate and justified. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
