{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration constants, enums, and plugin support for the 'flakeheaven' Python code quality tool.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, internal version module, and a module attribute __version__; constants and mappings defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains operations that process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up static configurations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration and enum definitions, with static data structures like dictionaries and mappings. It imports version information and defines plugin URLs and plugin support mappings. The use of MappingProxyType ensures immutability of plugin URLs. No dynamic execution, external data processing, or network communication is present. Overall, it appears to be a standard setup module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration setup for the 'flakeheaven' tool, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
