{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration settings, enumerations, and a read-only mapping of known plugin URLs for a Python project related to code quality and style enforcement.",
  "sources": "- Import statements for standard libraries and internal version info.\n- Constant definitions (NAME, VERSION, DEFAULTS).\n- Class definition for ExitCode.\n- Declaration of KNOWN_PLUGINS as a read-only dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present. The code mainly sets static configuration data and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data manipulations; the code only establishes static configurations and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code contains standard configuration setup with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a configuration module defining defaults, enumerations for exit codes, and a static, immutable mapping of plugin names to URLs. It uses standard Python practices such as Enum and MappingProxyType. No user input handling, network connections, or data processing is present. The only notable aspect is the use of MappingProxyType for a safe, immutable plugin URL map, which is a standard practice for safeguarding static data. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe configuration setup module with no malicious or suspicious elements. It establishes static data structures and constants for use elsewhere. No security risks are identified.",
