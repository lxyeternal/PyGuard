  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration defaults, plugin support, and enumerations for a Python code quality tool called 'flakeheaven'.",
  "sources": "Import statements, module-level constants, and a known plugins dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None present; no direct data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of constants and data structures; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected. The KNOWN_PLUGINS mapping is a static, read-only proxy for plugin URLs, which appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of standard Python import statements, constant definitions, an enumeration for exit codes, and a read-only dictionary of plugin names mapped to URLs. The code uses safe practices such as using MappingProxyType for immutability. No dynamic code execution, external data input handling, or network activity is present. The data structures and logic are straightforward and typical for configuration modules. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for a Python linting tool, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign component defining constants and known plugin URLs, used for reference or configuration purposes.",
