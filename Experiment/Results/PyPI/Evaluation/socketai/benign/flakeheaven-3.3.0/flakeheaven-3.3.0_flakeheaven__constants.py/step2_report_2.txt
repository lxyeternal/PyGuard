  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It defines static configuration data: defaults, exit codes, and a mapping of plugin names to URLs.\n- Uses standard Python constructs: constants, Enum, MappingProxyType for immutability.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated logic.\n- All plugin URLs point to legitimate GitHub repositories.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code appears clean and free of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or insecure data handling.\n- The static data structures and constants are straightforward and safe.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The use of `MappingProxyType` is appropriate for making the plugin URL mapping immutable.\n- No issues with the code structure or implementation.\n\n### Scores Given in Reports:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0 across all reports.\n- Confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty in the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- The static, read-only configuration data and safe practices support these scores.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The plugin URLs are legitimate and serve as references, not executable code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static code review.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely static configuration data, with no dynamic or malicious components. The use of standard safe practices further confirms its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code and reports collectively indicate a safe, well-structured configuration module with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
