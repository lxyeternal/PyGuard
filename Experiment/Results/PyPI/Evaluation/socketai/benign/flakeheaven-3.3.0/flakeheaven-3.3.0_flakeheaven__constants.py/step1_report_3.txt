{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, enums, and a read-only mapping of known plugins for a Python package related to code quality and linting tools, with no evident runtime logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Imports of built-in modules (enum, types), local version info, and the static declaration of constants, classes, and a known plugins mapping.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed, stored, or transmitted. No input/output handling, network operations, or command execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks. The code primarily establishes static data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The known plugins mapping is static and read-only, with URLs pointing to legitimate GitHub repositories. No dynamic code execution, system commands, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a configuration and constants module for a Python package, defining version info, default settings, exit codes, and a static, immutable list of supported plugin repositories. It does not contain runtime logic, user input handling, or network communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The data appears to be safe and straightforward, used for package configuration and plugin management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module setting up constants, enumerations, and a known plugins list for a Python code quality tool. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intentionally designed for package setup and plugin reference.",
