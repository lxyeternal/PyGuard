  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code imports `Tuple` and `Union` from `typing`, and `ExitCode` from a local module `_constants`.\n   - It defines a type alias `CommandResult` as a tuple: `(Union[int, ExitCode], str)`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is a straightforward type alias for representing command execution results.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code does not read input, process data, or perform any operations.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this snippet.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Reported Scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - This is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n\n4. **Assessment of Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a type alias with no runtime behavior, no security risk or malware is present.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a benign type alias.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made; conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard type alias definition for command results.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain component appears safe, with no indication of malware or vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
