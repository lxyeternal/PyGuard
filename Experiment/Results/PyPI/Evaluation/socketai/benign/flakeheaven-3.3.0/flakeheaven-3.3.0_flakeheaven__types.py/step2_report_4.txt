  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\n# built-in\nfrom typing import Tuple, Union\n\n# app\nfrom ._constants import ExitCode\n\nCommandResult = Tuple[Union[int, ExitCode], str]\n```\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code defines a type alias `CommandResult` for a tuple containing either an `int` or `ExitCode` and a `str`.\n- It imports standard typing modules and a local constant `ExitCode`.\n- There are no functions, no data processing, no I/O, no external data sources or sinks.\n- The code appears to be purely structural, intended for type hinting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that this is a straightforward type alias definition with no suspicious behavior. There are no errors, flaws, or malicious code detected.\n\n- **Any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is minimal, correct, and standard for type alias definitions.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk)?**  \n  All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since the code only defines a type alias and imports, and no malicious activity is evident, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present; a score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The code is purely structural, with no external interactions or vulnerabilities. A risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that there are no assumptions or vulnerabilities based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is benign and standard.**  \n- **All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) should remain at 0.**  \n- **Confidence is high (1.0), given the simplicity and clarity.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
