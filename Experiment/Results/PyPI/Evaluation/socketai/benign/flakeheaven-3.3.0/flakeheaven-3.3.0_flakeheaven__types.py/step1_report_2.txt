{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias for command execution results consisting of a status code and a message.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from typing import Tuple, Union' and 'from ._constants import ExitCode'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias definition with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules and a local constant, then defines a type alias 'CommandResult' as a tuple containing either an integer or a custom ExitCode and a string. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is minimal and purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard type alias definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely provides a structure for command result representation.",
