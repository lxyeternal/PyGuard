  "purpose": "Define a type alias for command execution results as a tuple containing an integer or ExitCode and a string message.",
  "sources": "The code imports built-in 'typing' module for type annotations and a local module '_constants' for ExitCode.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code merely defines a type alias; there are no data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local constant, then defines a type alias 'CommandResult' as a tuple of (int or ExitCode, str). There are no functions, data processing, or I/O operations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be part of a larger project, serving as a type hint for command execution results.",
