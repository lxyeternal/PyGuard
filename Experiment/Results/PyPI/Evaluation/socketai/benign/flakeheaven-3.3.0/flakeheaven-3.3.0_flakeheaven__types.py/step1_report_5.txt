  "purpose": "Define a type alias for command execution results, representing an integer or ExitCode and a string message.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is purely defining a type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard type alias definition with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing constructs and a local constant, then defines a type alias for command results as a tuple of either int or ExitCode and a string. There is no input, output, or dynamic behavior, nor any suspicious or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type alias definition used for clarity and type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
