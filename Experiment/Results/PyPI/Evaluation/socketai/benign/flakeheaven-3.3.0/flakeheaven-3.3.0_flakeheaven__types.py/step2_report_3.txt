  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - All reports describe the code as defining a type alias `CommandResult` as a tuple `(Union[int, ExitCode], str)`.\n   - The code imports `Tuple`, `Union` from `typing` and `ExitCode` from a local module `_constants`.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their description.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a straightforward type alias definition.\n   - No flawed reasoning or incorrect assumptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which seems justified due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malicious Activity:**\n   - Since the code only defines a type alias, there's no malware, malicious intent, or security risk.\n   - The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, benign type alias definition.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code fragment is entirely safe and standard for type hinting purposes in Python projects.",
