  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code defines a type alias `CommandResult` as a tuple containing either an `int` or `ExitCode`, and a `str`.\n   - The code only imports standard typing modules and a local constant `_constants.ExitCode`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as a type hint for command execution results.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - None of the reports find any anomalies, suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for type annotations in Python projects.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Confidence is 1.0 across all reports, which is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is a simple type alias, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n   - The reports correctly identify that there's no malicious activity or security risk.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all reports are accurate.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The only point of note is that the code depends on `_constants.ExitCode`. If `_constants` is malicious or compromised, that could introduce risk, but based solely on this snippet, we cannot assess that.\n   - The `ExitCode` is presumably an enum or similar construct, which is standard practice.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, straightforward type alias definition with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
