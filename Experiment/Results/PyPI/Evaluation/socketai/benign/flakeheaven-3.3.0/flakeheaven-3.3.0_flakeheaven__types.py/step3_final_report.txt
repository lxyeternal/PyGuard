  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'CommandResult' as a tuple containing either an integer or ExitCode, and a string, representing command execution results.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' module and local '_constants' module; no runtime data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a static type alias with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type alias with standard imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules and a local ExitCode constant, then defines a type alias 'CommandResult' as a tuple of (Union[int, ExitCode], str). It contains no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity. Confidence is high (1.0). The code's benign nature and standard structure justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type alias definition with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent with its straightforward nature. No further action is necessary.",
