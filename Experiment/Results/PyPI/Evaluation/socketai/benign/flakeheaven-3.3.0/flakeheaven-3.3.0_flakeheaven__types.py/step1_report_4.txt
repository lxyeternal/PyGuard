  "flows": "N/A – no data flows are established within this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing utilities and a local constant, then defines a type alias 'CommandResult'. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and typical for type hinting purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and standard type alias definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
