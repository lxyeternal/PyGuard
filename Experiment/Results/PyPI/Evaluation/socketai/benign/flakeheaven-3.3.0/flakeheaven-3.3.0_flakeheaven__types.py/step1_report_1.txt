  "purpose": "Define a type alias for command execution results consisting of an integer or ExitCode and a message string.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing for type annotations and a local module '_constants' for ExitCode. It defines a tuple type alias 'CommandResult' that represents a command execution result, combining a status code (int or ExitCode) and a string message. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be standard type alias definition without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type alias definition used for representing command results. No malicious activity, security risks, or suspicious behavior are present.",
