  "purpose": "The code provides various functions and classes for processing and analyzing street network geometries and building footprints, including polygonization, network simplification, face artifact detection, and topology cleaning.",
  "sources": "Reads building geometries from GeoDataFrames, street network geometries, and node/edge attributes for network analysis. Uses imported libraries for spatial analysis, geometry manipulation, and statistical modeling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur through the use of network and geometry data, but no explicit data exfiltration or network communication functions are present. No code injection or unsafe eval statements are used. No direct data leaks or privacy violations are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from GeoDataFrames through processing functions such as polygonization, spatial joins, network topology cleaning, and geometric transformations. No untrusted external input is directly processed; all data appears to be internal or passed as function arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code uses standard spatial analysis techniques, and no suspicious network calls or file manipulations are detected. The code contains extensive geometry processing, but this is typical for geospatial analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises multiple functions and classes focused on spatial data processing: polygonization, gap closing, line extension, intersection consolidation, face artifact detection, and network simplification. It relies on well-known libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, SciPy, and NetworkX, with no evidence of malicious modifications or suspicious patterns. All operations are consistent with spatial data workflows; no hardcoded secrets, hidden network calls, or malicious data handling are detected. The functions operate on geometry objects and DataFrames, with standard spatial algorithms. The FaceArtifacts class performs statistical analysis to identify geometric anomalies, and no malicious behaviors are evident in its implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured geospatial processing toolkit with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs common spatial analysis patterns without any suspicious behaviors, hidden network activity, or obfuscated code. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal.",
