{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive spatial analysis toolkit for urban morphology, street network processing, and face artifact detection, utilizing standard open-source geospatial libraries.",
  "sources": "In-memory data within geopandas GeoDataFrames; no external data sources or network communication.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network activity, or file writing; all data processing occurs locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within memory, passing through geometric and topological routines without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; routines are standard for GIS analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard spatial libraries (geopandas, shapely, networkx, scipy, esda.shape) to perform polygonization, topology cleaning, geometry extension, and face artifact detection. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The logic is domain-specific and legitimate, with complex routines typical for urban morphology analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific spatial analysis toolkit with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
