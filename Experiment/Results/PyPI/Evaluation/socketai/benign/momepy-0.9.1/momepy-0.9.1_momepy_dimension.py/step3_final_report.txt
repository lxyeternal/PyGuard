{
  "purpose": "Provides spatial analysis metrics such as area, perimeter, volume, and related characteristics for geospatial data using standard libraries like geopandas, shapely, and libpysal.",
  "sources": "Reads data from GeoDataFrame attributes, geometry objects, and external libraries; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Operates solely on local data within GeoDataFrames; no external data leaks, network communication, or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Calculations flow from GeoDataFrame geometries and attributes through wrapper classes to produce series of metrics; no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated and removed decorators indicates maintenance updates, not malicious intent; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for spatial metrics, wrapping standard geopandas operations (area, length, convex hull, etc.). No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. Use of deprecated decorators is for code maintenance. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The code relies on well-known libraries and performs straightforward calculations. No external inputs or outputs suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate spatial analysis utilities with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) due to maintenance-related decorators are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
