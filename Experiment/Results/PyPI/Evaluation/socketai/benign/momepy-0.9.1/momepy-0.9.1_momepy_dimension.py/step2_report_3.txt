  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code behavior, potential security issues, malware presence, obfuscation, and logical consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard spatial calculations using geopandas, shapely, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, just use of deprecated decorators.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward geospatial functions, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to deprecated decorators and version management)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on geospatial analysis functions.  \n- No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious code.  \n- Uses standard libraries and methods.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate, no significant security concern)  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, standard spatial data analysis classes.  \n- No external data leaks, network, or malicious operations.  \n- Uses well-known open-source libraries.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar pattern: spatial characteristic calculations with standard libraries.  \n- No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code.  \n- Use of deprecated decorators is benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also a set of spatial analysis classes with no external or malicious behavior.  \n- No suspicious code, no external data leaks, no network activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, mainly due to deprecated decorators, which is a maintenance concern, not a security risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports, justified by the use of deprecated decorators and version checks, but these are not security threats.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports. No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.2), justified by maintenance-related decorators and version checks, not security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (mainly due to deprecated decorators, which are benign but indicate code aging)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate given the code's nature. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the risk scores reflect minor maintenance concerns rather than security threats.",
