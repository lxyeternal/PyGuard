  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate spatial analysis utilities with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) due to maintenance-related decorators are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose."
