{
  "purpose": "This code provides various geospatial and morphological character calculations for GeoDataFrames, such as area, perimeter, volume, and other spatial metrics used for analysis in geospatial datasets.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from GeoDataFrame objects, their geometries, and external libraries (geopandas, shapely, numpy, pandas, scipy, tqdm, packaging). It also reads spatial weights and geometry attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that could lead to data leakage, system harm, or malicious actions. It mainly performs spatial calculations and data manipulations.",
  "flows": "Sources (GeoDataFrames, geometries, external libraries) feed into calculation methods, with data being processed and stored in class attributes (like series). No data flows into unsafe or external sinks or commands that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code relies on well-known spatial libraries and standard data processing techniques. There is no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Usage of deprecated decorators and detailed progress bars is present but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for calculating spatial metrics based on GeoDataFrame geometries. It uses standard libraries for geospatial analysis and includes progress reporting. No external inputs are taken from untrusted sources at runtime. No network activity, file writing, or system modification commands are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. All operations are typical for spatial data processing, and no suspicious patterns or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of spatial analysis tools that operate purely on geospatial data without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is well-structured, relies on open-source libraries, and performs standard calculations. There are no signs of malware, malicious data flows, or security risks.",
