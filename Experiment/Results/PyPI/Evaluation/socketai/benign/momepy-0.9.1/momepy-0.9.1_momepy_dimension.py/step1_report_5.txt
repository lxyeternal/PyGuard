  "purpose": "Define various spatial and geometric analysis classes for geospatial data, including area, perimeter, volume, and neighborhood-based calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (math, geopandas, numpy, pandas, scipy, shapely, packaging, tqdm, internal shape and utils). Reads GeoDataFrame geometries, spatial weights, and data columns.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from GeoDataFrame columns and external libraries for spatial analysis. No untrusted data sinks like network or file writing observed.",
  "flows": "Reads geometry, data columns, and spatial weights. Performs calculations on geometries and attributes. Does not pass data to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows detected. Extensive use of deprecated and removed decorators but no malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Uses progress bars for iterations, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code provides spatial analysis classes for geospatial data, performing calculations such as area, perimeter, volume, and neighborhood statistics. It utilizes common libraries like geopandas, shapely, and libpysal. The code appears to be part of a spatial analysis toolkit, with no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system disruption. The use of deprecated and removed decorators suggests maintenance and backward compatibility considerations. No suspicious code anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident. The code structure and logic are consistent with standard geospatial analysis functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geospatial analysis module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs spatial calculations and neighborhood analyses securely without external communications or data leaks. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected.",
