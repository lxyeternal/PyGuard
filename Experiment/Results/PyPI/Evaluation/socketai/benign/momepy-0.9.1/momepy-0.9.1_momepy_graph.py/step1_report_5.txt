{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to analyze the connectivity and centrality properties of street networks represented as NetworkX graphs, including calculating node degrees, meshedness, centrality measures, and subgraph-based metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from NetworkX graph objects and their attributes; no external input sources or untrusted data are explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Writes computed metrics to node or edge attributes within the NetworkX graph; no data leaks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Processes involve copying graphs, iterating over nodes and edges, calculating metrics, and setting attributes. No external data flows are detected beyond these local computations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Functions and calculations are standard for network analysis. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of network analysis utility functions that perform standard calculations on street network graphs. It imports well-known libraries (networkx, numpy, pandas, tqdm) and uses them appropriately. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections, or manipulation of system files. The functions focus solely on graph analysis, with no code that could execute external commands, access environment variables maliciously, or perform covert activities. All operations are contained within the scope of network metric calculations, and attribute manipulations are straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of network analysis tools designed for urban street network analysis. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and performs typical analysis tasks without suspicious patterns.",
