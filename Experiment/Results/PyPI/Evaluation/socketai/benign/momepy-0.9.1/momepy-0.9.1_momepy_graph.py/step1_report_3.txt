{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for analyzing connectivity and centrality metrics in street network graphs using NetworkX, including subgraph extraction, centrality calculations, and other graph metrics.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from networkx graph objects, including node attributes, edge attributes, and graph structure (number of nodes and edges). It also uses tqdm for progress indication.",
  "sinks": "The code writes computed metrics back to node attributes in the graph, including centrality, meshedness, cul-de-sac length, proportions, and density measures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from graph data structures (nodes and edges) to calculations of metrics, and results are stored back into node or edge attributes within the graph object.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code performs standard graph analysis tasks. No network communications, file access, or external data operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules for graph analysis and numerical calculations. All functions perform standard graph metric calculations using networkx and numpy, with no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior. The functions read node and edge attributes and write metrics back into the graph structure, which is typical for such analysis scripts. No network activity, system calls, or external data transmissions are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate analytical toolkit for graph-based street network analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard analytical module for street network graph metrics, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It operates purely on in-memory graph data structures and uses well-known libraries for analysis.",
