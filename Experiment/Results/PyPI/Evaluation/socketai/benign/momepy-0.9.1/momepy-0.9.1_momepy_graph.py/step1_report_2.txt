{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of functions to analyze and compute various connectivity and centrality metrics on street network graphs represented with NetworkX.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input graph objects (networkx.Graph) passed as parameters; no external data sources are directly accessed or read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that send data to external servers, write files, or perform network communication. All operations are confined to in-memory graph processing.",
  "flows": "The functions process the input graph by copying, analyzing subgraphs, and setting node or edge attributes; no external data flows or outputs are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code uses standard libraries for graph analysis, math, and data handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs in-memory analysis of street network graphs, computing metrics like node degree, meshedness, clustering, centrality measures, and proportions of intersection types. It relies on standard libraries (networkx, numpy, pandas, tqdm) for computations and progress visualization. The functions do not include any network calls, file I/O, or system commands. There are no signs of malicious behaviors like data theft, remote control, or covert channels. The code appears well-structured, with clear, purpose-driven functions for spatial network analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of graph analysis functions for street networks, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It operates solely on in-memory data structures, uses standard libraries, and has no suspicious or hidden behaviors.",
