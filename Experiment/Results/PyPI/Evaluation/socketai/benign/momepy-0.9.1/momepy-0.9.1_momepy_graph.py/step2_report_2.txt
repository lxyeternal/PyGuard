  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Describes functions for analyzing street network graphs—calculating node degree, meshedness, centralities, ratios, etc. No external data or network activity.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** Uses standard libraries (networkx, numpy, pandas, tqdm). No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, standard analysis code with high confidence (1.0). No malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Similar analysis functions, focusing on in-memory graph processing. No external data sources or network activity.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** Uses standard libraries, no suspicious code, no external communication.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence (1.0). No malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Same as above—calculates graph metrics, modifies graph attributes.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** No external data access, no suspicious code. Standard processing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, high confidence (1.0). No malware or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code is a typical analysis toolkit.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Analyzes street network graphs, computes metrics, and updates attributes.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** No external communication, no obfuscation, uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0). No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Same as above—graph analysis functions, standard metrics.\n- **Behavior & Anomalies:** No external data access, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still very high. No signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard, transparent analysis suite.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a set of analysis functions operating solely on in-memory NetworkX graphs.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external network activity. The code relies on standard libraries and performs typical calculations.\n- **Security Risks:** The minimal risk stems from potential misuse (e.g., passing malicious attribute names or parameters), but this is inherent in any flexible code handling user input. No active threats or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, well-structured, and transparent code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low; mainly theoretical if misused.\n- **Scores Justification:** Given the thorough review, the code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard set of network analysis functions for street networks, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It operates entirely within the scope of graph analysis, using well-established libraries and methods.",
