{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for analyzing and calculating various connectivity and centrality metrics on street network graphs, primarily using NetworkX.",
  "sources": "Reads graph data, node attributes, edge attributes, and optional input parameters such as radius, length, and distance attributes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs modified graph objects with new or updated node and edge attributes; no external data or network connections are involved.",
  "flows": "Reads graph structures and attributes; performs calculations like subgraph extraction, centrality, and ratios; updates graph node and edge attributes accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No attempts at code obfuscation or misleading variable names. The code relies entirely on standard libraries and NetworkX functions without unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs graph analysis tasks: it copies input graphs, computes various metrics (node degree, meshedness, centralities, ratios, etc.), and assigns results to node or edge attributes. It uses progress bars for loops, standard mathematical formulas, and established graph theory methods. No external network activity, file I/O, or data exfiltration routines are present. All functions are clearly documented, and the logic aligns with typical spatial network analysis procedures. The only potential concern could be the use of user-supplied parameters for attribute names or radius, but these do not introduce malicious behavior, only data handling flexibility.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive suite of network analysis functions for street networks, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It solely relies on standard scientific computation and graph analysis techniques, with no external communications or harmful operations detected.",
