{
  "purpose": "This code implements the COINS algorithm to analyze and generate stroke geometries from street network data in a GeoDataFrame, mainly for urban morphology analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'edge_gdf' GeoDataFrame, which contains street network geometries, and uses internal data structures derived from the input, such as coordinates and topology information.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include GeoDataFrames with stroke geometries and pandas Series with stroke group attributes. No untrusted data sinks (e.g., network transmission, file writing) are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input geometries are processed into line segments, which are then analyzed for connectivity and angles. The resulting merged geometries and attribute Series are generated based on this processed data, with no data flow to external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, secrets, or suspicious obfuscated code. Usage of warnings for potential line issues is standard. No indications of hidden backdoors or malicious modifications. The code uses standard libraries and techniques for spatial data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly processes spatial data using well-known libraries (geopandas, shapely, numpy). It splits lines into segments, calculates angles, identifies connectivity, and merges lines into strokes. All operations are geometric and topological, with no external network or system command execution. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors, are observed. The use of warnings is benign, aimed at data consistency. The functions and class methods perform standard spatial data manipulations. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code is comprehensive, structured, and focused on geometric analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard spatial data processing tool implementing the COINS algorithm with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It focuses solely on analyzing street network geometries, with no dangerous or covert operations detected.",
