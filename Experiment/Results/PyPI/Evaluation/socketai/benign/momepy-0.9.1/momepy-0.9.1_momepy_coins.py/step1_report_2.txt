{
  "purpose": "This code implements the COINS algorithm to analyze street network geometries, calculate street continuities, and generate stroke groupings as GeoDataFrames and pandas Series.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a GeoDataFrame ('edge_gdf') containing edge geometries and CRS information, as well as internal data structures for line segments, coordinate pairs, and connectivity links.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the generation of GeoDataFrames with geometries, attributes, and stroke groups; and the calculation of angles between line segments for connectivity analysis.",
  "flows": "Input from 'edge_gdf' is processed through line splitting, linking, and angle calculations, leading to the creation of merged stroke geometries and attribute Series, which are then returned by public methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive geometric processing without hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious intent. No suspicious external network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's structure and operations are typical for spatial analysis workflows.",
  "analysis": "The script is a well-structured implementation of a spatial analysis algorithm with no indications of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The methods involve geometry manipulation, connectivity calculations, and data frame generation, all standard in geospatial processing. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or malicious data leaks are found. The code avoids insecure operations, and the only warnings concern geometric assumptions. No external network interactions or system modifications are present. The code appears focused solely on analyzing and grouping street geometries.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard geospatial processing implementation for street network analysis. It contains no malicious behaviors or supply chain security risks. It performs geometric calculations and data organization typical for spatial analysis tasks. No malware or malicious intent is evident, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
