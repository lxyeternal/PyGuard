  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent spatial analysis implementation with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and well-structured. The security risk score should be very low, around 0.1, primarily due to the processing of spatial data but with no actual security threat present."
