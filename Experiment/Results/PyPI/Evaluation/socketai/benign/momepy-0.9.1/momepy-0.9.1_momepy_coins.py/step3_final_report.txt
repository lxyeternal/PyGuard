  "purpose": "This Python script implements the COINS algorithm to analyze street network topology from spatial edge data, generating stroke groupings based on geometric and topological continuity.",
  "sources": "Reads input GeoDataFrame containing LineString geometries representing street edges; processes geometries internally without external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; all processing occurs in-memory within Python, with no network communication or file I/O beyond in-memory data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input GeoDataFrame through line splitting, angle calculations, connectivity analysis, and merging steps, without external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Warnings relate to geometric data issues, which are standard in spatial data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard spatial data operations: splitting lines into segments, calculating angles between segments, establishing connectivity based on angle thresholds and flow mode, and merging segments into strokes. It uses common libraries (geopandas, shapely, numpy, pandas) and contains no external network calls, file writes, or system modifications. No obfuscated code patterns or secrets are present. The logic is transparent and domain-specific, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent spatial analysis implementation with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and well-structured. The security risk score should be very low, around 0.1, primarily due to the processing of spatial data but with no actual security threat present.",
