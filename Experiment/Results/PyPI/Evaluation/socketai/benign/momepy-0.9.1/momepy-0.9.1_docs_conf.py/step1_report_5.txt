  "purpose": "Configuration and setup for the Sphinx documentation builder for the momepy project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (os, sys, momepy), environment variables, and comments indicating potential future imports or configurations.",
  "sinks": "sys.path insertion, environment variable access (os.environ.get), linkcode_resolve function generating URLs, setup function adding CSS files.",
  "flows": "sys.path insertion and environment variables influence module import paths and URL generation; linkcode_resolve uses module introspection to generate source links.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of environment variable to define URL base could be benign or malicious but appears standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or malicious network activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file setting up extensions, themes, paths, and URL mappings. It imports 'os', 'sys', and 'momepy', then manipulates sys.path and environment variables for URL construction. The linkcode_resolve function dynamically generates source code URLs based on module introspection, which is a common practice in documentation systems. No suspicious code patterns, no external network connections or data leaks are present. The use of environment variables is typical for build configurations. Overall, the code appears to be benign and intended for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior detected. It appropriately manages paths, extensions, themes, and source linking for documentation purposes. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
