  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder for the momepy project.",
  "sources": "import os, sys, and momepy modules; environment variables; commented out and active code snippets within the configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or data leak points.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration with no suspicious code or backdoors. Commented-out code and environment variable references are typical for such configs. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network connections, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports necessary modules, sets up project info, extensions, themes, output options, and environment variables. No input parsing, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The commented sections and environment variables are standard practice. The code does not contain any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard documentation configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate setup for generating project documentation with no security concerns.",
