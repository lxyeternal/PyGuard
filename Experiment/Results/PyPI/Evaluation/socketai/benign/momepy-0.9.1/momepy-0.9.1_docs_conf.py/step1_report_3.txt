  "purpose": "Configuration and setup script for Sphinx documentation builder for the momepy project.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys; reads environment variables; loads momepy module; reads local files (e.g., _static/references.bib); accesses environment variables (READTHEDOCS_CANONICAL_URL).",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables (READTHEDOCS_CANONICAL_URL, READTHEDOCS) that could influence output or behavior; constructs URLs dynamically in linkcode_resolve; potentially exposes local file paths or module source code via URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to configure URLs; sys.path is modified to include a parent directory; source files are accessed for source code linking; environment variables influence URL generation; local files and modules are imported and referenced.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of environment variables to generate URLs is standard for documentation links, not malicious. All code appears to be typical configuration code; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with extensive setup for themes, extensions, output formats, and URL linking. It imports modules, reads environment variables, and defines functions for source code linking, which are common in documentation projects. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are present. The use of environment variables for URL configuration is normal for deployment environments. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks beyond typical configuration parameters.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
