  "purpose": "Configuration and setup script for generating documentation using Sphinx for the 'momepy' project.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries (os, sys), sys.path modification, import of 'momepy' module, environment variables (os.environ.get), commented out import statements, and code within setup functions.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modifications, environment variables, source code resolution in 'linkcode_resolve' function, inclusion of external URLs, and static resource references.",
  "flows": "sys.path.insert -> import momepy -> setup function with add_css_file -> linkcode_resolve sourcing module attributes -> environment variables influencing URL base.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Commented-out imports and code are benign placeholders. No network connections, data leaks, or suspicious external requests present.",
  "analysis": "This script primarily handles configuration for Sphinx documentation generation, including module imports, path setup, theme configuration, extension inclusion, and environment variable usage. The 'linkcode_resolve' function dynamically determines source URLs for documentation links, which is standard in Sphinx setups. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. Use of environment variables is limited to URL base configuration and does not pose security issues. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
