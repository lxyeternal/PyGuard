  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder for the momepy project.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys; inserts path; imports momepy; reads environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.modules, inspect functions, and environment variables, but only for legitimate source code resolution and configuration purposes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and source code metadata are used to resolve source links; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code primarily handles documentation configuration, path management, and environment settings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration for Sphinx documentation, importing modules, setting theme options, and defining helper functions. No evidence of malicious payloads, code injections, or backdoors. Functions like linkcode_resolve safely determine source file locations. Environment variables are used in a read-only manner to set URLs, with no untrusted data execution. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration script for documentation purposes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages paths, themes, and link resolution in a controlled, safe manner.",
