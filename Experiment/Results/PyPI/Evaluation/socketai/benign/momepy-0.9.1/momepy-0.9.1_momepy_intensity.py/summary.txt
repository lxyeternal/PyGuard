  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate spatial analysis toolkit with no malicious or sabotage features. It relies on standard open-source libraries, performs in-memory computations, and contains no network or system command operations. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, the supply chain security for this dependency is sound."
