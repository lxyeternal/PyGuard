{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a testing environment by importing libraries (geopandas and momepy) and injecting them into the doctest namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements for geopandas and momepy, and the add_momepy_and_geopandas fixture function that accesses doctest_namespace.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "Import statements load external libraries; the fixture function injects these modules into the doctest namespace without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; the code primarily sets up testing dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two external libraries (geopandas and momepy), then defines a pytest fixture that automatically runs to add these modules into the doctest namespace. There are no indications of data flow from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious operations. The code appears to be a standard testing setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for testing with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply imports libraries and prepares a testing environment.",
