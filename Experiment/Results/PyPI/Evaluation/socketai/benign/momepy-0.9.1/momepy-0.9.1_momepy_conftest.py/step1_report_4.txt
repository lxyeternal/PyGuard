{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a test environment by importing geopandas and momepy libraries and adds them to the doctest namespace for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'geopandas' and 'momepy', and the 'add_momepy_and_geopandas' fixture function which accesses these modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or influence external systems; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; the fixture adds references to 'momepy' and 'geopandas' into the testing namespace, with no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of standard library functions and testing fixtures is normal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports two common geospatial libraries and defines a pytest fixture to add these modules into the testing environment. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or sensitive data handling. The structure is typical for a test setup, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports libraries and makes them available for tests. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
