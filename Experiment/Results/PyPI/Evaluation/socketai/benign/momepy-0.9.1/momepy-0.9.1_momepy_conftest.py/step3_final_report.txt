  "purpose": "Set up testing environment by injecting 'geopandas' and 'momepy' modules into the doctest namespace for pytest-based tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'geopandas' and 'momepy'; the fixture function accessing these modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> define fixture -> inject modules into namespace; no external data or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing well-known libraries and injecting them into the testing namespace via a pytest fixture. It does not perform any network communication, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted inputs. The purpose is solely for test setup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test fixture setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correct. No modifications are necessary.",
