  "purpose": "Set up a testing fixture to include momepy and geopandas modules in the doctest namespace",
  "sources": "Import statements for geopandas and momepy",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module imports and fixture setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports two libraries, geopandas and momepy, then defines a pytest fixture that automatically adds these modules to the doctest namespace. No dynamic code execution, no handling of external untrusted data, and no suspicious behavior are present. The purpose is purely for testing environment setup. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are involved. The code is minimal, clear, and standard for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign setup for testing with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard test fixture configuration with no malicious intent.",
