{
  "purpose": "Set up a testing environment by injecting 'momepy' and 'geopandas' modules into doctest namespace for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'geopandas' and 'momepy', and the fixture function accessing these modules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and fixture setup code with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two well-known Python libraries used for geospatial data processing and testing. It defines a pytest fixture that automatically injects these modules into the doctest namespace, facilitating testing scenarios. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. All elements are straightforward and conform to typical testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple purpose of setting up testing fixtures. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
