  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: importing `geopandas` and `momepy`, then defining an `autouse` pytest fixture that injects these modules into the `doctest_namespace`.\n- The code is straightforward, standard for setting up testing environments.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The code does not process untrusted inputs, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code and logic:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as the import statements and fixture setup.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find any malicious activity, which is accurate.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent; the code is simple and correct.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports uniformly assign maximum confidence (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- The risk score is consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of security concerns.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports correctly interpret the purpose as setting up a testing environment.\n- They appropriately conclude that the code is benign.\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores. The code is a standard testing fixture setup with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard testing setup.\n- Scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
