  "purpose": "Set up a testing fixture to inject momepy and geopandas modules into the doctest namespace for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for geopandas and momepy, and the pytest fixture that modifies the doctest namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; the fixture injects modules into the namespace during testing. No external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for setting up test fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two Python geospatial libraries, geopandas and momepy. It defines an autouse pytest fixture that automatically adds these modules into the doctest namespace. This setup facilitates testing of code snippets that depend on these libraries, without executing any malicious or harmful code. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is simple, standard for testing environments, and uses established patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for testing purposes, designed to inject modules into the testing environment. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
