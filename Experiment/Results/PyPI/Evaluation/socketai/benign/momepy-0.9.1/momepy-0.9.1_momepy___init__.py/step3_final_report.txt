  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by importing modules and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version retrieval via importlib.metadata, package metadata assignments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Imports and metadata assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from . import *' which can obscure namespace but is common in __init__.py files; no malicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file performing module imports and setting author/version info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The use of 'import *' is not ideal but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are detected. The version retrieval is safely suppressed if the package isn't installed. Overall, the code is benign and follows typical patterns for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package initializer with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk indicators. The current scores overstate risk; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the risk score should also be 0.",
