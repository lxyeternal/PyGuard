  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package, importing modules and setting metadata.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (since no issues are found, this seems appropriate).\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard package setup.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Package initialization with multiple imports and metadata.\n- **Findings:** Use of `from . import *` is noted as a potential concern but is common in __init__.py files; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly higher due to use of `import *`, but not malicious).\n- **Justification:** The minimal risk increase is justified; no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup with version retrieval.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Typical __init__.py with module imports and metadata.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** Standard code, no risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely static, performing module imports and setting metadata.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports find obfuscation; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Since all reports find no security issues, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. The only minor point is the use of `import *` in one report, which is not best practice but not malicious or risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard package setup code, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
