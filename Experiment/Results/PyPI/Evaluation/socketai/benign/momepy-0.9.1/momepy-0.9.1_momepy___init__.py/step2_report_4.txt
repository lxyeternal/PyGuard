  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, importing various modules and setting metadata.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The version retrieval uses `importlib.metadata.version` with `contextlib.suppress(PackageNotFoundError)`, which is common practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The use of `from . import *` is not recommended but is common in package __init__.py files and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code appears to be straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  Not in terms of security or malicious intent. The only minor critique is the use of `import *`, which can lead to namespace pollution but is not malicious.\n\n- **Scores given to issues?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.1 (due to the `import *`), which is reasonable.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities beyond standard package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- They correctly identify that this is a typical package __init__.py file with no malicious or security issues.  \n- The minor concern about `import *` is noted but not considered a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to use of `import *`, which is a minor issue but not security-critical)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard package initialization code, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No further action needed.",
