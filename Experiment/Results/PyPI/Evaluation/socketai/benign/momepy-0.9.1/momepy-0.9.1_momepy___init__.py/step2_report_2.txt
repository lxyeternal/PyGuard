  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a typical Python package __init__.py file.\n- It imports various internal modules and submodules.\n- Sets author info (__author__, __author_email__).\n- Attempts to retrieve the package version via `importlib.metadata.version(\"momepy\")`, suppressed if the package isn't found.\n- Uses relative imports, including `from . import datasets` and multiple `from .module import *`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code performs standard package initialization routines. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  The use of `from . import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is common in __init__.py files. It does not introduce security risks.\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, standard import and version retrieval.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. Same reasoning as above.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, notes use of `import *` but states it's not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (due to `import *`).  \n- **Analysis:** While `import *` is not ideal, it doesn't pose security risks. The minor securityRisk score is acceptable but could be zero since there's no evidence of malicious intent.  \n- **Suggestion:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0, as no actual risk is introduced.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. Standard package setup, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. Standard code, no issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious activity, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `from . import *`, which is common but not best practice. It does not introduce security risks.\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and security risks.\n\n### **Overall Risk and Malware Scores:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Recommendations:**\n- Keep scores as zero for malware and security risk.\n- Slightly reduce the `securityRisk` in Report 3 to 0, given the lack of actual risk.\n- The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.",
