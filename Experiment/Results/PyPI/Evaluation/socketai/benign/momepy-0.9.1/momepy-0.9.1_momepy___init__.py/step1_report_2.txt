{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a package's __init__.py file, used to import various modules and submodules for a Python package named 'momepy'.",
  "sources": "Module imports, author metadata, version retrieval via importlib.metadata, and suppression of PackageNotFoundError when retrieving version.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; no functions or operations that process external input or execute code based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and metadata retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The only external interaction is attempting to retrieve package version info within a suppressed exception context, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static imports of modules within the package, setting author metadata, and attempting to retrieve the package version with error suppression. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or code execution mechanisms present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are detected. The import statements and version retrieval are common patterns in Python package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard module imports and metadata setting, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
