  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any security concerns, potential malware, obfuscation, or logical flaws, and ensure the scoring aligns with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \n- Focuses on spatial metrics (Range, Theil, Simpson, Gini, Shannon, Unique, Percentiles).  \n- Uses external packages (`inequality`, `mapclassify`) with error handling.  \n- No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.  \n- Use of deprecated decorators indicates maintenance, not security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies and deprecations)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues with code logic or security.  \n- External dependencies are optional, handled with try-except.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report's scores are reasonable. The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on spatial diversity indices.  \n- Uses external packages (`mapclassify`, `inequality`) with error handling.  \n- No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious intent.  \n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, just dependencies and deprecations)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Well-structured, standard spatial analysis code.  \n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are justified; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \n- Similar focus: spatial diversity metrics, uses standard scientific libraries.  \n- Reads data from GeoDataFrame, no external communication.  \n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.  \n- Uses dynamic imports for optional packages, which is standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (due to external dependencies and optional imports)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious behavior detected.  \n- Code is typical for geospatial analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate; the code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \n- Similar to previous, with spatial diversity metrics, neighbor-based calculations.  \n- Uses external packages (`inequality`, `mapclassify`) with error handling.  \n- No network, system modification, or malicious behavior.  \n- No obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, dependencies and deprecations)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No suspicious activity.  \n- Standard scientific computation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are justified; code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \n- Same pattern: spatial and attribute diversity metrics, optional dependencies.  \n- No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.  \n- Uses dynamic imports and deprecations, typical for evolving libraries.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, dependencies and maintenance issues)  \n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are appropriate; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious code or behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard scientific code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting external dependencies and deprecations, but not security threats.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to dependencies and maintenance issues, not security threats)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is legitimate, well-structured, and intended for spatial data analysis. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain low risk scores, possibly tighten to 0.1–0.2 if desired, but current scores are reasonable. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**The code is safe, and the reports' assessments are justified.**",
