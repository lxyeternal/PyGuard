{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple classes and functions for calculating diversity indices and statistical measures within spatially weighted neighborhoods in geospatial data, primarily for analysis of morphological tessellations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from GeoDataFrame objects, pandas Series, and numpy arrays; accesses spatial weights matrices; imports external libraries for classification, inequality measures, and statistical calculations.",
  "sinks": "Returns Series and DataFrame objects containing computed indices; no evident data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from GeoDataFrame copies to local variables, processed through spatial neighbor selections, classification, and statistical computations; results are stored in Series/DataFrame objects, with no external data transmission or modification of system state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. Usage of deprecated decorators and optional imports is consistent with library development. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or hidden functionalities identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class and function definitions for spatial statistical calculations, employing standard libraries such as numpy, pandas, scipy, mapclassify, and inequality. The code performs neighbor-based data extraction, classification, and statistical computations, with progress bars for loops. No signs of malicious code like network communications, data exfiltration, system modification, or stealth behaviors are present. Use of deprecated decorators indicates ongoing library maintenance rather than malicious intent. External dependencies are properly imported with error handling. No suspicious data handling or external communication mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of spatial statistical analysis functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is consistent with library code intended for geographic data analysis. No security risks or malware indicators identified.",
