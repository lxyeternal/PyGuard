  "purpose": "Define various classes and functions for spatial and attribute-based diversity measures within a GeoDataFrame, using spatial weights for neighbor calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as gdf, values, spatial_weights, unique_id, and other configuration options; data extraction from GeoDataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if sensitive data is included in the input; use of external packages like inequality and mapclassify; no direct network, file, or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through calculations involving neighbor selections, statistical index computations, and optional data normalization or classification steps, then results are stored in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated decorators without evident impact; dynamic imports within functions for optional dependencies (e.g., inequality, mapclassify); no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides spatial diversity metrics based on neighbor relationships, utilizing external scientific libraries for index calculations. It performs data selection, normalization, classification, and statistical computations. Importantly, there are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, system modification, or obfuscation. Usage of dynamic imports and deprecated decorators are typical for optional dependencies and code evolution, respectively. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The overall security risk appears low. The code's structure is standard, and it handles data processing securely without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements diversity metrics for spatial data analysis in a standard, academically oriented manner. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is evident. External dependencies are optional and loaded dynamically, with no suspicious network or system actions. The security risk score is low, with high confidence.",
