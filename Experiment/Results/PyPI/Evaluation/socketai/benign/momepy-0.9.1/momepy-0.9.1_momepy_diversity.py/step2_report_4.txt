  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes spatial diversity metrics, relying on external packages (`inequality`, `mapclassify`), with data from GeoDataFrame columns.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. Use of deprecated decorators indicates maintenance, not malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate geospatial analysis code, high confidence (0.9), malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2 (due to external dependencies).\n\n**Verdict:** No malware or malicious behavior detected. The security risk is low, mainly due to optional external packages.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar spatial statistical functions, using standard libraries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network calls. Usage of deprecated decorators is typical for library maintenance.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate code, high confidence (0.9), malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior. Security risk minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Spatial diversity metrics, with standard data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. External dependencies are optional, with error handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on spatial attribute diversity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no network calls, no obfuscation. Use of deprecated decorators is for warnings.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9), malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Spatial and attribute diversity metrics, with optional dependencies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. Dynamic imports are standard for optional dependencies.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9), malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate **0**. No evidence of malicious code, network activity, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate **0**. Code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, primarily due to optional external dependencies and deprecated decorators, which are typical in open-source scientific code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the code appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and intended for spatial data analysis.** There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** (consistent with external dependencies and maintenance issues, not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security risks beyond standard dependency considerations.",
