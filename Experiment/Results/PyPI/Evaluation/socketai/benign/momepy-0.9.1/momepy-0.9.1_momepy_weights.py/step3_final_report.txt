  "purpose": "Provides spatial neighbor computations and spatial weights for GIS analysis, with deprecation warnings and environment variable controls.",
  "sources": "GeoDataFrame geometries, environment variables, spatial index queries",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points identified",
  "flows": "Geometry data -> spatial index query -> neighbor list; environment variable -> warning control",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated functions, environment variable for legacy control, warnings for deprecation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard GIS utility for spatial neighbor and weight calculations, with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. It uses environment variables and warnings for legacy support, which are typical and benign. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The spatial index queries and geometry manipulations are routine GIS operations. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard spatial analysis utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
