  "purpose": "Defines constants, enums, version mappings, and imports for coremltools, including optional profiling and native extension loading.",
  "sources": "Internal modules, environment variables, optional native extension 'libcoremlpython'.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable for profiling toggle, optional import wrapped in broad exception.",
  "flows": "Environment variable controls profiling; optional import occurs during module load.",
  "anomalies": "Broad try-except around optional import; no malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup module for the coremltools library, establishing constants, enums, version mappings, and handling optional dependencies and profiling features. The broad exception handling for optional imports is a common pattern in open-source projects to allow optional features without failing the entire module. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious activity is present. The environment variable-based profiling toggle is typical for debugging and performance analysis, not malicious. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code based on external input.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, straightforward setup component for coremltools, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The minimal risk score reflects standard practices in optional dependency handling and configuration.",
