{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, enumerations, and module imports for the coremltools Python package used for handling Apple's Core ML model formats, converting models, and setting configurations related to model specification versions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (_os.environ), imported modules, and the code's own module attributes.",
  "sinks": "Module imports, environment variable access, and potential dynamic behavior via import failures.",
  "flows": "Environment variable ENABLE_PROFILING -> Conditional setting of sys.setprofile; module import attempts -> optional fallback; use of constants and enums in other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The import fallback for libcoremlpython is broad but not inherently malicious; it is a common pattern for optional dependencies. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up constants, enums, and imports for the coremltools package. It includes environment-based profiling setup which is a standard development feature. The fallback import for 'libcoremlpython' is benign, used to handle optional dependencies. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code maintains a straightforward and typical structure for a library setup file, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard library setup module for coremltools. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscated or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
