  "purpose": "The function loads the Boston housing dataset from a specified URL, saving it locally if not already saved, and processes it into a structured format for further analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a URL (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) using requests.get(), and reads/writes a local file (/tmp/bostonHousingData.txt).",
  "sinks": "The data is stored locally and read via pandas without processing untrusted input directly into sensitive operations; no data is sent or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The code fetches data from the URL (source), writes it to a local file, then reads and processes the data into a structured numpy array and pandas DataFrame (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL patterns, or unusual code behavior are present. The URL is publicly known for dataset sharing; no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing standard modules. It checks for the existence of a local dataset file, and if missing, it performs an HTTP GET request to a public URL to retrieve the dataset. The dataset is saved locally to avoid repeated downloads. It then reads the dataset with pandas, processes it with numpy, and returns a dictionary containing data, target, and feature names. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. Usage of requests is straightforward for data download, and no untrusted input from external sources influences critical operations beyond data fetching.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate dataset loader for educational or analytical purposes. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply retrieves and processes a publicly available dataset without any suspicious behavior.",
