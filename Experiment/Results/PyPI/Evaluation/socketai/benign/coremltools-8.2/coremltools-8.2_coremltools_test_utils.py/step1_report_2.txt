{
  "purpose": "Load the Boston housing dataset from a remote URL or local cache for analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston' via the requests.get() call.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the retrieved data to a local file '/tmp/bostonHousingData.txt' and reads from it using pandas.read_csv().",
  "flows": "Data is fetched from the URL, written to a local file, then read into a pandas DataFrame for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The URL used is a public dataset, and the request is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defining a function load_boston(). Inside this function, it checks if the local file exists; if not, it fetches data from a public URL using requests.get(). The data is saved locally, then read into a pandas DataFrame with specific formatting. The data processing appears standard for dataset loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The URL is a known public data source, and the data is handled in a typical manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset loader with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply retrieves and processes a public dataset for further use.",
