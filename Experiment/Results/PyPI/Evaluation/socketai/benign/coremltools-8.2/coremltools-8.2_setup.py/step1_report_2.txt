{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'coremltools' Python package, used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'coremltools/version.py', reads files like 'README.md' and license info, and imports modules for setup.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily interacts with the filesystem and imports modules; no untrusted input handling or data transmission is present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file, uses it to set the package version, and configures package data and dependencies for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Uses standard package setup procedures. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup and package configuration for a Python project, including dynamically importing a version number and setting package metadata. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is identified. No network communication, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. All operations are typical for a setup script, with reliance on local files and standard Python packaging tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies, and no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
