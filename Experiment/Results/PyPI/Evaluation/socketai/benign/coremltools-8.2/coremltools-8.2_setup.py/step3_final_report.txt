{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the coremltools Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local version.py file, reads README.md for description, and specifies package data including shared object (.so) files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; no network activity or code execution beyond static imports.",
  "flows": "Import of version.py (source) to __version__, then setup configuration data (package info, dependencies, data files).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The import of version.py is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: importing version info, reading documentation, and defining package data and dependencies. No network activity, code injection, or external code execution is present. The package data includes precompiled shared libraries, which are typical for extensions. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script for a Python package with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
