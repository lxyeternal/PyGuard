{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the coremltools Python package, primarily to define package metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from coremltools/version.py, importing packages, reading README.md, and specifying package data files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; all data reads are from local files or package metadata.",
  "flows": "Importing version data from local version.py, reading static files for long description, and package installation configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; the script performs standard setup procedures without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Python package setup using setuptools. It dynamically loads the package version from a local file, reads static documentation files, and specifies dependencies and package data. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation. All actions are consistent with standard package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate and safe setup script for coremltools.",
