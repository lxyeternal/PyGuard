{
  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and package the coremltools Python library, including retrieving version info, specifying package data, dependencies, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from a separate version.py file within the coremltools directory, and reads the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input data or lead to data leaks. No network operations, file writing based on external input, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The version.py file is loaded dynamically to assign the __version__ variable; README.md is read for documentation purposes. These are standard package setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of importlib to load version info is standard and safe in this context. The package_data includes shared library files but no suspicious content. No code executes external commands or handles untrusted inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: importing modules, dynamically loading version info, defining package metadata, and including shared libraries and documentation files. All actions are aligned with standard Python packaging practices. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for the coremltools package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only loads internal files and defines package metadata, with no suspicious operations.",
