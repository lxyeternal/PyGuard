{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the coremltools Python package, used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and data files for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version from a local file ('coremltools/version.py'), reading README.md, and defining package data.",
  "targets": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing; no network communication, eval, exec, or system calls.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow leading to malicious actions. The version is imported via a local file; package data and dependencies are specified without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no network activity or system commands. The import of version.py is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static package setup configuration, importing version info from a local file, and defining package metadata, dependencies, and data files. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The only dynamic code execution occurs in importing a local file, which is typical and not malicious. The package data includes shared objects (.so files), but these are likely precompiled libraries. No network activity or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for the coremltools package with no malicious behavior, no malicious payloads, and no security risks detected. It is a typical package configuration file, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
