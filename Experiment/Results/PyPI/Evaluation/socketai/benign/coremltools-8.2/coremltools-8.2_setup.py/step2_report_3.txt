  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, performing typical operations: importing version info from a local file, reading README.md, defining package data, dependencies, and metadata.\n- No report indicates any network activity, dynamic code execution beyond importing a local file, or handling untrusted input.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The only dynamic operation is importing version.py, which is standard practice in Python packaging.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n   - No evidence of malware or malicious payloads in the code.\n   - The package data includes shared object files (.so), which are likely precompiled libraries, not malicious code.\n   - No network activity, external system calls, or code execution that could be malicious.\n\n2. **Code logic and reasoning:**\n   - The logic is straightforward: load version info, set up package metadata, dependencies, and data files.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - The import of version.py is standard and safe.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the script is benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard package setup.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- Given the reports' high confidence and thorough analysis, I concur with their conclusions.\n- The only potential concern could be the shared object files (.so), but without evidence of malicious code within them, they are likely legitimate precompiled libraries.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe setup script is a typical, well-structured Python package configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll assessments are consistent with the evidence.",
