  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same setup script for the `coremltools` Python package.\n- They consistently identify the script as a standard package configuration, with no suspicious behaviors, no code obfuscation, no network activity, and no malicious payloads.\n- The only dynamic operation is importing a local version file, which is standard practice.\n- Package data includes shared object files (.so), which are likely precompiled libraries, not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no network, eval, exec, system calls, or untrusted input handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None apparent; the code is standard and correctly structured.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.5 at most, which is reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is justified. No malicious payloads, no network activity, no suspicious code.\n   \n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`, which is correct. The code is clear and standard.\n   \n3. **Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The only slight concern could be the dynamic import of `version.py`. But this is a common pattern and not malicious.\n   - Package data includes shared libraries (.so files), but these are standard for compiled extensions and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions.** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the consistent and thorough analysis, I see no reason to alter the scores or conclusions. The package appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script for `coremltools` is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores are accurate, and I concur with the reports' assessments.",
