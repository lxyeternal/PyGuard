{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the coremltools Python package, used to package, install dependencies, and provide package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from an external version.py file, reads README.md, and loads package data from filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Reads version from version.py → uses in setup() for versioning; reads README.md and package data → used during installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; standard setup script for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, dynamically loads version info from a local file, and configures package setup with metadata and dependencies. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or dynamic code execution beyond standard package setup. No indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no suspicious behavior or malicious elements. It securely packages the coremltools library with proper metadata and dependencies.",
