  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script, performing package configuration, reading version info from a local file, and specifying package data and dependencies.\n- No network activity, code execution beyond static imports, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only dynamic code execution is importing a local version.py file, which is common practice.\n- Package data includes shared object (.so) files, which are likely precompiled libraries, not malicious payloads.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code does not exhibit any obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- No suspicious code patterns, no external code execution, no network activity.\n- Importing version info from a local file is standard.\n- Package data and dependencies are typical.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe setup script for a Python package.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and align with my analysis. The setup script is a typical, benign package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
