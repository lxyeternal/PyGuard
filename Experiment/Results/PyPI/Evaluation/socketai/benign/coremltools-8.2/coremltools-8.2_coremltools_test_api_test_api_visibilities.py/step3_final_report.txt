  "purpose": "Static verification of coremltools API modules and functions to ensure their visibility and correctness.",
  "sources": "Module attributes accessed via dir() and compared against predefined expected lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code performs static introspection only.",
  "flows": "Listing module attributes (sources) and asserting their match with expected values (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite that inspects module attributes of coremltools to verify API consistency. It uses dir() to list attributes and compares them to expected lists with assertions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code's purpose is API validation, which is benign. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, read-only nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static API validation script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
