{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test and verify the visibility of public APIs within the coremltools Python package, ensuring that expected modules and functions are accessible and correctly exposed.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the coremltools package by listing directory contents using dir() and accessing internal utils such as ct.utils._is_macos().",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions with potential security implications.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve obtaining visible modules via dir(), filtering them, and comparing against expected lists for validation; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code consists solely of tests and API visibility checks. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the coremltools library and defines utility functions to retrieve visible module names. It sets up expected module lists for various parts of the library and defines multiple test methods within a class to verify that the actual visible modules match expectations. The tests conditionally adjust expectations based on OS detection, but do not perform any malicious actions or process untrusted data. No obfuscated code, network activity, or credential handling is detected. The code's structure is consistent with standard testing practices for API exposure and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, standard API visibility test suite for the coremltools package. It checks the accessibility of public modules and functions without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no security concerns or malicious elements present.",
