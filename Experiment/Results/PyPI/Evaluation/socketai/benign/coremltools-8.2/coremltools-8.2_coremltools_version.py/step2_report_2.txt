  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the actual snippet:**  \n   The code is a minimal snippet containing only comments and a single assignment to `__version__`. All reports correctly identify that there's no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The `obfuscated` score is 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely metadata with no executable or data processing components, higher risk scores are unwarranted. The assigned scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. No malicious activity is detected or suggested.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the actual code content, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign, non-obfuscated, with no security risks.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple header with licensing info and version declaration, posing no security threat.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is entirely benign, serving only as metadata. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
