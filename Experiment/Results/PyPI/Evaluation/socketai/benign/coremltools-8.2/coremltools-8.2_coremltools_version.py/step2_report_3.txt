  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single assignment to `__version__`.\n   - No functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic code.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - Based on the code, there are no issues related to security, malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is benign, serving as metadata for versioning and licensing.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious elements.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or malicious logic.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the reports.\n\n4. **Score Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be exploited.\n   - The license comment is standard and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n7. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is just a header snippet, its security implications are minimal.\n   - No obfuscation or malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code snippet is purely boilerplate, containing licensing and version information with no malicious or security-related issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: If I were to assign my own estimates based on the review, I would concur with the existing scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**.",
