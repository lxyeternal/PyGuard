  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and version declaration, likely part of a larger software project or library.",
  "sources": "The only source is the hardcoded string assigning a version number and the license comment at the top.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; there are no operations that handle untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; code only defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The code consists solely of comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a copyright comment, license information, and a version string assignment. There are no functions, inputs, outputs, or executable logic. The license comment is standard boilerplate, and the version string is a static variable. No security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata with no malicious intent or security risks.",
