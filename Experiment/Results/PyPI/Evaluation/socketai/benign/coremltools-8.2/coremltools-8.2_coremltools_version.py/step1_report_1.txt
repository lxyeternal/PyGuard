{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version string and includes licensing information, likely part of a larger software project.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or input/output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments and a simple assignment; no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of licensing comments and a version variable assignment. There are no functions, external input handling, or data processing. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic is present. This appears to be boilerplate licensing and version declaration code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, containing only licensing information and a version identifier. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard header snippet in a larger codebase.",
