  "purpose": "Metadata declaration including licensing and version information for the package.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only comments and a static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows or source-to-sink paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header with licensing comments and a version string assignment. It contains no functions, data processing, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is entirely benign, serving as metadata within a larger codebase. No security concerns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The scores and assessments are accurate and require no modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
