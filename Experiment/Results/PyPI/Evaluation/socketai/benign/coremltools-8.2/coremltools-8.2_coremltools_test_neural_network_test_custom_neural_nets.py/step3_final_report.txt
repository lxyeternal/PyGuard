{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a simple neural network model with coremltools, involving embedding, permute, flatten, and inner product layers, then saves and tests it with random input data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy-generated arrays, specifically 'X' for prediction input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs predictions via coremlmodel.predict(), with no external data transmission or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data generated locally -> model prediction -> output predictions; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test script for creating, saving, and predicting with a CoreML model. It uses standard libraries, generates input data locally, and performs predictions without external communication. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is simple and contained within the local environment. The data types and model layers are standard, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a test setup for model creation and inference. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting its harmless, testing nature.",
