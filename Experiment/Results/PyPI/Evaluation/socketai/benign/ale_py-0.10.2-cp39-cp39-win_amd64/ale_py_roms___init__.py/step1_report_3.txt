{
  "purpose": "This code manages and verifies ROM files by checking their existence, integrity via hash, and providing access to their paths.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'ALE_ROMS_DIR', reads 'md5.json' file for expected hashes, reads ROM binary files from disk.",
  "sinks": "Reading files from disk, computing MD5 hashes, raising exceptions or warnings upon hash mismatch, printing to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or default directory -> checks for directory existence -> file existence and hash verification -> return Path or raise warning/error.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for status updates; reliance on external 'md5.json' file for hash validation; no apparent malicious code, but dependency on external data integrity is noted.",
  "analysis": "The code loads expected hashes from a JSON file, caches them, and verifies the integrity of ROM files by comparing computed MD5 hashes with expected values. It provides functionality to list all ROM IDs and retrieve their paths, considering environment overrides for directories. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors is present. The main concern could be the use of print statements and reliance on external hash data, but these are typical for such utility scripts. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected. The process is straightforward and intended for integrity verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate file existence and integrity checks for ROM files without malicious intent. It could be improved by replacing print statements with proper logging, but there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
