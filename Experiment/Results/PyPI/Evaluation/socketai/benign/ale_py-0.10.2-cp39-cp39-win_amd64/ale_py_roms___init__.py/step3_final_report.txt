{
  "purpose": "The code loads expected MD5 hashes from a JSON file, locates ROM files based on a provided name or environment variable, verifies the file's MD5 hash against the expected value, and returns the path if valid.",
  "sources": "Reads 'md5.json' file for expected hashes; accesses environment variable 'ALE_ROMS_DIR' for ROM directory; reads ROM binary files to compute MD5 hashes.",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations for reading ROM files; hash comparison to validate integrity; warnings and exceptions for invalid or mismatched files.",
  "flows": "Loads expected hashes from JSON -> Checks if ROM file exists in directory -> Reads ROM file content -> Computes MD5 hash -> Compares with expected hash -> Returns path if valid or raises warning/exception.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for logging; reliance on external 'md5.json' and environment variable without validation; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard integrity verification for ROM files by comparing MD5 hashes loaded from a JSON file. It uses environment variables to locate ROM directories, with fallback to script directory. The functions are straightforward, with proper error handling via warnings and exceptions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network activity, code injection, or obfuscation, are present. The reliance on external data and environment variables introduces typical supply chain risks but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's clarity and simplicity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for verifying ROM file integrity, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
