{
  "purpose": "To load and verify ROM binary files against expected MD5 hashes for use in emulation or other applications.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'ALE_ROMS_DIR', file 'md5.json', and user-provided 'name' parameter.",
  "sinks": "Reading files from the filesystem, reading environment variables, and calculating MD5 hashes.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> determines roms directory -> reads ROM file -> computes MD5 hash -> compares to expected hash.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statement for logging; no explicit validation of 'name' parameter beyond file existence. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data from 'md5.json' and environment variables to determine paths. It performs hash verification to ensure ROM integrity, which is standard practice. The file operations are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated behavior. The print statement for logging could be considered verbose but not malicious. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate functionality for verifying ROM files, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard ROM file verifier with hash validation, operating in a safe and expected manner. No malicious behavior detected. The only minor concern is verbose logging, but it does not constitute malicious activity.",
