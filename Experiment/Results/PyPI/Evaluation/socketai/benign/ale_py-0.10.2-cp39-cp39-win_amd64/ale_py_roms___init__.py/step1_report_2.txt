{
  "purpose": "This code manages ROM files, including verifying their integrity via hashes and locating them on the filesystem.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable 'ALE_ROMS_DIR', opens 'md5.json' in the same directory, reads ROM binary files to compute MD5 hashes.",
  "sinks": "Reads files from disk, including ROM binary files; potentially reads environment variables; outputs warnings and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'ALE_ROMS_DIR' -> filesystem paths -> opening and reading ROM binary files for hash verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of warnings instead of exceptions for unsupported ROMs is standard. No obfuscation or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads expected hashes from 'md5.json' and verifies the integrity of ROM files by comparing computed MD5 hashes against expected values. It uses environment variables to determine the ROMs directory, allowing flexible loading. The code raises errors if directories do not exist or if hashes mismatch, and it warns if a requested ROM is unsupported. No suspicious or malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. It performs standard file verification procedures. No obfuscated code or malware-like behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward ROM management utility that verifies ROM integrity and locates ROM files securely. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It performs expected validation steps without malicious intent.",
