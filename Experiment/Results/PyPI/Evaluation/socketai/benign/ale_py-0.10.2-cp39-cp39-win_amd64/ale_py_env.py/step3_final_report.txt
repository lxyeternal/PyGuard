{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) for use with Gymnasium, managing ROM loading, environment states, actions, and observations for Atari games.",
  "sources": "ROM loading via ale_py, environment seed setting, action execution, observation retrieval, and environment state cloning/restoring.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration, network communication, or file modifications; data flows are internal to environment control and observation.",
  "flows": "Input actions are mapped and executed via ale_py, environment states are managed internally, and observations are retrieved for agent use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or covert channels detected; code follows standard patterns for RL environment wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of an Atari environment wrapper using ale_py and gymnasium. It manages seeding, ROM loading, environment configuration, action mapping, and observation collection without external communication or malicious behavior. Minor risk scores (0.1) in some reports reflect the environment's access to media data but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an Atari environment wrapper with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The minimal risk score of 0.1 is appropriate given the environment's features but does not suggest malicious activity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
