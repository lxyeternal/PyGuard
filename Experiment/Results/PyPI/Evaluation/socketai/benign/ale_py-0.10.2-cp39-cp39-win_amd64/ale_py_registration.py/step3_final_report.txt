  "purpose": "Register Atari game environments for gymnasium with various configurations and versions.",
  "sources": "Predefined game lists, configuration objects, external library call to ale_py.roms for ROM IDs, and internal functions for environment setup.",
  "sinks": "gymnasium.register() calls with environment parameters; no external untrusted data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static lists and configuration objects into register() calls, with dynamic kwargs via callables, ultimately registering environment IDs with specified parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected. Use of standard library functions and static data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward environment registration script for Atari games, utilizing predefined lists, configuration objects, and external library calls. No user input, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The dynamic kwargs via callables are a common pattern for flexible configuration. External library calls are standard and trusted. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured environment registration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The low risk score is appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
