{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Pydantic type for validating MongoDB ObjectIds, enabling validation and serialization of ObjectId strings within Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the validate method, which takes a string value representing a MongoDB ObjectId.",
  "sinks": "The validate method calls ObjectId.is_valid() to verify the string and then constructs an ObjectId, which could potentially be used in database operations or serialization.",
  "flows": "Input string is passed to validate -> if valid, converted to ObjectId -> returned for further processing or storage.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard validation without any obfuscated code or suspicious logic. It raises clear exceptions on invalid input. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The only external dependency is 'bson', which is standard for MongoDB interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'ObjectId' from 'bson' for validation and conversion. It handles missing 'bson' gracefully by raising an error instructing the user to install 'pymongo'. The custom class 'MongoObjectId' extends 'str' and provides a Pydantic schema for validation, enforcing the correct length and format. The validate method checks if the input is a valid ObjectId string and converts it. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious activities. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident. Usage of 'bson' is standard in MongoDB-related code, and no malicious logic or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility for MongoDB ObjectIds using Pydantic. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It relies on standard libraries and performs proper validation. No security risks are detected. The overall code appears safe and legitimate.",
