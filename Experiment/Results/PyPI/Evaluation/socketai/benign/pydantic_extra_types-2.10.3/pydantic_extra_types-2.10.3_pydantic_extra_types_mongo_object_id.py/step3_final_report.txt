  "flows": "Input string -> validate() method -> ObjectId.is_valid() check -> ObjectId creation or error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation logic, dependency handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom Pydantic type for MongoDB ObjectId validation, relying on bson.ObjectId for format validation. It checks string length and format, converts valid strings into ObjectId instances, and raises ValueError if invalid. Dependency management is handled with a clear error message. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The validation logic is standard, with no network activity or data exfiltration. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for MongoDB ObjectId validation. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code and poses no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
