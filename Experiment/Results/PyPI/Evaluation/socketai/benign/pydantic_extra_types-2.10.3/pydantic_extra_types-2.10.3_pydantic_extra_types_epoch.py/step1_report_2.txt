{
  "purpose": "Define custom pydantic types for handling Unix timestamps as datetime objects, with support for schema generation and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily schema definitions and conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces two custom classes, Number and Integer, inheriting from a base class, for converting Unix timestamps into datetime objects within pydantic models. The classes implement schema definitions and validation functions that convert epoch seconds into datetime, using a constant EPOCH. The _f methods serialize datetime back into epoch seconds. All functions operate solely on provided data with no external data handling or network activity. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward extension for schema validation and serialization of timestamp data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless extension for handling epoch timestamp fields in pydantic models. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected.",
