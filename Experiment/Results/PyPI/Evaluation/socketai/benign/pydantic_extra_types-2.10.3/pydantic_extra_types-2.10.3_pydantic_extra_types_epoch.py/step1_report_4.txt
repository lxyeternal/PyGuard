  "purpose": "Defines custom pydantic types for parsing UNIX timestamps as datetime objects, supporting float and integer representations.",
  "sources": "Data inputs via pydantic model validation; specifically timestamp fields provided as float or integer UNIX timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that serialize datetime objects to timestamps; no apparent data leaks or insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "Input timestamps → _validate methods → datetime objects → serialization via _f methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code implements standard data parsing and serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom pydantic types for handling epoch timestamps as datetime objects, with validation and serialization logic. It uses standard Python libraries and pydantic's schema mechanisms. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows detected. The functions perform straightforward conversions between UNIX timestamps and datetime objects. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors present. The design appears to be a legitimate extension for handling epoch timestamps in pydantic models.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom pydantic types for epoch timestamp handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign extension to facilitate timestamp parsing and serialization.",
