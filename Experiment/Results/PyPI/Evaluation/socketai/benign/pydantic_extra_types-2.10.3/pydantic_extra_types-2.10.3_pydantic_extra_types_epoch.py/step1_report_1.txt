  "purpose": "Define custom Pydantic data types for parsing Unix timestamps as datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Code reads class definitions, method parameters, and constants; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Serialization functions in _f methods, which convert datetime objects to numeric timestamps.",
  "flows": "Data flows from timestamp input through _validate (converting numeric to datetime) to _f (serializing datetime back to timestamp).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, Number and Integer, both extending a base class _Base, to handle Unix timestamp conversion to datetime objects. The core schema functions specify how these types are serialized/deserialized within Pydantic models. The _validate method converts numeric timestamp inputs into datetime objects using a fixed epoch reference. The _f method serializes datetime objects back into timestamps, with no external data or malicious logic involved. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks; the code simply implements data type conversions with standard library usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom Pydantic types for timestamp handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and purposefully designed for schema validation.",
