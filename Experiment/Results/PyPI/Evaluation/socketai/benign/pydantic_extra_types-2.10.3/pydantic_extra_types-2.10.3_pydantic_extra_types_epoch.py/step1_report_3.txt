  "purpose": "Define custom pydantic types for handling epoch-based datetime serialization and validation.",
  "sources": "Constants, class methods, and imported modules such as datetime and pydantic.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or external data interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Class methods process input values, perform timestamp conversions, and return serialized datetime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, Number and Integer, extending a base class _Base, to handle epoch timestamps as float and integer respectively. It includes methods for generating JSON schemas, core schemas, and validation functions that convert timestamp inputs into datetime objects. The _validate methods add the input seconds to a fixed epoch (1970-01-01 UTC), which is standard. Serializer functions convert datetime objects back to timestamps. No external data access, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as a type definition for pydantic models, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom epoch-based datetime types for pydantic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
