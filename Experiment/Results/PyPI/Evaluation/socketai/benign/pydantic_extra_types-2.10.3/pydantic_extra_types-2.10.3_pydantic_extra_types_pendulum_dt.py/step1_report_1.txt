{
  "purpose": "Define custom Pydantic-compatible data types for Pendulum DateTime, Date, and Duration objects with validation and serialization support.",
  "sources": "Imports Pendulum modules, Pydantic core schema handlers, and the input values in validation methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No direct data leaks or harmful system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are validated and transformed through _validate methods; no data leaks or external network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code detected. Use of dynamic parsing and type checks is standard for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements custom Pydantic types for Pendulum date/time objects with validation and serialization. It includes schema registration, validation logic, and conversion functions. No network operations, file manipulations, or system commands are present. Exception handling is standard for validation errors. The code appears to be focused solely on data validation and conversion, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom data types for Pydantic validation, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It does not perform any network or system operations and adheres to expected validation patterns.",
