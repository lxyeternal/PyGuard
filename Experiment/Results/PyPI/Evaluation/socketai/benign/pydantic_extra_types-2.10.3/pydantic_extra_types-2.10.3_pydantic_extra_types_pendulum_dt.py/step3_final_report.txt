{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Pydantic types for Pendulum DateTime, Date, and Duration objects, enabling validation and serialization within Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Input values to _validate methods, including existing instances, strings, and parsed data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or external effects; validation functions process data internally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through _validate methods, which parse and convert to Pendulum objects, then serialize Duration to ISO8601 strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard parsing and exception handling. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom types for Pendulum DateTime, Date, and Duration, with validation that safely parses input data and converts existing instances. It uses standard library functions and exception handling without external side effects. No network, file, or system commands are present. The validation logic is straightforward, and the serialization functions are standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The use of Pendulum's parse is safe within the context of data validation. Overall, the code is a benign implementation of custom data types for Pydantic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and performs only data validation and serialization for Pendulum date/time objects. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the code's purpose.",
