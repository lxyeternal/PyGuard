{
  "purpose": "Define custom Pydantic-compatible types for Pendulum DateTime, Date, and Duration with validation and serialization support.",
  "sources": "Imports Pendulum classes, functions, and Pydantic core schema modules; reads input values in validation methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows directly to sensitive sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input values are validated and transformed into Pendulum-based objects; no external data is sent or used in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward type definitions and validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom Pydantic types wrapping Pendulum datetime objects with validation logic. It includes validation for date, datetime, and duration types, along with serialization functions. The validation functions process input data, convert strings to date/datetime/duration objects, and raise Pydantic errors if invalid. There are no network calls, file operations, or hidden behaviors. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no malicious patterns are present. The code relies on standard libraries and Pendulum/Pydantic APIs, with clear purpose and no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom data types for use in Pydantic models to handle Pendulum date and duration objects with validation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is a typical implementation for type validation and serialization without any security concerns.",
