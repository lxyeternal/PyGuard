  "purpose": "Define custom Pydantic-compatible types for pendulum Date, DateTime, and Duration objects to enable validation within Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Imports from pendulum, pydantic, and pydantic_core; parsing functions; class methods for validation; conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data in a malicious manner. The code primarily validates and converts data types.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation methods (_validate), which parse and convert data into pendulum types. No data is transmitted externally or sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard parsing and validation methods. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom wrapper classes for pendulum Date, DateTime, and Duration, enabling Pydantic validation. It performs type checks and parsing using pendulum's parse functions. Validation errors raise appropriate Pydantic custom errors. No external data transmission, no network connections, and no code injection points are detected. The code is straightforward and primarily focused on type validation and conversion, with no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom Pydantic types for pendulum date/time objects. It performs data validation and conversion safely without evident malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present.",
