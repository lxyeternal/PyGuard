  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and performs only data validation and serialization for Pendulum date/time objects. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the code's purpose."
