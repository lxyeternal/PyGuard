{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class to parse and validate MAC addresses in various formats, mainly for use with Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the __input_value parameter in the _validate method, which is encoded to bytes for processing.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the return statement in validate_mac_address, which outputs a normalized MAC address string. No external sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (string) is received in _validate, converted to bytes, validated, parsed, and then returned as a normalized MAC address string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code performs standard validation and formatting functions.",
  "analysis": "The class defines methods for validating MAC addresses, converting various formats into a standard colon-separated lowercase format. Validation checks include length, format consistency, and hexadecimal parsing. All operations are contained within the class and do not involve external data sources or network activity. The code uses standard error handling via PydanticCustomError for validation issues, which is typical for Pydantic integrations. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors, are present. The code appears well-structured and solely focused on input validation and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard validation module for MAC addresses with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and formatting safely without external data leaks or suspicious behavior.",
