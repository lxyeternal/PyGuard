{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for parsing and validating MAC addresses in various formats using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "Reads input MAC address string encoded as bytes from the validate_mac_address method, invoked via the __get_pydantic_core_schema__ method during model validation.",
  "sinks": "Returns a normalized MAC address string; no external systems or data leaks are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> decode -> validation checks -> conversion to standardized format -> return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of standard validation logic. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates MAC address strings in various formats, converting them into a standardized colon-separated lowercase hex string. It performs length and format checks, raises custom errors on invalid input, and encodes the validated MAC address back as a string. Usage of pydantic for schema validation is standard. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MAC address validation module, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs input validation and normalization without side effects or external interactions.",
