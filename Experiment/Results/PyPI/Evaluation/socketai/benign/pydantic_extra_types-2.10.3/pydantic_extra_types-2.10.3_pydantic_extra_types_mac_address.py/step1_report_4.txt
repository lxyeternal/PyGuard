{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to parse and validate MAC addresses in different formats, used for data validation within models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the __input_value parameter in _validate, and potentially from encoded byte strings passed to validate_mac_address.",
  "sinks": "Returns validated MAC address strings, raises exceptions on invalid input; no external data sinks or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input bytes -> decode -> validation checks -> return formatted MAC address string if valid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of exceptions for validation is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual control flow. No suspicious external calls or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MAC address validation class that strictly checks input formats, length, and hexadecimal content, raising custom errors on failure. Validation involves decoding bytes, verifying length and format, and converting to a standardized string. The code uses standard Python features, with no network access, external data handling, or code execution mechanisms. The error messages are standard and do not contain suspicious content. Overall, the code functions as a standard data validator without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward MAC address validation module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It focuses solely on validating input format and content, with proper error handling. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
