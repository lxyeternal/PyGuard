{
  "purpose": "Provides validation and parsing for MAC addresses in various formats, ensuring correct formatting and length.",
  "sources": "Input string received in __validate__ method, encoded to bytes, then decoded in validate_mac_address.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; errors are raised via exceptions, no external calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input string -> encoded to bytes -> decoded in validate_mac_address -> validation checks -> return normalized MAC string or raise error.",
  "anomalies": "Length check 'if len(string) < 14' may be insufficient for some formats; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard MAC address validation, checking length, format, and hex content. It raises custom errors on invalid input. No external dependencies or network activity are present. The length check could be refined, but overall logic is sound. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward MAC address validator with no malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate due to minor validation limitations. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, reflecting the code's clarity and safety.",
