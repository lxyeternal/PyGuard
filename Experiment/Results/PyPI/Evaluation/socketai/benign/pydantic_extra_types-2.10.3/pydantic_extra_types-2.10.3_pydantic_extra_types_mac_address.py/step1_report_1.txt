{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for parsing and validating MAC addresses in various formats using Pydantic schema.",
  "sources": "Reads input via the validate_mac_address method which decodes byte strings, and via the _validate method which encodes string input to bytes.",
  "sinks": "The validate_mac_address method decodes bytes and raises errors; no data leaks or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string is converted to bytes, validated, and then returned as a formatted string. No external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code performs straightforward validation without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MAC address class using Pydantic for data validation. It validates MAC address formats, lengths, and characters, raising errors if invalid. No external calls, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are found. The use of exception raising for validation failures is standard. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured MAC address validation module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation strictly and safely. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident.",
