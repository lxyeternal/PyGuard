  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. It contains no input/output, no data flows, and no complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present. The code is standard, safe, and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
