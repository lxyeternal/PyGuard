{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom string type for validating domain names using pydantic.",
  "sources": "The class reads input data through the validate and _validate methods, which process values passed for domain validation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code validates input data but does not perform output or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the validate/_validate methods, which apply regex validation and raise errors if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard validation, uses no hardcoded secrets, and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of str with custom validation to ensure a string is a valid domain name. It employs a regex pattern for validation, raising custom errors via pydantic when the input is invalid. There are no external network calls, file operations, or data leaks. The code relies on standard pydantic mechanisms for schema creation and JSON schema generation. No obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom validated string type for domain names, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
