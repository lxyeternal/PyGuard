  "purpose": "Provides a custom validation class for domain name strings, ensuring correct format and length.",
  "sources": "Input value passed to validate and _validate methods; regex pattern matching the domain format.",
  "sinks": "Raises PydanticCustomError on validation failure; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input value flows into validate, then into _validate; validation passes or errors are raised based on regex and length checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard regex validation and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of str with custom validation for domain names, using a regex pattern to enforce format, length constraints, and type checks. It integrates with pydantic's schema system. No external network, file, or malicious behavior is present. The regex pattern is typical for domain validation, though it may not cover all internationalized domains. No obfuscation or suspicious code is detected. Error handling is internal, raising custom errors for invalid input. The security risk and malware scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a domain string validator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
