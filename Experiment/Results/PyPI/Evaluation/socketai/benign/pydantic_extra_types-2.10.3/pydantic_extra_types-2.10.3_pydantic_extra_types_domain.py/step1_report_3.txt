  "purpose": "Provides a custom string type for validating domain names using pydantic with specific formatting rules.",
  "sources": "Input data is read in the validate and _validate methods from the __input_value parameter.",
  "sinks": "Validation raises custom errors; no sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from validate/_validate methods, through regex validation, to the creation of a DomainStr object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The regex used is standard for domain validation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom string subclass with validation logic for domain names, using regex matching and error raising for invalid inputs. The regex pattern is standard for domain validation. There are no external system calls, network activities, or potentially malicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, implementing common validation logic with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard implementation of domain validation logic with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely performs input validation and error raising for invalid domain formats.",
