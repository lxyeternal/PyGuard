  "purpose": "Provide a custom validated string type for domain names with specific validation rules.",
  "sources": "Input values for validation via the validate method, specifically the __input_value parameter.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but potential issues if validation is bypassed or incorrect, leading to invalid data usage.",
  "flows": "Input value -> validate() method -> _validate() method -> return cls(v) if valid.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a regular expression for domain validation; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of str with custom validation logic to enforce domain name format. Validation checks for string type, length constraints, and regex pattern matching. The regex pattern enforces typical domain name structure. The code uses Pydantic's validation framework properly. No untrusted external data sources, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors are present. It functions solely for validation without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured domain string validator with no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to expected standards and does not perform any harmful actions.",
