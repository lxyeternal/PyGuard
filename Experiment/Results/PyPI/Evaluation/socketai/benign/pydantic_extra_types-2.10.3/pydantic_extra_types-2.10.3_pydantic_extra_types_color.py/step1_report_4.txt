{
  "purpose": "Provides a color parsing and representation utility supporting CSS color formats, named colors, and conversions between color models.",
  "sources": "Input strings for color parsing, tuples/lists for color specification, internal regex patterns for parsing color strings, color name lookups, and environment variables (though none are explicitly used here).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network sockets within this code.",
  "flows": "Input strings or tuples flow into parsing functions, which produce RGBA objects. These objects can output color strings, hex values, or RGB/HSL tuples. No data flows into external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code employs standard color parsing techniques. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code structures are present. No suspicious network or system operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for parsing and representing colors, including support for CSS, SVG, and named colors. It uses regex for string parsing, straightforward data structures, and well-understood color conversion algorithms. No functions perform network operations, file I/O, or system commands. The color lookup dictionaries are static and used solely for color name resolution. The code lacks any code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoor mechanisms. No dynamic execution or obfuscated logic is present. The parsing and conversion processes are standard and safe. Overall, the implementation is a standard, well-structured color utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a color parsing and representation utility. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors. No signs of supply chain attack or sabotage are evident.",
