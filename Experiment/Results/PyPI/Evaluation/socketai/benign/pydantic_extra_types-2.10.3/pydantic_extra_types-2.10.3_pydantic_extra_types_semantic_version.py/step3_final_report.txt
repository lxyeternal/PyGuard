  "purpose": "Defines a pydantic-compatible SemanticVersion class extending semver.Version, with schema validation and regex pattern enforcement for semantic versioning.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to validate or parse methods, especially in __get_pydantic_core_schema__ and validate_from_str.",
  "sinks": "The semver.parse() method called on input data; regex pattern matching for version validation.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow from validation functions into semver.parse() and regex validation, then into schema serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard use of regex and parsing; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of the semver library for pydantic integration, performing version validation via regex and parsing. It handles missing dependencies gracefully and provides schema methods for validation and serialization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The use of semver.parse() on untrusted input is mitigated by prior regex validation. The code is clear, standard, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for semantic version validation within pydantic schemas. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
