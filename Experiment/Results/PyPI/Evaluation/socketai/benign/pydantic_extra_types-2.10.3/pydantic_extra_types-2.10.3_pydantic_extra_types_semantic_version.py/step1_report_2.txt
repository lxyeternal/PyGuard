{
  "purpose": "Define a SemanticVersion class based on the semver library, with Pydantic schema support for validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from string inputs via Pydantic schemas and the parse method of semver.Version.",
  "sinks": "The validate_from_str and __get_pydantic_core_schema__ methods process input data and convert it into version objects or schema patterns.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated against a version pattern, parsed into SemanticVersion instances, and serialized back to strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. It dynamically constructs schemas and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the semver library and raises an error if not installed, which is typical for dependency management. The SemanticVersion class extends semver.Version and provides methods for schema definition and validation, leveraging pydantic's core_schema. Validation occurs via regex pattern matching for version strings, and parsing occurs through semver's parse method. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious data handling are present. The use of pydantic's schema functions is standard for data validation and serialization. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a version class with schema support, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema and version handling utility that integrates semver with pydantic, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
