  "purpose": "Define a SemanticVersion class based on the semver library for use with pydantic schemas, including validation and JSON schema generation.",
  "sources": "Import of 'semver' library, class methods using 'semver.Version', 'core_schema' functions, and string pattern for version validation.",
  "sinks": "Parsing input strings into SemanticVersion, generating JSON schemas for version strings.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> validate_from_str or validate_from_str method -> semver parsing or validation -> output of version object or schema.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard libraries and functions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Exception handling for missing 'semver' module is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends the 'semver' library to integrate with pydantic by defining custom schema methods. It includes schema validation functions, JSON schema generation, and parsing methods, all of which follow standard, safe practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity. The exception handling for missing 'semver' is standard. The version validation pattern aligns with semantic versioning standards and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of a versioning library for data validation and schema generation, using standard, well-understood patterns. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
