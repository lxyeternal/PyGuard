{
  "purpose": "The code provides a data type for payment card numbers with validation, brand detection, and masking functionalities.",
  "sources": "The input string 'card_number' provided during instantiation and validation.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data externally or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Input string -> digit validation -> Luhn checksum -> brand detection -> assignment of bin, last4, brand -> masked output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard algorithms. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code validates payment card numbers through digit checks, Luhn algorithm, and BIN-based brand detection. It raises custom errors on invalid data and provides masking functionality. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The validation logic aligns with industry standards, and the code structure is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of payment card validation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with a negligible security risk score (around 0.1) due to handling sensitive data but no actual vulnerabilities.",
