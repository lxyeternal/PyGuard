{
  "purpose": "This module provides a data type for handling and validating payment card numbers, including brand detection and checksum validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the constructor `__init__` method of `PaymentCardNumber`, and the `validate` class method, which process input strings representing card numbers.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `validate_digits`, `validate_luhn_check_digit`, and `validate_brand` methods, which process and validate the input card number. No direct data leaks or external network actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the constructor or `validate` method into validation functions: `validate_digits` for digit check, `validate_luhn_check_digit` for checksum, and `validate_brand` for brand detection. These functions only perform validation and assignment; no external or untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. The code adheres to standard validation procedures for payment card data. No suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for payment card numbers with validation methods for digit-only input, Luhn checksum, and brand detection based on IIN ranges. Validation errors raise `PydanticCustomError`. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard, secure validation logic without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard validation for payment card data, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. The code is well-structured, performs appropriate checks, and does not contain suspicious or malicious code.",
