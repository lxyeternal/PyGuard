  "purpose": "Define and validate a PaymentCardNumber data type with associated brand identification and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Input string for the PaymentCardNumber constructor and validate methods.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly outputs or transmits data externally. No network or file I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> validation functions -> object attributes (bin, last4, brand) and masked property.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code performs standard validation and formatting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a PaymentCardNumber class with validation using Luhn algorithm, length checks, and brand identification based on IIN/BIN. It uses standard Python and pydantic features for schema validation. There are no network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. Validation functions and properties are straightforward and consistent with common payment processing practices. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. The code relies on standard validation algorithms and clearly defined validation rules for payment card numbers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for validating and representing payment card numbers with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It strictly performs validation, formatting, and schema definition tasks. There are no indicators of malware or security risks in the provided code.",
