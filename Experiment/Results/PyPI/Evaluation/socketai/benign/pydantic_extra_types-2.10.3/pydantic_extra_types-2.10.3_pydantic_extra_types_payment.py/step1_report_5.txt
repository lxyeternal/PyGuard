{
  "purpose": "This module provides a data type for validating and handling payment card numbers, including brand detection and Luhn algorithm validation, for use within Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the __init__ method of PaymentCardNumber, specifically the card_number string passed during instantiation. Also, the __get_pydantic_core_schema__ method processes input during validation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write or send data anywhere; it primarily validates data and creates attributes. No external sinks like network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input string from user input or external source -> validate_digits and validate_luhn_check_digit functions -> setting bin, last4, brand attributes -> usage of masked property for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as network calls, file operations, or environment variable access, are present. The code performs standard validation logic for payment card numbers. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and methods to validate credit card numbers according to industry standards. Validation includes digit-only check, Luhn algorithm check, and brand identification based on BIN ranges. No external system access, network operations, or malicious behavior is detected. The validation process appears standard and well-contained. The use of Pydantic custom errors and schema integration suggests intended use in data validation workflows. There are no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, industry-standard implementation of payment card number validation with no malicious behavior. It functions as a utility for validating and masking credit card details within Pydantic data models. No malicious activity, backdoors, or harmful code are present.",
