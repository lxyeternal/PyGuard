{
  "purpose": "Define and validate payment card number data type with brand identification, including checksum validation and masking functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the constructor (__init__) when creating a PaymentCardNumber instance. No explicit external input functions are present; validation occurs on instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions raise PydanticCustomError for invalid data; no external data sinks are present. No data is sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input string passes through validate_digits -> validate_luhn_check_digit -> validate_brand methods during instantiation. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code strictly performs validation and masking functions. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for representing and validating payment card numbers with length checks, Luhn algorithm validation, and brand identification based on IIN ranges. Validation errors raise custom exceptions. The code uses standard algorithms and conventions for payment card validation without any suspicious behavior. No external network communication, data leakage, or covert operations are present. The logic and structure are typical for such validation modules.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs standard, legitimate validation of payment card numbers. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a safe, well-structured component for use in payment systems.",
