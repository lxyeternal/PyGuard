  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- They note that the script reads version info from a local file, loads documentation files, and calls `setuptools.setup()` with static metadata.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets (beyond package metadata), obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The version extraction uses regex, which is a common practice and considered safe here.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0, except report 5, which assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, likely reflecting the minimal risk associated with regex-based version extraction.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code. It performs typical package setup tasks.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or mistakes are evident. The code follows standard practices.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n  - **Risk:** 0 or very close to it; report 5 assigns 0.1, which is acceptable given the regex use but still minimal.\n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0 or very low; the only mention is the regex, which is safe here.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The regex used for version extraction is standard and safe, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No external inputs or untrusted data are processed.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data.\n- The package metadata is static and predefined.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to the regex version extraction, but very minimal and not concerning)  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1 (again, due to regex, but standard and safe in this context)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided setup script is a typical, benign Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score assigned in report 5 is reasonable, but overall, the code remains very safe.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the regex usage, but it’s negligible)  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (same reasoning)\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and standard.",
