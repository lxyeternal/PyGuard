{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, environment variables are not used, no external input apart from local files.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions that process untrusted data; the script mainly reads static files and writes package metadata.",
  "flows": "File reading sources (version, readme, changelog) to setup parameters; no external or untrusted data flow to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The version extraction uses regex but is standard practice; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for version and documentation info, then calls setup() with package metadata. It relies on local files and standard setup tools, with no network connections, code injection, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. Overall, the code performs a typical package setup routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or suspicious operations.",
