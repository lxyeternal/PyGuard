  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '_version.py', reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no user input or external data sources are utilized in a way that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> loads package metadata -> prepares package setup configuration -> installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; standard setup.py pattern; no hardcoded secrets, code injection, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines: reading version info, reading documentation files, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code adheres to common Python packaging practices and does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py file used for Python package distribution with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
