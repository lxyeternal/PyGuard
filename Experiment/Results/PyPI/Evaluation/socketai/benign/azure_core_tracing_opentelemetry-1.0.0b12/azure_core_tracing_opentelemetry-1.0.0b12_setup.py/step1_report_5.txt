  "purpose": "Set up configuration and metadata for packaging the 'azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry' Python library.",
  "sources": "File reads for '_version.py', 'README.md', and 'CHANGELOG.md'. Hardcoded package information such as name, description, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data or external inputs are processed or used in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (version, README, changelog) into the setup configuration without transformation, and static strings are used for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets (beyond metadata), no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The version extraction uses regex but appears safe and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads version info from a file and metadata from markdown files, then invokes setuptools.setup() with static and read data. No untrusted inputs or suspicious code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
