  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry with Azure EventHub SDK for tracing and exporting telemetry data.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables 'EVENT_HUB_HOSTNAME', 'EVENT_HUB_NAME', 'EVENTHUB_CONN_STR' for connection parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses the environment variable 'EVENTHUB_CONN_STR' to establish a connection to EventHub; prints event data upon receipt.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Connection string and namespace → EventHub client creation → Sending event data → Tracing spans exported to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present. Exporter is set to console only, no network calls observed outside standard telemetry export.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up OpenTelemetry tracing with a console exporter, then creates an EventHub producer client using credentials and namespace from environment variables. It sends a batch with a single message within a traced span. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard practice. No suspicious data flows or anomalous code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate example of integrating OpenTelemetry tracing with Azure EventHub SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
