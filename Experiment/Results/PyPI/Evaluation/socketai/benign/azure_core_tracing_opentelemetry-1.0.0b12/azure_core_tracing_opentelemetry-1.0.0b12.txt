No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The use of environment variables is typical, with a minor security consideration for secret management. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The minimal security risk is justified by proper use of environment variables, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to potential data exposure in trace attributes. Overall, it poses no supply chain security threat and is safe for use in testing environments."
