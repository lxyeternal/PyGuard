  "purpose": "Demonstrates Azure EventHub SDK usage with OpenTelemetry tracing, including setup and callbacks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and connection info; imported libraries; commented-out exporter code.",
  "sinks": "Console output for trace spans and event processing; no data leaks or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> SDK setup -> tracing span -> event callbacks -> console output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out Azure Monitor exporter with placeholder connection string; no secrets hardcoded; straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign example of integrating Azure EventHub with OpenTelemetry. Credentials are sourced securely from environment variables. The commented exporter code is inactive and contains no secrets. Callback functions perform simple print statements. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The only minor concern is the commented exporter code, which could be misused if activated with sensitive data, but in current state, it poses minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard telemetry and event processing example with no malicious intent. The presence of inactive, commented exporter code does not introduce security issues but warrants caution if activated. Overall, the code's security risk is very low, and malware likelihood is zero.",
