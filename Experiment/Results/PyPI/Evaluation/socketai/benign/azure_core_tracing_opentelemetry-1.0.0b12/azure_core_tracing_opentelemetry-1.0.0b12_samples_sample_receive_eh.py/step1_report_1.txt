  "purpose": "This code demonstrates usage of the azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry with EventHub SDK to trace and monitor event processing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'EVENT_HUB_HOSTNAME', 'EVENT_HUB_NAME', 'EVENTHUB_CONN_STR'; External libraries: azure, opentelemetry",
  "sinks": "Printing to console in callback functions; no data sinks are explicitly writing to external locations or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Credential and namespace variables -> Tracer setup -> EventHub consumer callbacks -> Console printing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; commented-out sections referencing Azure Monitor exporter do not contain sensitive data; all environment variables are read dynamically",
  "analysis": "The code sets up OpenTelemetry tracing with ConsoleSpanExporter, configures EventHub consumer callbacks, and reads sensitive credentials from environment variables rather than hardcoded secrets. No suspicious or malicious code is present. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behavior detected. The code performs standard tracing and event consumption functions with no unusual logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate example demonstrating Azure EventHub tracing integration with OpenTelemetry. It reads credentials securely from environment variables and outputs trace data to the console. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
