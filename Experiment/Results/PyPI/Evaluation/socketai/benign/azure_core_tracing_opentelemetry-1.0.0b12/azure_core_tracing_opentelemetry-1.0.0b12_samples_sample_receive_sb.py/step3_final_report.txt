  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry with Service Bus SDK, including telemetry export setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables SERVICE_BUS_CONN_STR and SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE_NAME, and code import statements.",
  "sinks": "Console output of received messages; optional telemetry export to Azure Monitor (commented).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> ServiceBusClient connection -> message send/receive -> telemetry span creation and export.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets; commented Azure Monitor exporter with placeholder connection string.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up OpenTelemetry tracing with a console exporter, connects to Azure Service Bus using environment variables, sends a message, and receives messages within a tracing span. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of environment variables for secrets is standard. The telemetry export is benign. No code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code and reliance on environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign example of telemetry integration with Azure Service Bus. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The existing scores are justified and accurate.",
