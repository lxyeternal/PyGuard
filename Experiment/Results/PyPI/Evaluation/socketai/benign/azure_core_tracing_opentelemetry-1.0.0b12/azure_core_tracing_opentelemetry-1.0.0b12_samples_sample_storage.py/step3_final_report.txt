{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of Azure SDK with OpenTelemetry tracing, exporting traces to console or Azure Monitor.",
  "sources": "Environment variables AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING and AZURE_STORAGE_BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME, imported modules (azure.core.settings, azure.storage.blob, os, opentelemetry).",
  "sinks": "The creation of a storage container within a traced span; no untrusted data flows to external sinks or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to initialize connection; traced span encompasses container creation; no external data flows beyond standard SDK operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with commented-out code for optional Azure Monitor exporter containing placeholder connection string.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up OpenTelemetry tracing with a console exporter, reads sensitive configuration from environment variables, and creates a storage container within a traced span. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of environment variables for secrets is standard practice, and the code does not perform any suspicious actions. The commented Azure Monitor exporter with placeholder connection string is benign and typical for sample code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk due to environment variable handling. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-0.95).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured example demonstrating telemetry integration with Azure SDKs. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The minimal security risk is justified by proper use of environment variables, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
