  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured example demonstrating telemetry integration with Azure SDKs. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The minimal security risk is justified by proper use of environment variables, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation."
