{
  "purpose": "Display system uptime information, either in human-readable format or boot time, based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and calls external functions 'uptime()' and 'boottime()' from the 'uptime' module.",
  "sinks": "Outputs uptime information to stdout or error messages to stderr; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input: sys.argv for command options, and function calls 'uptime()' and 'boottime()'; Output: formatted uptime or boot time string to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The import of 'uptime' appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and 'uptime' for retrieving system uptime and boot time. It processes command-line arguments to determine output format. The 'uptime()' function provides the system uptime in seconds; the code converts this into days, hours, minutes, and seconds for display. The 'boottime()' function provides the boot timestamp, formatted with strftime. The code includes locale setting, which is harmless. No external data sources are used, and no untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The logic is simple, transparent, and uses standard practices for system information display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to display system uptime or boot time, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely performs system info retrieval and display.",
