  "purpose": "The script calculates and displays system uptime or boot time.",
  "sources": "Importing modules (sys, time, uptime, locale); calling uptime() and boottime() functions",
  "sinks": "Outputting to stdout or stderr; calling boottime().strftime() for display",
  "flows": "uptime() provides uptime data -> formatted and printed to stdout; boottime().strftime() provides boot time -> printed to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of standard modules and functions. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and uses the 'uptime' library to fetch system uptime. It handles locale settings with exception suppression. It formats and displays uptime or boot time based on command-line arguments. No external data is fetched, no network activity, and no hidden behaviors are present. All functions used are standard or legitimate for such a utility. The code appears straightforward and intended for system monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate system utility to display uptime or boot time without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
