  "conclusion": "The script is a benign system utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The external 'uptime' functions are assumed safe. The code is clear, straightforward, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
