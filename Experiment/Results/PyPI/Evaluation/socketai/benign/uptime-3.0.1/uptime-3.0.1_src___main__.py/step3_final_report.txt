{
  "purpose": "Display system uptime or boot time using external 'uptime' and 'boottime' functions, formatted for user readability.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments ('-b'), calls 'uptime()' and 'boottime()' functions from external library, and reads system locale settings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted uptime or boot time to stdout or stderr; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Command-line args ('-b') influence output path; 'uptime()' and 'boottime()' provide data for display; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward system utility that retrieves and displays system uptime or boot time. It uses standard modules and an external 'uptime' library, assuming benign behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code handles exceptions gracefully and formats output clearly. External dependencies are assumed trustworthy; no obfuscation or hardcoded credentials are present. The logic is simple and transparent, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign system utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The external 'uptime' functions are assumed safe. The code is clear, straightforward, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
