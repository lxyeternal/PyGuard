{
  "purpose": "This script retrieves and displays the system's uptime or boot time.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time and uptime information via the 'uptime()' function and potentially the 'boottime()' function.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output and standard error streams; no untrusted data handling or external network communication is present.",
  "flows": "Input system data via 'uptime()' and 'boottime()' functions -> formats data -> outputs to stdout/stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs straightforward uptime reporting. The import of 'locale' appears to be for formatting purposes, and the code handles exceptions gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'uptime' module functions, calls 'uptime()' to obtain system uptime, and optionally calls 'boottime()' for boot timestamp. It formats the uptime into days, hours, minutes, and seconds, or prints the boot time if '-b' flag is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external network activity. The code operates purely locally, with no data exfiltration, command injection, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard system uptime reporting script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and straightforward.",
