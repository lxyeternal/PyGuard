{
  "purpose": "The script retrieves and displays system uptime or boot time information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), system uptime via 'uptime()' and 'boottime()' functions, and locale settings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs uptime information to stdout or stderr based on user input.",
  "flows": "Reads user input (command-line args) -> retrieves system uptime/boot time -> formats and outputs data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of external functions 'uptime()' and 'boottime()' could be examined if they contain malicious code, but assuming they are standard or benign.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the system uptime using the 'uptime()' function from the imported module. It formats the uptime into days, hours, minutes, and seconds unless '-b' is specified, in which case it displays boot time using 'boottime()'. No untrusted data sources are used beyond command-line arguments, and outputs are straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. External functions 'uptime()' and 'boottime()' are assumed to be standard or benign, as they are imported from a package named 'uptime'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for displaying system uptime or boot time information. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are apparent based on the provided code.",
