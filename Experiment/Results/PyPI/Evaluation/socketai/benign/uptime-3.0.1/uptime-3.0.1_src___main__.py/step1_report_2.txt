{
  "purpose": "The script retrieves and displays system uptime information, either in a human-readable format or as a boot time, based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), system uptime via uptime() function, and boot time via boottime() function.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout or stderr using sys.stdout.write and sys.stderr.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '-b' influences the output format; uptime() provides system uptime data, which is formatted and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Uses standard library functions and an external 'uptime' module without malicious activity. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing standard modules and an external 'uptime' module. It sets locale settings with exception handling, which is common. It retrieves uptime data; if unavailable, it writes an error message. Depending on the presence of '-b' argument, it either formats and outputs the uptime in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, or displays the boot time using boottime(). There are no evident malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The functions used are standard for system info retrieval, and outputs are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for displaying system uptime or boot time. It employs standard libraries and practices without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks identified.",
