      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a Python package with optional C extension compilation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor risk score reflects the broad exception handling that could obscure build errors but does not imply malicious activity."

The code is clear, straightforward, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
