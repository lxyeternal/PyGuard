  "purpose": "Provides cross-platform functions to determine system uptime and boot time.",
  "sources": "Reads system files such as /proc/uptime, /proc/stat, /dev/time, and interacts with OS-specific libraries via ctypes (e.g., libc, libkstat.so, swi). Uses os.stat and sys.platform for environment detection.",
  "sinks": "Calls into native libraries via ctypes, potentially passing untrusted data to system calls or kernel interfaces. Uses sysctlbyname and kstat APIs which can be sensitive. No apparent untrusted data inputs are processed into vulnerable outputs, but external library calls could be exploited if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Reads system data from files and system calls (sources) and processes or returns uptime/boot time (sinks). The functions gather system info and convert it into timestamps or durations, with flow paths including reading files and calling system libraries.",
  "anomalies": "Contains multiple platform-specific implementations with extensive ctypes usage; some fallback mechanisms could be suspicious but appear to be standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. Use of dynamic library loading and system calls is extensive but consistent with system info retrieval. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to retrieve system uptime and boot time across various operating systems using standard system interfaces and files. It uses multiple platform detection mechanisms and fallback options. Extensive use of ctypes to call native libraries could be exploited if libraries are compromised, but this appears standard for such system info retrieval. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are evident. The code avoids suspicious obfuscation and does not execute untrusted code or network communications. Overall, it performs legitimate system introspection functions with typical system calls and file reads. No malicious intent or malware signs are present; the code relies on system-provided data and libraries. The potential risk is minimal, mostly related to the inherent risk of ctypes calls if the underlying system libraries are malicious or compromised, but this is a common and accepted approach for system info gathering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a multi-platform system uptime and boot time utility that uses standard system files and libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling were found. The extensive use of ctypes for system library interaction is typical for such functions and does not indicate malicious intent. The risk level is low, with no evidence of malware or malicious sabotage.",
