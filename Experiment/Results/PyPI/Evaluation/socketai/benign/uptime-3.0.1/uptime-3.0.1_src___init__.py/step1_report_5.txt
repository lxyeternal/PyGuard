{
  "purpose": "Provides cross-platform methods to determine system uptime and boot time, mainly for informational purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from system files like /proc/uptime, /proc/stat, /dev/time; uses ctypes to load system libraries; calls system-specific APIs for uptime and boot time.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks for untrusted data; no network transmission or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads system data from files or system libraries; processes data to calculate uptime or boot time; returns values or raises errors based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple platform-specific code paths; attempts to load system libraries via ctypes without verification; global variables (__boottime) are manipulated; some fallback mechanisms are broad and may misfire; no explicit hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code appears to be designed solely for system info retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads system uptime and boot time information from various OS-specific sources, such as /proc files, system libraries, and APIs. It uses ctypes for cross-platform compatibility and handles several different operating systems. There are no network communications, no suspicious data handling, or code that could be used for malicious purposes. The functions are focused on system data retrieval without any evident malicious behavior or sabotage. The code structure suggests it is a utility module for system info rather than an attack vector. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate system information utility designed for cross-platform uptime and boot time retrieval. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It primarily interacts with system files and APIs for informational purposes without any malicious intent or harmful side effects.",
