{
  "purpose": "Provides a cross-platform utility to determine system uptime and boot time using system files, APIs, and platform-specific methods.",
  "sources": "Reads system files (/proc/uptime, /proc/stat, /dev/time), calls system libraries via ctypes, and uses platform-specific modules and APIs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, no network activity, no data exfiltration or malicious output detected.",
  "flows": "Reads system info from files or system calls; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive platform-specific code, ctypes usage for system calls, but all standard for system info utilities; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard techniques for retrieving system uptime across multiple platforms, using system files, ctypes calls, and platform APIs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The ctypes usage is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. Exception handling is broad but appropriate. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are found. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, multi-platform system uptime utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate given its standard system interactions. All reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.",
