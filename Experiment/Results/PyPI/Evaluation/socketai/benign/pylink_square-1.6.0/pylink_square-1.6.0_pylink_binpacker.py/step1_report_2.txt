  "purpose": "Utility functions for calculating the size and packing of integer values into byte arrays.",
  "sources": "Function arguments 'value' and 'nbits' in 'pack_size' and 'pack'. No external data inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; functions return packed byte arrays or size calculations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'value' and 'nbits' flow through calculations to generate byte arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. Usage of 'ctypes' is for packing data, which is standard in low-level operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for calculating the minimal byte size needed for an integer and packing integers into byte arrays. The use of 'ctypes' for packing data is standard practice. No input/output data is read from or written to external sources, and there are no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The functions perform mathematical operations and data packing in a straightforward manner without side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for integer size calculation and packing, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
