  "purpose": "Utility functions to compute the minimal byte size of an integer and to pack an integer into an array of bytes, mainly for data serialization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'value' and 'nbits' in functions 'pack_size' and 'pack'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows into 'pack_size' and 'pack'; 'pack' computes and packs 'value' into a byte array based on 'nbits'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of 'ctypes' to create byte buffers is standard for serialization tasks; no evidence of obfuscation or malicious code. No unsafe input handling or suspicious data flow observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to determine the number of bytes needed to store a non-negative integer and to pack this integer into a byte array in little-endian order. It performs input validation, such as checking for non-negative values and positive bit lengths, but there are no external data sources, network operations, or side effects. The use of 'ctypes' for buffer creation is typical in low-level data serialization. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard utility module for packing integers into byte arrays.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for data packing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper input validation and no suspicious activity detected.",
