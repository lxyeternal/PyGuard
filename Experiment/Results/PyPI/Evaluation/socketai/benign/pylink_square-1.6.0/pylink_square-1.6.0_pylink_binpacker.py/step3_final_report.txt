  "purpose": "Utility functions for calculating the minimal byte size of integers and packing integers into little-endian byte arrays.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'value' and 'nbits' in 'pack_size()' and 'pack()' respectively.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform internal calculations and memory packing without external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into validation and calculation steps, resulting in byte array output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with proper validation and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions: 'pack_size()' calculates the minimal number of bytes needed to represent a non-negative integer, raising errors for invalid input. 'pack()' serializes an integer into a little-endian byte array, optionally specifying the number of bits, with input validation and correct handling of edge cases. The use of 'ctypes' for buffer creation is standard. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions are deterministic, safe, and do not perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data serialization with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and suitable for inclusion in larger projects without security concerns.",
