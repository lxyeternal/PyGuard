{
  "purpose": "A custom threading class that extends threading.Thread to allow retrieving the return value of the target function after thread execution.",
  "sources": "The target function specified in the thread, accessed via getattr on internal attributes; args and kwargs for the target function.",
  "sinks": "The return value of the target function stored in self._return and retrieved via join(). No external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The target function is called with args and kwargs; its return value is stored in self._return; join() returns this value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal/private attributes (_Thread__target, _target, etc.) for accessing target and args, but this is a known pattern for such utility classes; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of threading.Thread to support returning a value from the thread. It uses standard practices, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of getattr to access private attributes is typical for this pattern. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the implementation is clear and safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility class for threading with return value support. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
