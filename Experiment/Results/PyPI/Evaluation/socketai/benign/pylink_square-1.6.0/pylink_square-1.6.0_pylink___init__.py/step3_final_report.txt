{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the package's metadata and initialization, importing internal modules necessary for the SDK's functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables and imports internal modules such as enums, errors, jlink, library, structs, and unlockers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization file containing metadata and import statements. It does not process external data, perform network communication, or execute logic that could be malicious. The import statements are internal and do not involve dynamic or suspicious behavior. The license headers and metadata are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup file with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. All signals and reports align with this assessment, and the scores should reflect a safe status.",
