  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import core components for a Python interface to SEGGER J-Link SDK.",
  "sources": "Module metadata (author, license, version, description, URL). Import statements for internal modules (.enums, .errors, .jlink, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network calls or data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only sets metadata and imports internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple import statements from local modules, but no suspicious or unusual code structures or patterns. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains module metadata (author, version, license, URL, description) and import statements for internal modules. There is no execution logic, data handling, or external communication in this snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, used to set up package metadata and imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious content. It only defines metadata and imports local modules related to a J-Link SDK interface. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
