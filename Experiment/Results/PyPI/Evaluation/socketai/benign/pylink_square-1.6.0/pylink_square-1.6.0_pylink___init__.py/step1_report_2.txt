  "purpose": "Provide a Python interface for SEGGER J-Link hardware, enabling interaction with the J-Link SDK via DLL.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: enums, errors, jlink, library, structs, unlockers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily imports modules and sets metadata.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows or untrusted data handling observed in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The file contains only metadata, license info, and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing information, package metadata, and module imports. It does not process input, handle data, or perform any logic. No suspicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a straightforward package initialization file with no malicious or security-threatening code. It solely provides package metadata and imports necessary components for the J-Link interface.",
