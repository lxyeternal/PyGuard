  "purpose": "Static definitions of error codes, constants, enumerations, and function prototypes for the SEGGER J-Link SDK, used in embedded debugging and device control.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes, error code mappings, and ctypes function prototypes; no dynamic input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions with no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely static mappings and interface declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enumerations, constants, and function prototypes related to the J-Link SDK. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or execute logic that could be malicious. The structure is consistent with standard SDK interface definitions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. Error-to-string functions are straightforward mappings, and no external data handling or dynamic code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface definition for embedded debugging tools. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It poses no supply chain security threat or malicious risk.",
