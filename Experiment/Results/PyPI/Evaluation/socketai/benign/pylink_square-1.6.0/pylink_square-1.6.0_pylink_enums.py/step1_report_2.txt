{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations, constants, and function prototypes for the J-Link SDK API, facilitating debugging, flashing, tracing, and other target device operations.",
  "sources": "Import of 'ctypes' for C function interfacing; class attributes and methods providing static data and error code mappings.",
  "sinks": "None of the code reads untrusted input or handles data from external sources. No data sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The code mainly establishes static mappings and class structures; there are no dynamic data flows or input-to-output pipelines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. The code purely defines static constants, error mappings, and API prototypes.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a static library of constants, enumerations, and function prototypes related to the J-Link SDK. It uses ctypes for function prototypes, but these are standard for interfacing with C libraries. No dynamic execution, input handling, or data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or sabotage are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward SDK wrapper and enum definition file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK interface definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains static constants and error mappings for device and SDK operations. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
