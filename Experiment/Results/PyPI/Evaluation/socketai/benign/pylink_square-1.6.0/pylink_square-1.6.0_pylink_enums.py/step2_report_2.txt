  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a collection of static constants, enumerations, and function prototypes related to the SEGGER J-Link SDK.\n- No reports mention any dynamic data handling, input parsing, external communication, or runtime logic.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard SDK interface definition, primarily used for embedded debugging and device control.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating that the reviewers are quite certain about the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n\n- The code does **not** contain any embedded logic that manipulates data, executes system commands, or interacts with external sources.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage.\n- The static nature and purpose of the code as an SDK interface strongly suggest it is safe.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The error code to string functions are straightforward mappings.\n- The code's structure is consistent and typical for SDK interface definitions.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- Malware score: all reports are 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- Obfuscated score: all 0, consistent with the static, clear structure.\n- Risk score: all reports are 0 or very close, indicating no significant security risk.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\nGiven the detailed static analysis, the absence of dynamic or suspicious code, and the purpose of this code as an SDK interface, I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, static, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:**\n\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK interface definition for embedded debugging tools. It does not pose any supply chain security threat or malicious risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Risk           | 0               |\n\nAll evidence supports that this code is safe and legitimate.",
