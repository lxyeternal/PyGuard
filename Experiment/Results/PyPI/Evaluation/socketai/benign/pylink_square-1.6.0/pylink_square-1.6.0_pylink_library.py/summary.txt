  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured cross-platform DLL loader for the SEGGER J-Link SDK. It employs standard techniques, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minor risks are related to environment security, not the code itself. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0; the risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical DLL hijacking concerns without malicious activity."
