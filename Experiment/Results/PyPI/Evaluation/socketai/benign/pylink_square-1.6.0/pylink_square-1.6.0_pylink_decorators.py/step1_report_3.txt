{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to execute functions asynchronously using threading, with optional callback handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the function arguments, especially 'callback' in kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The callback function provided by the user could be invoked with exception and result, potentially untrusted if user-defined.",
  "flows": "The decorator intercepts function calls, checks for 'callback', executes the original function in a thread, and then invokes the callback with exception and result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious obfuscation or unusual language features. Uses threading and callback patterns typical for asynchronous execution.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements an asynchronous decorator with proper handling of the 'callback' parameter. It validates that 'callback' is callable before invoking. No suspicious data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The threading implementation appears standard and safe. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an asynchronous function decorator using threading, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured.",
