{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to J-Link hardware operations, providing structured error reporting and inheritance from specific error enums.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from error codes passed to the exception constructors, specifically the 'code' parameter, and relies on external modules 'enums' and 'util' for error enums and type checking.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data beyond error codes; there are no sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or code execution points that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Error codes are received as input, checked if they are integers via 'util.is_integer()', then converted to string messages with 'self.to_string()' if applicable, and then passed to the superclass constructor; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The 'self.to_string()' method is invoked but not defined here; assuming it exists and is safe. The code is straightforward and standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a hardware SDK, with clear handling of error codes and inheritance from enums. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The use of 'util.is_integer()' and 'self.to_string()' is typical, and the overall structure is transparent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional, safe implementation of exception classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate and align with the code's straightforward nature.",
