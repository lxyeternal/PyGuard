  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for J-Link debugging interface, with error code handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through the 'code' parameter in the JLinkException constructor.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; exception raising is standard.",
  "flows": "Input 'code' flows from instantiation into error message and optional code attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of external modules appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from various error enums and Python's Exception class. The constructor processes an input 'code' which may be a number or message, converting numerical codes to strings via 'util.is_integer' and 'self.to_string'. All usage appears standard for error handling. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious logic are present. The code structure is straightforward, with clear inheritance and exception chaining. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be standard error class definitions for a hardware debugging SDK.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as part of a larger library for handling J-Link errors.",
