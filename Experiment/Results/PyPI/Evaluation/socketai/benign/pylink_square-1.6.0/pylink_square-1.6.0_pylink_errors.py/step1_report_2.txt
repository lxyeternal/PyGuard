{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling J-Link related errors and exceptions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines classes and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output; primarily class definitions and error handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; error codes are processed internally for exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from various enums and a base Exception. The primary function is to interpret error codes via util.is_integer() and convert them to strings if applicable. There is no network activity, data leakage, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present. The structure and logic are standard for error handling in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is a typical error handling pattern in Python libraries, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
