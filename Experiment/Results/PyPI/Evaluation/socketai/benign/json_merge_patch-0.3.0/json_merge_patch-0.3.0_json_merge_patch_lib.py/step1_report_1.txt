{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for merging dictionaries with order preservation options and creating a patch (difference) between two dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are dictionaries passed to functions such as create_patch and merge.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to potential data leaks or harmful actions are present; the code manipulates data structures internally without external side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through merge or create_patch functions, resulting in modified or diffed dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The code employs standard library functions and no obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code handles dictionary merging and diff creation, with optional order preservation via 'position'. It correctly manages nested dictionaries and uses standard methods. No suspicious data handling, network operations, or side effects are observed. Functions operate solely on provided data, with no external interactions or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for dictionary operations without malicious intent or security risks. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
