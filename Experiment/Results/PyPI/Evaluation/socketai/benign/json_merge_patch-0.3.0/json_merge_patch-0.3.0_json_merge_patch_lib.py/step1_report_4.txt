{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for merging dictionaries with ordered control and creating patches between two dictionaries, likely for configuration management or data synchronization.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments: 'objs', 'kw', 'source', and 'target'. No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points are the use of 'sys.version_info' for version-dependent logic and 'result.move_to_end' or 'move_to_start' for dict ordering, but these are standard operations. No direct sink of untrusted input to external systems is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries ('objs', 'source', 'target') through merge and patch functions, with internal manipulation of dicts and OrderedDicts. No external data output or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden logic are detected. Use of standard library functions and straightforward control flow. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dictionary merging and patch creation, with options for controlling insertion order ('first' or 'last') using 'OrderedDict'. It includes compatibility checks for Python version to use 'move_to_end'. The functions are self-contained and do not interact with external systems or perform malicious operations. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity are detected. The code appears well-structured for intended functionality without hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate utility for dictionary operations with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard library features and performs common data manipulation tasks. Therefore, the malware score is low, and the security risk is minimal.",
