  "purpose": "Utility functions for merging dictionaries with order preservation and creating patches between data structures.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries provided to merge and create_patch functions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through merge_obj and create_patch_obj functions, manipulating nested dictionaries based on keys and values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard dictionary operations, uses version info for compatibility, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utilities for merging nested dictionaries with optional order control and creating patches. It uses safe, well-understood Python features like OrderedDict and sys.version_info for compatibility. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The functions handle nested structures correctly, with clear logic and no obfuscation. The use of version checks is benign, aimed at maintaining compatibility across Python versions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for dictionary operations. It poses no security risks or malware threats. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting benign version-dependent logic. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
