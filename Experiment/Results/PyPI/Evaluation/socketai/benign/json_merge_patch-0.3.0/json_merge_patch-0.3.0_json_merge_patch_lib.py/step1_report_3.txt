{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to merge dictionaries with optional ordering and to create patches representing differences between dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters (objs, source, target, and other function arguments), system version info via sys.version_info, and dict items.",
  "sinks": "Modifies dictionaries, potentially removes keys, or updates data. Uses sys.version_info for version-specific behavior, but does not use external untrusted sources or write data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through merging and patch creation functions, with internal handling of dict data structures. No external data flows or network connections are present.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.version_info to alter behavior based on Python version, but does not perform any suspicious or unnecessary dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates dictionaries, merging and creating patches. It handles dict types carefully, supports OrderedDict for order-sensitive merging, and manages key positioning. No external I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The version-dependent behavior is benign and intended for compatibility. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. Functions are straightforward and adhere to typical data processing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for dictionary merging and patch creation with version-aware features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The use of sys.version_info is for compatibility, not malicious purposes.",
