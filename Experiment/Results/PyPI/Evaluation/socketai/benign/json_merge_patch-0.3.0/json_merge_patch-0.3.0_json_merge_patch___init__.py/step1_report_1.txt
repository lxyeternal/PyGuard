  "purpose": "The code imports two functions, 'merge' and 'create_patch', from a local module named 'lib'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'lib' to access the 'merge' and 'create_patch' functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input, or output is present in this snippet; no sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; it's solely an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a simple relative import; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The snippet contains a single import statement, which is standard for modular Python code. No input/output, data processing, or external network interactions are present. The imported functions' behavior cannot be assessed here but the import itself is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
