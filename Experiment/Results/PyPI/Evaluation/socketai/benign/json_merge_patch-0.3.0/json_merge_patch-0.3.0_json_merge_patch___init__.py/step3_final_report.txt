{
  "purpose": "Import functions 'merge' and 'create_patch' from a local module 'lib'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'lib' relative to the current package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Import statement from local module; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement, typical in Python projects. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain any suspicious behavior. The functions imported could be malicious if their implementations are malicious, but this cannot be determined from the import alone. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
