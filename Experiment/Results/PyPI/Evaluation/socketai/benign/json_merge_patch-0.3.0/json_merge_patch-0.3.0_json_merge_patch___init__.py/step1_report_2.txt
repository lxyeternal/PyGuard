  "purpose": "Import functions 'merge' and 'create_patch' from a local module named 'lib'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'lib' to access its functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis possible with this minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports two functions from a local module within the same package. It does not include any network operations, data handling, or other actions that could pose security risks. Since it is a straightforward import statement, there are no suspicious behaviors or malintent detectable from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It does not demonstrate any malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
