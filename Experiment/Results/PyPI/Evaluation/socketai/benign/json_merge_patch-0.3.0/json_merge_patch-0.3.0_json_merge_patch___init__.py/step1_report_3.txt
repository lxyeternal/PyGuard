  "flows": "No data flow observed; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing two functions from a local module. There are no source-to-sink data flows, no input handling, no network or file operations, and no suspicious code constructs. Without additional context or code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal import statement with no suspicious activity.",
