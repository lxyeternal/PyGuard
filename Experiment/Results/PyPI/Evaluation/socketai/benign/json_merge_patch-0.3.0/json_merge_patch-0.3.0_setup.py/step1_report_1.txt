  "purpose": "Configure and distribute the JSON Merge Patch Python package via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters such as name, version, description, author, author_email, scripts, license, packages, include_package_data, python_requires, url.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user input handling; no potential data leaks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A — all data is static configuration information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setup configuration with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. No dynamic code execution, no user input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns are present. All parameters are typical for open-source package distribution. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration script for publishing a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
