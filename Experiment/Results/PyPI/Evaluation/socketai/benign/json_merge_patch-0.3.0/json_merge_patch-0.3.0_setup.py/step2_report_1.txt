  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard `setup.py` script using setuptools with static, hardcoded package metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or external data sources are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is a typical packaging script with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: a straightforward `setup.py` with static parameters.\n- No issues are present in the code itself based on the provided snippets and analysis.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are identified in the reports or the code.\n- The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound and consistent.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- Since the code is static, contains no external input, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns, a `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n- The `securityRisk` score of 0 is also appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score of 0 is correct.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is a standard setup script.\n- No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a conventional, static `setup.py` script with no malicious or suspicious features. It does not process untrusted data, does not contain obfuscation, and does not perform any network or dynamic operations. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, benign package setup script with no security concerns. The scores reflect this, and no further action is needed.",
