  "purpose": "A CLI utility for merging JSON files and creating JSON patches using the json_merge_patch library.",
  "sources": "Files specified via command-line arguments for reading JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Output written to files or printed to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input files are read, processed through json_merge_patch functions, and results are outputted either to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JSON file operations with clear logic, relying on a reputable third-party library. It handles input/output securely, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The security posture is benign, and the code's simplicity reduces risk. External dependencies are standard and trusted, and input handling is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility for JSON merging and patch creation. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The minimal security risk score is appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are zero.",
