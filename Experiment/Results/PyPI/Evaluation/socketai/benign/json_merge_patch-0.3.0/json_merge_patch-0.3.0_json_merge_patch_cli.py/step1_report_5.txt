{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line utilities for merging JSON files using JSON merge patch and creating patch files between JSON files.",
  "sources": "Input JSON files specified by user via command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Output is written to specified files or printed to stdout; no untrusted data is directly used in critical operations",
  "flows": "Input files are read and parsed into JSON objects; merged or patched results are serialized and written out or printed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution beyond standard JSON processing",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python libraries and a third-party json_merge_patch library for JSON operations. Input files are read directly from user-specified paths, and output is written to user-defined locations or printed. There are no apparent data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code does not handle or process untrusted input beyond typical JSON parsing, and no insecure patterns such as eval or exec are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for JSON merging and patch creation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices without suspicious or malicious code components.",
