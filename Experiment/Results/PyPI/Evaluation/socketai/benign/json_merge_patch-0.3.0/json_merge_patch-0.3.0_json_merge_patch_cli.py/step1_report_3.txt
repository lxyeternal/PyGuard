{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line utilities to merge JSON files using JSON merge patch and to create patches between JSON files.",
  "sources": "File reads from specified JSON files for merging and patch creation; output can be printed or written to files.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to files or stdout; no untrusted data processing or external network interactions involved.",
  "flows": "Input files are read into JSON objects, processed with json_merge_patch functions, and results are output to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no unusual code constructs detected. Usage of json_merge_patch is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries and a third-party 'json_merge_patch' module to merge JSON files and create patches. Inputs are files specified via command-line arguments, and outputs are either printed or saved to files. The code performs typical JSON processing without executing untrusted code, evaluating input data, or making network requests. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The structure and logic are straightforward, primarily involving file I/O and JSON operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for JSON merging and patch creation without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle or process untrusted data beyond normal JSON parsing, nor does it include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
