{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line tools for merging JSON files and creating JSON patches using the json_merge_patch library.",
  "sources": "User-supplied JSON files read in 'merge' and 'create_patch' functions; command-line arguments parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Output written to files specified by user or printed to stdout; no untrusted data directly sent over network or to system calls.",
  "flows": "Input files are read and parsed into JSON objects; merged or patched data is serialized and written out or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Use of json_merge_patch library is legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python libraries and a well-known JSON patching library to perform merging and patch creation. It accepts user input files and output destinations via command-line arguments, processes JSON data, and outputs results accordingly. No untrusted data is sent over networks, and no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration or code injection is detected. The code does not contain any malicious logic or backdoors; it appears to be a straightforward utility for JSON manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate JSON processing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates within its intended scope without performing unsafe or malicious actions.",
