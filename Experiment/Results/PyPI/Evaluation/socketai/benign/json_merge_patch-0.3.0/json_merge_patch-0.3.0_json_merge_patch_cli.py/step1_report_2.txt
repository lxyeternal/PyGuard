{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line utilities for merging JSON files and creating JSON patches using the json_merge_patch library.",
  "sources": "Input files specified via command-line arguments; reading JSON data from files.",
  "sinks": "Writing output JSON data to files or printing to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input files are read, processed with json_merge_patch functions, and results are written to output files or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles file input/output and uses an external library (json_merge_patch) to perform JSON merging and patch creation. No untrusted data is processed directly, and no network operations or sensitive data handling are present. The code's flow appears standard for CLI utilities. No suspicious or malicious logic is detected, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful side-effects. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of JSON manipulation functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI utility for JSON merging and patch creation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external libraries and standard file I/O. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
