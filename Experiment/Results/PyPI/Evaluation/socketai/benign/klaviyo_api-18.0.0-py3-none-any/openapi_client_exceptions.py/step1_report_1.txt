{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors and related issues in an OpenAPI-generated client.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are defined statically. The only function accessing data is 'render_path', which processes internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not perform data output, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely for exception handling and message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code structure is standard for API client exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling various HTTP error statuses in an API context. These classes include mechanisms to append contextual information to error messages, such as the request path. The 'render_path' function converts a list of path components into a string, aiding in debugging. All classes and functions serve to facilitate error reporting and do not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. There is no indication of malicious intent or hidden behavior within this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of exception classes for API error handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for structured error reporting and does not perform any harmful actions.",
