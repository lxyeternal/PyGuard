  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for structured API error handling, including error message formatting and path rendering.",
  "sources": "Reads data from http_resp.data for decoding error messages.",
  "sinks": "Decodes http_resp.data, formats error messages, raises exceptions based on HTTP status.",
  "flows": "Source: http_resp.data.decode('utf-8') -> Sink: exception raising with error message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard error handling; minimal decoding of untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for API error handling, decoding response bodies solely for error reporting. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration occurs. Decoding untrusted data is typical in error reporting, with no malicious intent. The code is static, straightforward, and well-structured, with no obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for error handling, with no signs of malware or security risks. The minimal decoding of untrusted data does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and standard for API clients.",
