  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1 & 2:**  \n- Purpose: Define exception classes for API error handling.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external input, no data processing or network activity.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard, benign code for structured error reporting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n- Malware: 0.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.  \n\n**Assessment:** These reports are accurate. The code is straightforward exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Defines exception classes and helper functions, with some data reading (decoding response bodies).  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Reads data from API responses, decodes response data for error reporting.  \n- Anomalies: No suspicious code patterns.  \n- Analysis: Standard error handling; no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, just error reporting.  \n- Confidence: 0.9.  \n- Malware: 0.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.1 (due to decoding response bodies, but this is typical and safe).  \n\n**Assessment:** The decoding of response data is standard and does not introduce security risks. The slight security risk score is justified but minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**  \n- Purpose: Exception classes for error reporting.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Data from HTTP responses and error messages.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: No data manipulation or malicious behavior; primarily error message formatting.  \n- Conclusion: Standard, safe exception handling code.  \n- Confidence: 0.9.  \n- Malware: 0.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (a slightly higher score, but still minimal and justified given the decoding and data handling, which are standard for error reporting).  \n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent or security issues are evident. The minor security risk score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.2, justified by the decoding of response bodies and error message handling, but these are standard practices and do not pose real security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal decoding of response data, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for an API client, with no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The minor security risk score could be slightly increased from 0 to 0.1 to acknowledge the decoding of response bodies, but overall, the security posture is very benign.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score can be set at 0.1 for completeness, but it remains a very low concern.",
