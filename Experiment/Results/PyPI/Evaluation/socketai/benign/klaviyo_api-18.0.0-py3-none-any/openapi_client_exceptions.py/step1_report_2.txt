{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors in an OpenAPI client, along with a helper function for rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; code primarily defines classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; exception handling and message formatting are internal.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; error handling is internal and based on internal exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is standard for API error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from base Python exceptions, used for API error reporting. It includes detailed error messages with path rendering for debugging. The 'render_path' function constructs string representations of error locations. No external inputs, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and standard for API error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of exception classes for API error management. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
