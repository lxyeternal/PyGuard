  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from the `klaviyo_api.wrapper` module and a `__future__` import. There are no signs of code execution, data processing, or network activity. Therefore, there are no issues such as malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk score:** Also 0 or very close to it, which is reasonable given the context.\n\nNo adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are present, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unjustified. The code is purely import statements with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the observable facts. They recognize that import statements alone do not pose security risks.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis: all are low or zero, matching the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThis code snippet is benign and typical of module setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No modifications are needed. The overall assessment remains that this code is safe and does not pose any security concerns.",
