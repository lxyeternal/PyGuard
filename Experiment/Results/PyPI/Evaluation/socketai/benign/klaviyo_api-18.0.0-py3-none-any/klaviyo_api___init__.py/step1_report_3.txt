{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and classes related to the Klaviyo API, likely for interacting with Klaviyo's services.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, and from klaviyo_api.wrapper import KlaviyoAPI and openapi_client",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present; no untrusted data handling or outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this snippet; it only shows import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present; the code is straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, including a future import and imports from an external library 'klaviyo_api.wrapper'. There are no functions, data processing, or executable code that could be malicious. The import statements by themselves are standard and do not indicate malicious intent or backdoors. Since only imports are present, no data flows or anomalies are detected. This code appears to be part of a larger program, and on its own, it does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is benign, consisting only of import statements without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
