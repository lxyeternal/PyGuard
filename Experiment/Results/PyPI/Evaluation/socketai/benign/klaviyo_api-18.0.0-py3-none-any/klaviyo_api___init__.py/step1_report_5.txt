  "purpose": "Importing modules and classes related to the klaviyo_api package, likely for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the klaviyo_api.wrapper module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data output, network, or file operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No executable flow demonstrated; only imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only imports; no anomalies or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and classes from the klaviyo_api package, which appears to be a legitimate API wrapper. No functions, data handling, or executable code is present that could indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The imports are straightforward and typical for setting up API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a benign import statement without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application setup and does not contain harmful or suspicious activity.",
