  "purpose": "This code imports modules from the 'klaviyo_api.wrapper' package, likely for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from '__future__' and 'klaviyo_api.wrapper' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no data handling, network activity, or code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No assumptions are unwarranted, and the code's benign nature is clear. Given the lack of activity or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. The current assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
