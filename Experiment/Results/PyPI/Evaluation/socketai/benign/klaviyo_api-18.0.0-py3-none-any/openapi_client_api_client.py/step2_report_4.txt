  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical API client, with serialization, request handling, and response deserialization.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected.\n- The risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the absence of any security concerns, but since it's an open-source SDK, some minor risk could be assigned.\n- Malware score is correctly 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis confirms no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- The risk score is lower here, which is appropriate.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard API client, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- File handling via temporary files is standard.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical API client with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No obfuscation or malware.\n- The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code or behavior.\n- The analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a typical, well-structured API client SDK with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting minimal security concern, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (standard SDK, minor inherent risk)\n\n**My overall assessment:** The provided scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, open-source API client library with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.  \n- Scores are justified and aligned with the detailed analysis.  \n- No further action required.",
