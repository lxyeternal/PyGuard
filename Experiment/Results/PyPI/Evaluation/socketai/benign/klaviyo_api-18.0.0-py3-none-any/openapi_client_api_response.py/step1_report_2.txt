{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data structure for serializing HTTP responses with type safety and optional headers.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and pydantic; class attributes: status_code, headers, data, raw_data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no potential for data leak or malicious effect from input handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class attributes, which are mainly type-validated; no direct processing of untrusted data beyond validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' in model_config is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a parameterized data model for API responses, leveraging pydantic for validation. It uses type variables for generic data payloads. The model allows arbitrary types, which could be a concern if untrusted types are used maliciously, but in this context, it is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No sensitive data handling, insecure operations, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured data model for API responses with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard patterns without harmful behaviors.",
