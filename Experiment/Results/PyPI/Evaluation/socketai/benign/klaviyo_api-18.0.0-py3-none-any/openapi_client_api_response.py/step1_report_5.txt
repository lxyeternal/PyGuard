  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model using Pydantic for data validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, typing, and pydantic modules.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data is defined as a model with specified types, no runtime data flow or external data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Model configuration uses a dictionary, which is correct but slightly unconventional (should be class Config).",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic response object with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. It uses pydantic's BaseModel and typing for validation. The use of TypeVar allows for flexible data typing. The model_config is assigned as a dictionary, but in Pydantic, the standard way is to define an inner Config class; this might be a minor implementation detail but not malicious. No external data or code execution observed. No suspicious imports or code behavior. Overall, it's a straightforward data model with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard API response data model without any malicious behavior. The structure is typical, and no suspicious or harmful code patterns are present.",
