{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model using Pydantic for serialization and validation.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code does not read external input or data sources beyond defining the class.",
  "targets": "None; no untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink as there is only class definition without data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel subclass for encapsulating API responses with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. It uses type hints and Pydantic validation features properly. The 'model_config' dictionary is set to allow arbitrary types, which is standard for flexible models. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a straightforward data model definition without side effects or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign model definition for API responses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
