{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object for handling HTTP responses with deserialized data, headers, status code, and raw data.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and pydantic; class definition and field declarations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or execution; no dynamic execution or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the data and raw_data fields; no external sinks or data manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' set to True, which could permit untrusted types but is not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic class for API responses using pydantic models, allowing flexible data types. It employs standard typing and pydantic features without any suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation. No dynamic execution, network calls, or credential handling are present. The only noteworthy aspect is permissive model configuration, which is not inherently malicious but could be misused if combined with untrusted data sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and secure model definition for API responses. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are apparent based on this fragment.",
