  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data structure for serialization/deserialization using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines a class with static fields and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data flow observed in static code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' in model_config can allow any type, which may bypass some Pydantic validation, but this is a feature, not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic API response class with type parameterization, optional headers, and raw data handling. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' might increase flexibility but could bypass some type safety, though it is not inherently malicious. There are no external inputs, outputs, or side effects indicating malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of a response object model using Pydantic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
