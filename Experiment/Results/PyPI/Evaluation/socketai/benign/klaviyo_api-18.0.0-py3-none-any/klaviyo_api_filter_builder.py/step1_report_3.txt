{
  "purpose": "This code constructs filter strings for querying data, allowing various comparison and matching operations on fields.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to filter methods such as 'field' and 'value', which are supplied by the user or calling code.",
  "sinks": "The constructed filter strings appended to the 'self.filters' list; these are later joined and potentially used in data queries or API requests.",
  "flows": "User inputs ('field', 'value') -> validation in filter methods -> '_add_value_filter' processing -> string formatting and sanitization -> filters appended to 'self.filters' -> 'build' method returns concatenated filter string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 're.sub' to remove quotes around datetime values; no clear evidence of malicious code or backdoors. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution is observed. All data manipulations are standard and safe. The code does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to build query filters with validation on input types, ensuring only allowed types are used. String sanitization occurs during filter construction, primarily removing spaces and quotes around datetime values, which are safe operations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The only potential concern is the use of 're.sub' to modify datetime string formatting, but it appears to be intended for correct query syntax and not malicious. Overall, the logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign filter builder with standard input validation and string processing. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a safe utility for constructing query filters.",
