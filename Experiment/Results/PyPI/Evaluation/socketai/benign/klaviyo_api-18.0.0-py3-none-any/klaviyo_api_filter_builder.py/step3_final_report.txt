  "purpose": "A filter builder class for constructing query filter strings with type validation and datetime formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'field' and 'value', especially in methods like _add_value_filter where 'value' is processed and formatted.",
  "sinks": "Constructed filter strings appended to self.filters, used later in query execution or data filtering.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters into _add_value_filter, where type checks and formatting occur, then into filter string construction, and finally stored in self.filters.",
  "anomalies": "The regex operation re.sub(\"'\", '', f'{value}') that removes quotes from datetime ISO strings is unusual; likely intended for formatting but could affect string correctness.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type validation, converts datetime objects to ISO format, and constructs filter strings safely. The removal of quotes around datetime strings is a formatting choice, not malicious. No network activity, code injection, or external system interaction is present. The use of json.dumps for serialization is safe. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign filter builder utility with proper input validation and formatting. The regex operation removing quotes from datetime strings is unusual but not malicious. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
