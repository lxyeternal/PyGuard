  "purpose": "A utility class for building filter expressions for data queries, supporting various comparison operations and string matching.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as field names and filter values, especially in methods like equals, less_than, contains, starts_with, etc.",
  "sinks": "Constructed filter strings appended to the filters list, and ultimately returned as a combined string via build(). No direct sinks for untrusted data into dangerous system functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters through type checks and transformations, then into filter string construction, which is stored in self.filters.",
  "anomalies": "The code processes datetime objects into ISO format strings; uses regex substitution to remove quotes in datetime filter values, which may be unnecessary or suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a filter builder class that converts various data types into string representations for filtering purposes. It verifies input types, transforms datetime objects to ISO format, and constructs filter expressions with various operators. The only unusual behavior is the regex substitution removing quotes from datetime strings, which may be intended for formatting but is not inherently malicious. The class does not perform any network activity, system calls, or data exfiltration. It operates solely on input parameters to generate filter strings, which are likely used elsewhere in a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign filter builder utility with no signs of malicious intent or behavior. The only minor anomaly is the regex removal of quotes from datetime strings, which is unlikely to be malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious actions detected.",
