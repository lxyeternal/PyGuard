{
  "purpose": "The code constructs filter strings for querying data, supporting various comparison and string operations.",
  "sources": "User-provided input via function parameters such as 'field' and 'value', especially in methods like equals(), contains(), starts_with(), and any().",
  "sinks": "String manipulation functions, particularly in _add_value_filter() where filter strings are built and appended to self.filters.",
  "flows": "Input values flow through _add_value_filter() where they are validated, possibly formatted (e.g., datetime to ISO), and then incorporated into filter strings; these strings are stored in self.filters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network operations are present. Use of regex and string replacements appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The only minor concern is the regex operation removing single quotes around datetime ISO strings, which is benign but unusual.",
  "analysis": "The class primarily handles input validation, formatting, and string construction for filters. It validates types, converts datetime objects to ISO format, and sanitizes the final filter strings by removing spaces and surrounding quotes around datetime. All data handling appears to be limited to string formatting and list validation; no external or dangerous operations are performed. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or hidden behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward, with proper type checks and input validation. The only noteworthy point is the removal of single quotes from datetime strings, which could be a formatting choice but does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard filter-building utility with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs input validation and constructs safe filter strings without executing untrusted code or performing unsafe operations.",
