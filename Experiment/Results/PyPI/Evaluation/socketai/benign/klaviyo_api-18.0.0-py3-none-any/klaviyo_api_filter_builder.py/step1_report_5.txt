  "purpose": "The code constructs filters for querying data based on various conditions such as equality, comparison, containment, and existence.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to filter methods (field names and values), especially user-provided data for filter criteria.",
  "sinks": "The _add_value_filter method which constructs filter strings that are stored in the filters list; also, json.dumps in _toJson method used for serialization.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> filter methods -> _add_value_filter -> filter string construction -> stored in filters list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of re.sub to remove single quotes from datetime serialization, which suggests handling of datetime values as strings; no other suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a filter builder class that allows constructing filter strings for queries, with validation for input types, and formatting of datetime objects. It uses regex to remove quotes from datetime ISO strings, which is a standard workaround, not malicious. The json.dumps method is used for JSON serialization of values, which is safe. There is no evidence of malicious code or suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code's primary purpose is data filtering, and it functions within expected bounds without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard filter builder utility with proper input validation and serialization; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity, and its design is consistent with typical data filtering logic.",
