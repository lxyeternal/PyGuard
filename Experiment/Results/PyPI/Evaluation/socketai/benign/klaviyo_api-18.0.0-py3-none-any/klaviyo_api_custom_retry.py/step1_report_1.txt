{
  "purpose": "Implement exponential backoff retry logic for API calls, handling specific retryable error codes.",
  "sources": "Reading retry codes, number of retries, maximum interval, and exception headers from ApiException; reading current time via time.time(); reading 'Retry-After' header.",
  "sinks": "Calling the provided function with arguments; sleeping for calculated backoff time via time.sleep().",
  "flows": "On exception, retrieve 'Retry-After' header and timestamp; determine if retry is allowed; if so, sleep for backoff time and retry the function call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. Use of randomization in backoff is standard practice; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for retrying API calls with exponential backoff, incorporating randomness to avoid thundering herd effects. It reads input data from parameters and exception headers, and controls flow through retry logic and sleep intervals. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present; the logic appears to be a standard retry mechanism. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The use of randomness and retry headers aligns with common best practices in resilient network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard exponential backoff retry pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. Overall security risk is low.",
