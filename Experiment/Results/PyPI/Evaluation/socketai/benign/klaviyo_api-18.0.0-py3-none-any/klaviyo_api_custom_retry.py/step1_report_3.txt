{
  "purpose": "This code implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism for API calls, handling retries with configurable parameters to avoid hitting rate limits or errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method arguments, class attributes, and exception headers. Specifically, it reads 'headers' from ApiException and 'retry_codes' from initialization.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to 'func_to_call' which executes the API function. The code also performs 'time.sleep' to wait between retries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters into the retry logic. When an ApiException occurs, headers are checked for 'Retry-After' to determine wait time before retrying. The function 'func_to_call' is called, and upon exception, the code may retry based on headers and retry count.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code detected. Randomness is used for wait time variation, which is normal. The code handles retries and exponential backoff as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an exponential backoff retry pattern. It reads API headers for 'Retry-After' to determine wait times and retries API calls with controlled attempts. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of randomness in backoff is typical for avoiding thundering herd issues. No secret or sensitive information is handled insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate retry mechanism with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It properly handles API retries with exponential backoff, uses exception handling appropriately, and does not contain hidden or malicious payloads.",
