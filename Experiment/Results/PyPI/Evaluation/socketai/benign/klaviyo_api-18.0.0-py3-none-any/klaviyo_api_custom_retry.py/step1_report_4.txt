{
  "purpose": "Implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism for API calls, handling retries on specified error codes with optional 'Retry-After' headers.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from API exception headers, especially 'Retry-After' values, and uses time functions for controlling retry timing.",
  "sinks": "Uses time.sleep() to pause execution between retries; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "When an ApiException occurs, retrieves 'Retry-After' header (if present), then calculates exponential backoff delay with randomness, and retries the function call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The randomization in backoff is standard. No obfuscated code present. No data leakage or malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a retry class with exponential backoff, handling specific API error codes and optional 'Retry-After' headers. It employs standard libraries (time, random) and well-structured logic. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of randomness in backoff is typical to prevent thundering herd issues. No insecure practices such as unsafe data handling or code injection are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an exponential backoff retry strategy for API calls. It appears legitimate and free of malicious intent, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The code is well-structured and adheres to best practices, presenting no security risks.",
