{
  "purpose": "Implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism for handling API exceptions, particularly for retries after specific error codes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from exception object headers ('Retry-After'), time module for timing, and random module for jitter in backoff delays.",
  "sinks": "Uses time.sleep() to pause execution, potentially affecting system responsiveness but not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Exception handling captures API exceptions; retrieves 'Retry-After' header; calculates sleep durations with randomness; retries function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors. Proper use of randomness and exception handling. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for retrying API calls with exponential backoff, incorporating randomness to avoid thundering herd effects. It handles ApiException by checking status codes and 'Retry-After' headers, sleeping accordingly before retrying. Uses standard modules (time, random) appropriately. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious network behavior. The logic appears legitimate and well-structured for retry management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate retry mechanism for API calls with exponential backoff, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for such mechanisms and does not exhibit any malicious or malicious-like behavior.",
