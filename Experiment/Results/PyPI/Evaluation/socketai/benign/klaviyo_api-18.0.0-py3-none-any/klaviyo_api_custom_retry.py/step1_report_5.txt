{
  "purpose": "Implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism for API calls that may encounter transient errors.",
  "sources": "Reads API exception responses, specifically 'Retry-After' headers and exception status codes.",
  "sinks": "Uses time.sleep() to pause execution; potential indirect impact on system timing but not malicious.",
  "flows": "API call within 'with_retry' -> exception handling -> retry decision -> sleep -> next attempt.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or data leaks. Uses standard libraries and exception handling appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a controlled retry mechanism with exponential backoff, handling 'Retry-After' headers from API responses. It uses randomness to prevent thundering herd issues. No embedded malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's structure is straightforward, focusing on retry logic without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard retry with exponential backoff implementation for API calls. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. It appears safe and intended for reliability purposes.",
