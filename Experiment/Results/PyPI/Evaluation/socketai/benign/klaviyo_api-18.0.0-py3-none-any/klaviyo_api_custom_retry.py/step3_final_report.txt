{
  "purpose": "Implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API calls, handling 'Retry-After' headers and avoiding thundering herd effects.",
  "sources": "Reads 'Retry-After' from ApiException headers, input parameters for retry logic, and timing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially delays or retries based on untrusted header values, but handled safely; no data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads 'Retry-After' header -> calculates wait time with randomness -> retries API call -> handles exceptions and headers accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard modules, and follows common retry patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard exponential backoff retry class with proper handling of 'Retry-After' headers, exception management, and randomness to prevent thundering herd. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, standard implementation. The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured retry mechanism with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
