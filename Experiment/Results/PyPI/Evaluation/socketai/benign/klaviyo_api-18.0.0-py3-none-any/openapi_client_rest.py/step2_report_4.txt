  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code to verify the presence of issues, logical flaws, or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard HTTP client with SSL, proxy, and request handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. Proxy validation is limited to protocol support, which is standard. The low malware score aligns with the absence of malicious logic.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request handling, SSL, proxy support, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Proxy URL validation and request processing are standard. No malicious patterns are identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard REST client with SSL, proxy, and request configuration. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of obfuscation or malicious code. Proxy handling is based on user input, which is typical.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusions are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature of the code and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward implementation. Handling of untrusted data is typical for an HTTP client, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a legitimate REST client with configurable SSL and proxy, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent with the code structure and functionality.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual malicious code or vulnerabilities. The code is a standard HTTP client with configurable options.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** The security risk score of 0.2 seems to reflect general concerns about handling untrusted inputs (e.g., proxy URLs, headers). This is reasonable but does not indicate a serious threat.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Could be slightly lowered to **0.1** if we consider the potential for misuse of user-supplied URLs or headers, but 0.2 is acceptable given typical network code considerations.\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present                        |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 - 0.2           | Standard network handling; potential misuse of user input, but no active threat |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears benign, well-structured, and aligned with standard practices. No evidence of malicious intent or malware.",
