  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. No detailed reasoning or analysis provided.\n- **Assessment:** The report notes an \"Empty response\" but provides no context or explanation. Given the code, an empty response could occur if an API call returns no data, but this is common and not inherently malicious.\n- **Security implications:** No suspicious behavior or malware indicators. The report lacks depth and doesn't identify any issues.\n- **Verdict:** No evidence of malware or security risk. The \"error\" seems to be a runtime or API response issue, not code-based.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change; risk remains very low (0.1), malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client with retry and pagination, no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes that URL parsing and unquoting are standard, and no secrets or backdoors are present. It notes the code is well-structured, with typical retry logic.\n- **Security implications:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Justification for scores:** Malware score 0 is justified; risk score 0.2 is reasonable given the complexity but no evident security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Score adjustment:** None; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 2, emphasizing standard patterns, no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** The code's URL handling is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are found. The retry logic is typical.\n- **Security implications:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2 seem justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no changes needed.\n\n**Score adjustment:** None.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the URL processing of 'page_cursor' parameters, which involves unquoting and splitting URLs.\n- **Analysis:** The URL handling is standard for pagination tokens. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is a typical API wrapper with retry logic.\n- **Security implications:** No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n**Score adjustment:** None.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on the cursor URL parsing and retry logic.\n- **Analysis:** The URL parsing is safe and standard; no injection or malicious behavior. The code appears auto-generated and structured.\n- **Security implications:** No malicious signals, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.1 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Score adjustment:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard API client with retry and pagination handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero due to the complexity and extensive method wrapping, but no actual security risks are evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear, structured, and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — minimal, primarily due to the extensive code structure and URL handling, but no real vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Notes:\n- The URL parsing in `_page_cursor_update` is standard for pagination tokens and does not introduce security risks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The retry logic is a common pattern for resilient API clients.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated, which is typical for API SDKs.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The scores should remain at malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, and risk around 0.2.",
