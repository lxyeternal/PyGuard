  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a Configuration class managing API keys, tokens, SSL, logging, host URL, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive data (API keys, tokens, credentials) flow into headers, logs, and URLs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is standard for SDK configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on API keys, auth, logging, SSL, host URL.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive info used in headers, debug info, host URL generation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no external data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, standard SDK code. Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—configuration for API client, handling API keys, tokens, SSL, logging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive data into headers, URLs, logs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, managing API connection settings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API keys, tokens, SSL, logs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard SDK code, safe. Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration for API access, host, keys, tokens.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API keys, headers, URLs, logs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity or data leaks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Typical SDK setup, no malicious signs. Confidence 1, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in the code snippets.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code is standard configuration logic handling sensitive data appropriately, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports' low risk scores)\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is a typical SDK configuration class managing API keys, tokens, SSL, and logging. It does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code, nor does it perform any suspicious network activity or data exfiltration. The sensitive data is stored securely and only used in header generation, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The logs can be configured to output debug info, but that is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain report does not indicate any malicious or security-compromising behavior. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
