  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client configuration class; no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; sensitive data stored securely; logging can be misused if misconfigured but not inherently dangerous.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low), Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no malicious indicators. The low security risk score is appropriate. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; focuses on potential data leaks via logs or debug info.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets; logging setup is standard; no external network activity or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; emphasizes that sensitive data could leak if logs are misused.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code; no data exfiltration or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code is standard configuration, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API configuration class; no signs of malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, emphasizing no malicious intent or code injection.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a straightforward configuration class.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely configuration management.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on zero.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable considering the potential for sensitive data leaks if logs are misused, but overall very low.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a typical SDK configuration class managing API keys, tokens, SSL, and host URLs.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n- Sensitive data is stored in attributes and used in headers, but this is standard practice.\n- Logging setup could be misused if logs contain secrets, but the code itself does not log secrets by default.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable, standard code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Very low; mainly potential data leakage if logs are misused, but not inherent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the code is benign. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I agree with their assessments.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The supply chain security risk for this code is minimal, and it appears safe.",
