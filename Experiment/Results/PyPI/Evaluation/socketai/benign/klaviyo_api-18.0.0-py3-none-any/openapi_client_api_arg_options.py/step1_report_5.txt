  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple constant assignment with no hidden or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a string literal to a variable named USE_DICTIONARY_FOR_RESPONSE_DATA. There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are evident. This appears to be a configuration flag or a placeholder constant, which by itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward constant assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It likely serves as a configuration flag or placeholder within a larger codebase.",
