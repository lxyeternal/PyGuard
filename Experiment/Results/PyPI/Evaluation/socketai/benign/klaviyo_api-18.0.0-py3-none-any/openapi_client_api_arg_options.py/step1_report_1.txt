  "purpose": "Define a string constant named USE_DICTIONARY_FOR_RESPONSE_DATA",
  "sources": "Assignment statement reading no external input, defining a string constant",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None, as there are no input/output or data flow paths",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; the code is simply a variable assignment with a descriptive name",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting a string constant. There are no input sources, no data processing, no sinks, and no evident malicious behavior. The variable name suggests it might be used for configuration or control flow elsewhere, but on its own, it does not indicate any security risk or malware. No obfuscation, no hidden logic, and no malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign variable assignment defining a constant string. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risk evident from this snippet.",
