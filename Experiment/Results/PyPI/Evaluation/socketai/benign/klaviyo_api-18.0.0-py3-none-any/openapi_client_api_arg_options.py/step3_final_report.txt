  "purpose": "Define a configuration constant used within the larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward constant declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string value to a variable, serving as a configuration flag. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors. The code is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the code's simplicity and lack of complexity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward constant declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All analyses and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
