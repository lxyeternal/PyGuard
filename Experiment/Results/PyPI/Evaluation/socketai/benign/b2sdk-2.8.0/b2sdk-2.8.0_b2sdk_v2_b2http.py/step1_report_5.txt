{
  "purpose": "This module overrides error translation for HTTP interactions within the B2 SDK, specifically handling bucket ID not found errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, b2sdk modules, and local exception modules. The class method _translate_errors that calls a superclass method and handles exceptions.",
  "sinks": "The method _translate_errors may raise exceptions based on the caught error, which could influence flow control but does not directly interact with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The method calls the superclass's _translate_errors; upon catching specific exceptions, it raises a local exception. No external or untrusted data flows into potentially malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward inheritance and exception handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is an extension of an existing class to customize error handling. It imports necessary modules, defines a subclass, and overrides a method. The overridden method wraps a superclass method call in a try-except block, catching a specific exception and raising a local exception. No data from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign override of error translation logic, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply customizes exception handling behavior for specific error conditions.",
