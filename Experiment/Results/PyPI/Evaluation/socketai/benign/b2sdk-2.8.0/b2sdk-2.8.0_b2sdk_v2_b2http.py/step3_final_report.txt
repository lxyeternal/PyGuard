{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass of B2Http that overrides the _translate_errors method to catch a specific exception (v3BucketIdNotFound) and re-raise it as a local BucketIdNotFound exception, primarily for backward compatibility or error clarity.",
  "sources": "The method _translate_errors, which calls the superclass method and catches exceptions; the import of v3 and exception classes.",
  "sinks": "The re-raising of the BucketIdNotFound exception, which affects error handling flow but does not lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input: Calling _translate_errors; Exception: v3BucketIdNotFound is caught; Output: Raising local BucketIdNotFound exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard exception handling, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass override that enhances error handling by translating a specific exception. It imports modules, defines a subclass, and overrides a class method with a try-except block. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The exception translation is a common pattern for SDK compatibility. The high confidence scores (near 1) are justified given the code's simplicity and benign intent. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity exists. The risk score is 0, reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code's purpose is purely for exception handling, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard subclass override for exception translation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriate at 0, and the risk score should be 0.0, indicating minimal risk. The reports are accurate, and the code is safe for use.",
