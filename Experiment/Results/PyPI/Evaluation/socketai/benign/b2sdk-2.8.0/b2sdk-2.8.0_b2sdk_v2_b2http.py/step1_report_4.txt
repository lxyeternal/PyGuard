{
  "purpose": "This module extends the B2Http class to override error translation behavior for specific exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules, class method _translate_errors which calls a superclass method",
  "sinks": "Superclass method call, raising custom exception, potential error handling logic",
  "flows": "Input function 'fcn' and 'post_params' are passed to the superclass method; exceptions caught and re-raised as custom exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a subclass of v3.B2Http, and overrides a class method. The overridden method calls the parent method within a try-except block, catching a specific exception from v3 and re-raising it as a local exception. The structure and flow are straightforward and typical for error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads present. No suspicious data flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard subclass override for error translation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign extension for error handling customization.",
