{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of B2Http that overrides error translation to maintain compatibility with an older exception type.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules and class methods, particularly the super()._translate_errors function and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a custom exception BucketIdNotFound based on an error caught from a third-party or internal library.",
  "flows": "The method _translate_errors calls the superclass method, catches a specific exception (v3BucketIdNotFound), and raises a different exception (BucketIdNotFound).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code performs standard subclassing and exception translation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, subclassing an existing class to override error handling behavior. It imports modules and exceptions, then provides a class method that wraps a call to the superclass's method, handling a specific exception by raising a custom one. No input sources or data sinks that could be exploited are present; the flow is simple error handling logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, harmless subclass meant to maintain compatibility with previous exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
