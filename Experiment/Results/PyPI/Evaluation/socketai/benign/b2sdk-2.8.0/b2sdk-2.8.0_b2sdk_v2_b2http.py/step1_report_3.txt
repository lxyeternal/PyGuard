{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of the B2Http class to handle specific error translation behavior for Backblaze B2 SDK operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and the method _translate_errors which calls the superclass method with given parameters.",
  "sinks": "The only significant sink is the re-raising of exceptions, which occurs in the error translation process.",
  "flows": "The method _translate_errors calls the superclass method and, upon catching a specific exception (v3BucketIdNotFound), raises a different exception (BucketIdNotFound), translating error types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily performs error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a subclass to override error translation behavior, and implements a method that tries to execute the superclass's error translation function. If a specific exception (v3BucketIdNotFound) occurs, it raises a different, possibly more user-friendly exception (BucketIdNotFound). The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. It performs controlled error handling within the SDK context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard subclass override for error translation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It aims to provide compatibility or improved error handling in the SDK. Overall, the code appears benign and focused solely on exception management.",
