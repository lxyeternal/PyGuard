{
  "purpose": "This code defines subclasses for simulating bucket and raw upload functionalities, mainly to handle file uploads with optional cache control headers in a cloud storage SDK.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as upload URLs, auth tokens, file metadata, data streams, and optional headers like cache control.",
  "sinks": "The code writes headers and file info, particularly adding 'b2-cache-control' to file_info, and calls superclass methods that handle network communication for uploads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (including metadata and optional headers) into the file_info dictionary, which may be used in network requests via superclass methods for uploading files or headers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code only manipulates metadata and delegates upload operations to superclass methods without performing malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The classes extend existing SDK components to add optional cache control headers before invoking parent class methods for file uploads. No suspicious or malicious logic, no hardcoded credentials, and no data exfiltration or malicious network activity is evident. The code appears to be standard extension code for handling optional headers in upload requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of SDK classes to include optional cache control headers during file uploads. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves a legitimate purpose within the SDK context.",
