{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for simulating B2 cloud storage operations, specifically uploading files and retrieving upload headers.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include function parameters such as upload URLs, auth tokens, file metadata, and data streams. External inputs are received via method arguments, especially untrusted data like file_info and data_stream.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the super().upload_file and super().get_upload_file_headers calls, which handle untrusted input data for upload operations. Modifications to file_info, especially setting 'b2-cache-control', could influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (source) into the super() method calls (sink). Modification of file_info with cache_control influences the data sent in the upload headers or upload process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors, are detected. The code relies on standard class inheritance and method overrides, with no unusual logic or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of v3.BucketSimulator and v3.RawSimulator with overridden methods to insert or modify the 'b2-cache-control' header in file_info dictionaries before calling the superclass methods. There is no evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The modifications are straightforward, meant to augment upload metadata. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard simulation or extension for a cloud storage SDK, primarily adding optional cache-control headers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The structure and logic are consistent with legitimate functionality.",
