  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code extends SDK classes to add optional cache control headers during uploads. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Analysis:** The code only modifies `file_info` to include `b2-cache-control` if specified, then delegates to superclass methods. No network activity or malicious logic is present.  \n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0.0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — accurate.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high, given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on testing/mocking, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Analysis:** The code wraps superclass methods, adding cache control headers as needed, with no suspicious code.  \n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0.0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — accurate.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign extension for simulation/testing, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis:** Straightforward method overrides, adding optional headers, delegating to parent classes. No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0.0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — accurate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code is benign and intended for testing or simulation.  \n- **Analysis:** The code adds optional cache control headers before calling superclass methods, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0.0 — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — accurate.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard SDK extension, adding optional headers, no malicious intent.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The modifications are benign.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — justified.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — accurate.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected. The code only modifies metadata and delegates to superclass methods.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, just adding headers in a test/mock environment.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the code. No adjustments needed.\n- **Potential concerns:** None. The code appears legitimate, well-structured, and intended for simulation or testing purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — clear code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the modification of headers, but this is standard and benign.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No security issues or malicious behavior are present.",
