{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for simulating file uploads and retrieval of upload headers in a storage SDK, specifically for testing or mocking purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters such as upload IDs, tokens, file names, content metadata, and data streams; also environment variables or external data are not directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to superclass methods 'upload_file' and 'get_upload_file_headers', which handle file data and metadata; no external data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (sources) into the super() calls, with optional modifications such as adding 'b2-cache-control' to 'file_info' before passing to superclass methods.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The methods mainly modify input parameters for legitimate storage SDK operations.",
  "analysis": "The code extends existing SDK classes for simulation purposes, adding a 'b2-cache-control' field to 'file_info' when specified. All operations are confined within method calls to parent classes. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of decorators for renaming 'file_info' suggests consistent data handling, not malicious obfuscation or tampering. The overall structure indicates test or mock functionality rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard simulation or mock implementation intended for testing storage upload functionality. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It simply extends existing SDK classes with minor modifications for simulation purposes.",
