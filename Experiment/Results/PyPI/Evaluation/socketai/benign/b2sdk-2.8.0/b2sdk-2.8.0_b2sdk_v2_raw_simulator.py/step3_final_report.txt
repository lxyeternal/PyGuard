{
  "purpose": "The code extends SDK classes to add optional 'b2-cache-control' headers during file upload operations, primarily for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as 'file_info' and 'cache_control'.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies 'file_info' dictionaries by adding 'b2-cache-control' entries before delegating to superclass methods, which handle actual upload or header retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'cache_control' influence 'file_info', which is then used in superclass methods that perform uploads or header retrieval, establishing a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward, primarily adding headers for testing or simulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses that override methods to insert optional cache control headers into 'file_info' dictionaries before calling parent class methods. The logic is simple, consistent, and intended for testing or extension, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The code does not perform network activity, handle secrets, or contain obfuscation. The minimal risk stems from the potential misuse of header modification in untrusted contexts, but overall, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension for simulation or testing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
