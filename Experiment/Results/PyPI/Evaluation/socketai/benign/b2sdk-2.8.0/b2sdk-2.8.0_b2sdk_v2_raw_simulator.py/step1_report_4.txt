{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simulator for B2 cloud storage SDK, specifically for uploading files and handling upload headers in a test or simulated environment.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as upload_id, upload_auth_token, file_name, content_length, content_type, content_sha1, file_info, data_stream, and optional parameters like cache_control.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or modifications occur when the code sets or modifies the 'b2-cache-control' in file_info and when calling super().upload_file and super().get_upload_file_headers with these parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters, especially cache_control, can modify file_info before passing to superclass methods; these methods then perform upload or header retrieval operations with the possibly modified data.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes repetitive setting of 'b2-cache-control' in file_info, but no malicious or suspicious logic such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code is present. It appears to be straightforward method overrides with no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code implements subclass overrides for uploading files and retrieving headers, adding optional cache control headers to file_info dictionaries before delegating to parent class methods. No suspicious behaviors, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are evident. It is likely a test or mock implementation designed to simulate B2 SDK behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code is detected. The code structure and purpose appear benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign SDK simulation code intended for testing or development purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
