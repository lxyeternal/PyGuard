{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simulation class for uploading files to a storage system, extending functionality from an existing SDK, primarily for testing or mock purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for upload_file and get_upload_file_headers methods, including upload URLs, tokens, file info, and data streams.",
  "sinks": "Super calls to parent class methods with input parameters; modification of file_info dictionary by adding 'b2-cache-control' key.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters through conditional modifications (adding cache control), then into parent class methods which handle the actual upload or header retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unusual logic present. Usage of standard method overrides and straightforward dictionary modification.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical extension of a SDK with methods wrapping parent class functions. It conditionally adds a cache control header to the file_info dictionary before passing data to superclass methods. No data leaks, external network communications, or malicious logic are present. The structure and content are consistent with test or simulation purposes, without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension of SDK classes for simulation or testing purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs standard method wrapping with minor data modification, which does not pose any security concern.",
