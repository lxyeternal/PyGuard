{
  "purpose": "The code extends a third-party SDK's Bucket class, adding exception handling and method overrides for uploading and listing files, primarily serving as a wrapper or compatibility layer.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as data_bytes, local_file, file_name, folder_to_list, filters, and other arguments passed into the class methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to superclass methods (super().upload_bytes, super().upload_local_file, super().ls), which handle file uploads and listings; no external network or system modifications are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK method calls via super() methods; data is processed internally within SDK functions without external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Exception handling is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of an SDK, primarily adding exception translation and method overrides. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The logic is standard, and the data flow is confined within SDK calls. The exception handling is typical for SDK wrappers, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK extension with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with its straightforward, standard nature. Overall, it poses minimal security risk and appears safe for supply chain purposes.",
