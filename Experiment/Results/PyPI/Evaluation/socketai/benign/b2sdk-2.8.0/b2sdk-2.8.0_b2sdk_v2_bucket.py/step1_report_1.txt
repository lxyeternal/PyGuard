{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Bucket class extending a third-party SDK for file storage, adding exception handling and method overrides, as well as a factory for creating Bucket instances.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters (e.g., data_bytes, local_file, folder_to_list) and imports from external modules.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with external systems via super().method() calls, but no direct untrusted data sinks like network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to superclass methods without significant transformation; exception handling wraps SDK exceptions; no data flows directly to external systems within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are observed. The code mainly consists of method overrides and exception handling. No hidden backdoors or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides extended functionality to an SDK class by overriding methods for uploading bytes and files, with added exception handling for specific SDK exceptions. The list method modifies folder path strings to conform with a virtual folder hierarchy. The factory class simply returns instances of the custom Bucket class. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communications, or backdoors. The code appears to be well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious code segments identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard extension of a storage SDK with exception handling and method overrides. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this snippet. It appears to be safe and intended for legitimate use.",
