{
  "purpose": "This code defines wrapper classes for threading, download, and upload management, extending existing classes from the b2sdk library.",
  "sources": "Imports from the b2sdk library and internal utils, no external input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no handling of untrusted data or external output in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply defines class inheritance without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior observed. The code appears to be straightforward class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and extends existing classes without adding additional logic. It acts as a thin wrapper or alias layer, which is typical for SDK interface adaptation. No suspicious behavior, no data handling, and no malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple extension layer of the b2sdk library, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It does not process external data nor perform any insecure operations.",
