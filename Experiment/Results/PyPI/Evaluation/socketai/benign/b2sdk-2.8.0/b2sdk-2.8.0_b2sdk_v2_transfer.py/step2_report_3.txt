  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code in question is minimal, consisting solely of subclass definitions that extend existing classes from the `b2sdk` library.\n- There are no data manipulations, external inputs, network communications, or any form of data processing.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, structural, and likely serves organizational or extension purposes within the SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence:\n- The code matches the described snippets exactly.\n- The classes are simple subclasses or aliases, with no added logic or behavior.\n- No issues or anomalies are present in the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning in the reports is consistent and correct: the code is benign, structural, and not malicious.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5, which is correct.\n- The code's benign, structural purpose warrants a zero risk score.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is straightforward.\n- The code does not perform any data handling or external operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, and considering the code's simplicity, I concur that:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely structural, extending existing classes without adding logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate.\n- **Overall risk estimate:** Very low; the code is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and not malicious.",
