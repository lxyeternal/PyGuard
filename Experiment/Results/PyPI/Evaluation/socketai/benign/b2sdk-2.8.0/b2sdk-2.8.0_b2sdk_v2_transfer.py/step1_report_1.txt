{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define classes that extend or alias existing classes from the b2sdk library, specifically related to transfer management (download and upload).",
  "sources": "The code imports from the b2sdk package and internal utils, then defines classes that inherit from these imported classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily creates subclasses with no additional logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, acting as simple subclass aliases with no additional logic or data handling; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal classes from the b2sdk package and creates subclasses that do not add or modify functionality. These subclasses may be used elsewhere in the larger application but, in isolation, do not exhibit malicious behavior or security issues. The file appears to serve as a structural or organizational component within the SDK or project, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of class aliases extending existing SDK classes with no additional logic. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and primarily for organizational or structural purposes.",
