{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module that re-exports classes from the internal SDK, likely for API or library organization and extension purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code. It imports modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there is no data processing or input/output in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or hidden behavior. It only defines classes that extend imported classes without additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal SDK modules and defines subclasses that do not add or modify functionality. There are no data manipulations, no environment variable use, no network operations, and no security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a simple extension or aliasing for code organization. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that extends existing SDK classes without adding any logic or behavior that could be malicious. It appears to serve as a wrapper or extension point, with no security issues identified.",
