  "purpose": "Structural subclassing of existing SDK classes for organizational or extension purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input, external communication, or data reading; imports from internal SDK modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines subclasses without logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions that extend existing classes from the b2sdk library, serving as simple subclasses or aliases. There is no data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward, benign, and structurally minimal. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as organizational or extension wrappers within the SDK. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no further action is necessary.",
