  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions that inherit from existing classes in the `b2sdk` library.\n- No additional logic, data handling, network operations, or external inputs are present.\n- The classes serve as simple subclasses or aliases, likely for organizational or extension purposes within the SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code does not contain any malicious, suspicious, or security-related flaws. It is straightforward and minimal.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or security flaws?**  \n  No. The code is minimal, acting as structural wrappers without any added logic or data processing.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code is non-malicious and purely structural.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n### Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- No suspicious claims are made; all assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal set of class definitions that extend existing SDK classes without adding logic, data handling, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, serving as structural or organizational wrappers within the SDK. It does not pose any security risks or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or have additional reports to review.",
