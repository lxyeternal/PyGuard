  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the scores assigned are appropriate, considering the code snippets and the overall context.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All snippets are minimal, containing only license headers and a single import statement (`from __future__ import annotations`).\n- No executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions are present.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or placeholder headers for a Python package's main module.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Entry point script, likely used to initialize or run the SDK.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is just a header.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code snippet. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Main entry point for the SDK.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; only a header and import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Entry point for the SDK.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Entry point for the SDK.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; only a header and import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Entry point for the SDK.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Note:** The security risk score is slightly above zero, but given the minimal code, this is likely an overestimation. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n- **Verdict:** Recommend lowering `securityRisk` to 0, as there's no evidence of risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All zero, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly zero, except report 5 which should also be zero.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0 for all.\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 for all.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, including report 5, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippets are benign boilerplate headers with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The assigned scores are mostly appropriate, with a slight overestimation in report 5's security risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** 0 across all reports.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, and the scores should be uniformly zero, reflecting no security concerns.",
