  "purpose": "Entry point script for the b2sdk package, likely used to initialize or run the SDK.",

  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in the given code segment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, primarily imports annotations and contains only comments and license info. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard header for a Python module with licensing information and an import statement. It does not contain any executable logic, data processing, or external data access points. The import is a future feature annotation, which is common and safe. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate module header with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be the beginning of a Python module with licensing information, providing no security risks.",
