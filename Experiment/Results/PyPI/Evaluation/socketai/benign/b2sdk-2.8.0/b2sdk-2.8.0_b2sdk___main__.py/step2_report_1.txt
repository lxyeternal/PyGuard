  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal header file with licensing info and an import of `__future__.annotations`.\n- No executable code, data input/output, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate, typical for Python modules, especially entry points or main scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **None detected.** The reports correctly identify the code as a standard header with no malicious intent.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Obfuscated score:** Consistently 0 across reports, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of suspicious code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, even 0.1 seems slightly high; a score of 0 would be more appropriate unless there's context suggesting otherwise.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- **Scores above 0.5:** None. All scores are well below this threshold, indicating low risk.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports are cautious but accurate, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the provided code snippet and the reports, I agree with the assessments that this is a benign, boilerplate header with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe header for a Python module, with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the one with 0.1 security risk could be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the broader context of the full codebase; this snippet alone shows no issues.",
