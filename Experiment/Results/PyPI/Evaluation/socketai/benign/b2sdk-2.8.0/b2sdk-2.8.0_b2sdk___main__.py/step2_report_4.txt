  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe the code as minimal, consisting mainly of license comments and an import statement (`from __future__ import annotations`).\n   - No executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign and boilerplate.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the summaries.\n\n3. **Score Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The only slight inconsistency is in report 5, which assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1. Given the code's trivial nature, this seems unwarranted. The risk score should be 0 for such a benign snippet.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports correctly identify the code as non-vulnerable.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no executable or data-processing components.\n\n5. **Malware & Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - The only exception is report 5's security risk score, which should be adjusted to 0.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. The only minor correction is to set report 5's `securityRisk` to 0, aligning with the rest.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard boilerplate header with no security concerns. The scores should reflect that, with all being zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the observed benign nature of the code.",
