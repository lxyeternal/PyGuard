{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal header or entry point script for a Python module, primarily containing licensing information and an import statement for future annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and an import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and contains no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple header with licensing comments and a single import statement. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned in the reports, especially malware and obfuscation scores of zero, are appropriate. The slightly elevated security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unwarranted given the code's simplicity and lack of activity. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate header with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are consistent with its harmless nature. The minimal security risk score should be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
