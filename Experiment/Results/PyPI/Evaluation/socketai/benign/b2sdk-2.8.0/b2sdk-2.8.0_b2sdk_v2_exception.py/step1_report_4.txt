{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the B2 SDK, specifically for handling 'bucket not found' errors and unsupported filenames.",
  "sources": "Import statement from b2sdk._v3.exception, class constructor accepting a bucket_id parameter.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input (bucket_id) -> Exception object creation -> String representation method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from a different module, then creates alias variables for exceptions. It defines a custom exception class 'BucketIdNotFound' inheriting from imported exceptions and BadRequest, with an initializer that sets message and code attributes. The __str__ method relies on the parent class. The code appears to be standard for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines exception classes for SDK error handling without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern for customizing exceptions.",
