  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the B2 SDK, inheriting from imported exceptions and adding specific attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from b2sdk._v3.exception, instantiation of exception classes with parameters",
  "sinks": "String formatting in the __init__ method, __str__ method override",
  "flows": "Creating instances of BucketIdNotFound with bucket_id input, which is incorporated into error messages",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply extends existing exception classes and formats messages",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes from an internal module, defines custom exception subclasses, and overrides __init__ and __str__ methods for better error messages. There are no input/output streams that process untrusted data directly. The exception classes and message formatting are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward extension of exception handling classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It mainly provides clearer error messaging for missing bucket IDs. There are no signs of malware or security issues.",
