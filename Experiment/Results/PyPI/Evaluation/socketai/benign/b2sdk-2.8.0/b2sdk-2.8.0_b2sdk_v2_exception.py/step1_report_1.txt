{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to B2 SDK errors, particularly for handling missing bucket IDs and unsupported filenames.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing all exceptions from a version 3 exception module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flow paths are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from input sources to sinks; the code mainly defines classes and assigns variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can be considered a bad practice, but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from an internal module, defines two alias variables for exception classes, and creates a subclass 'BucketIdNotFound' that customizes its initialization and string representation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import statement could potentially import unintended or malicious exceptions if the module is compromised, but this is unlikely given the context of a standard SDK exception module. Overall, this code segment is straightforward, mainly defining exception classes with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class definition for a SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'import *' warrants attention but is not malicious in itself. Overall, the code appears safe.",
