  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described code with the actual code snippet, and evaluate the risk, malware potential, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exceptions; import from v3.exception.\n- **Findings:** Import *; straightforward class definitions; no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk/Malware:** Score 0.2 and 0 respectively. The report suggests minimal risk, primarily noting the import * as a concern but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The import * could theoretically introduce unintended exceptions if the module is compromised, but given the context, this is unlikely. No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's risk and malware scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exceptions with inheritance and message formatting.\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard exception class extension.\n- **Risk/Malware:** Scores 0 and 0. No suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no external data processing or network activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Custom exceptions, maintaining backward compatibility.\n- **Findings:** Import from a private module; no malicious activity.\n- **Risk/Malware:** 0.1 and 0; very low, considering the import from a private module.\n- **Assessment:** The private import could be a concern if the module is compromised, but within the scope of this code, it’s standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for bucket not found errors.\n- **Findings:** Standard class inheritance and initialization.\n- **Risk/Malware:** 0 and 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior; exception handling code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define exception classes for bucket ID and filename errors.\n- **Findings:** Straightforward class definitions; no external data or network activity.\n- **Risk/Malware:** 0 for both; no malicious signals.\n- **Assessment:** The message formatting could be logged or displayed, but that’s standard and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the code appears obfuscated; all are straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are low, reflecting the non-sensitive, exception-defining nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in an SDK.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The use of 'import *' is a concern but not malicious; it could lead to unintended imports but not a security risk per se.\n- Importing from a private module could be a concern if the module is compromised, but within the scope of this code, it’s standard practice.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to import practices, but overall very low)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is safe and typical for SDK exception handling, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities present.",
