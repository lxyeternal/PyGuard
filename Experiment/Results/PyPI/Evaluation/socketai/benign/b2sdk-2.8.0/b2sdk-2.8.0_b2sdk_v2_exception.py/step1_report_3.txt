{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Backblaze B2 SDK, specifically for handling 'BucketIdNotFound' and 'UnsupportedFilename' errors, with some backward compatibility features.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a private module 'b2sdk._v3.exception' that provides base exception classes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network calls, file operations, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The class 'BucketIdNotFound' inherits from imported exceptions and initializes with a bucket ID, with no external data flow or processing beyond exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the exception classes are straightforward, and there are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code maintains backward compatibility by overriding __str__ method.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for error handling within the SDK, inheriting from base exceptions imported from a private module. It customizes exception messages and maintains backward compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The use of inheritance and exception handling is standard and secure. The import from a private module could be a concern if it points to untrusted code, but that is outside the scope of this code review.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks. No anomalous or malicious behavior is detected. The code is well-structured for its purpose.",
