  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports all exceptions from `b2sdk._v3.exception`.\n- Defines two alias variables: `v3BucketIdNotFound` and `UnSyncableFilename`.\n- Implements a subclass `BucketIdNotFound` inheriting from `v3BucketIdNotFound` and `BadRequest`.\n- Customizes `__init__` to set a message and code, and overrides `__str__` to use the parent class's string representation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code functions as intended: defining custom exceptions for SDK error handling.\n- No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are evident.\n- The import statement `from b2sdk._v3.exception import *` is potentially risky due to `import *`, but this is a known bad practice rather than malicious.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The use of `import *` can lead to namespace pollution or unintended imports, but it doesn't introduce security risks per se.\n- The exception class `BucketIdNotFound` overrides `__str__` to call `BadRequest.__str__`, which is acceptable, but it might be better to call `super().__str__()` for clarity.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor concern due to `import *`, but overall low risk.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to import practices, not active vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The import from a private or internal module (`b2sdk._v3.exception`) could be problematic if the module is compromised, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The code's purpose is purely exception handling; no vulnerabilities are introduced here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n- No change needed unless considering the import practice as a higher risk, but even then, it's minor.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is standard SDK exception handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `import *`, which is a known bad practice but not malicious.\n\n**Estimated final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with report, minor concern due to import style)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain report accurately assesses the code as safe with no malicious intent. The minor concern about `import *` is acknowledged but doesn't constitute a security risk. The overall conclusion is that this code is safe and standard for exception class definitions.",
