  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SDK error handling, inheriting from imported exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import from 'b2sdk._v3.exception' module; exception class initialization with bucket_id; message and code assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Import from internal module -> class inheritance -> exception message and code setting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from internal module; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for SDK errors, inheriting from imported exceptions. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. The class customizations are straightforward, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The import from an internal module could pose a risk if compromised, but within the scope, it is standard practice. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions in an SDK. No malicious intent or security issues are evident. The minor concern about 'import *' does not constitute a security risk. The overall security risk score is 0.1, malware score 0, obfuscated score 0.",
