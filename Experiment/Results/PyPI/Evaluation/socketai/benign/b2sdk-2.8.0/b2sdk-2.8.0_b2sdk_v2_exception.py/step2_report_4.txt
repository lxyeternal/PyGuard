  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores based on the provided code and context.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code primarily defines custom exception classes, importing exceptions from an internal module.\n- The import statement uses `from b2sdk._v3.exception import *`, which is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution but not inherently malicious.\n- The code creates alias variables (`v3BucketIdNotFound`, `UnSyncableFilename`) and a subclass `BucketIdNotFound` that customizes exception message and code.\n- No network activity, data processing, or external I/O is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The import statement using `import *` can be risky if the imported module is compromised or contains malicious code, but given the context (an SDK internal module), this is unlikely to be malicious.\n- The rest of the code is standard exception class definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are apparent. The code functions as intended for exception handling.\n- The use of `super().__init__(bucket_id)` assumes the parent class can accept `bucket_id` as an argument, which is typical for exception classes.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the code's straightforward nature, these seem reasonable.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is mainly defining exception classes.\n- The concern about `import *` is noted, but not enough to raise the risk score significantly.\n- No report claims or implies malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor concern about `import *`, but overall low risk.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- If the imported module `b2sdk._v3.exception` were compromised, that could introduce risk, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The code itself is safe and standard for exception handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, straightforward exception class definition.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual content and behavior.",
