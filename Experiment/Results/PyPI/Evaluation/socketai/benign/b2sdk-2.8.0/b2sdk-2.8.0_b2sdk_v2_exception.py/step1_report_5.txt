{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for the B2 SDK, handling specific error scenarios related to bucket IDs and filename support.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and b2sdk._v3.exception, and class initialization with parameters.",
  "sinks": "String representation of exceptions which could potentially expose messages if improperly logged, but no direct data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Exception class initialization with bucket_id leads to message formatting, which is then used in __str__ method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The exception classes follow typical patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic. No external input handling or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions, defines alias variables, and creates a subclass of existing exceptions with custom attributes. The __init__ method formats a message including bucket_id, which could be logged or displayed. The __str__ method defers to the parent class. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data flow is present. The code appears straightforward and solely related to exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No suspicious patterns or malicious signals are detected.",
