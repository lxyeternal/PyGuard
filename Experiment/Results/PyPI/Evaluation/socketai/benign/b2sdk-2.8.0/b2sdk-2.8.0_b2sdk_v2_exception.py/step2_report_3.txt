  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports all exceptions from `b2sdk._v3.exception`.\n- Defines two alias variables: `v3BucketIdNotFound` and `UnSyncableFilename`.\n- Implements a subclass `BucketIdNotFound` inheriting from `v3BucketIdNotFound` and `BadRequest`.\n- Customizes the `__init__` method to set a message and code.\n- Overrides `__str__` to use the parent class's string representation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code presence:**  \n  The code is straightforward exception class definitions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The use of `import *` is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n\n- **Potential security issues:**  \n  No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation, no external data processing that could be malicious.\n\n- **Import source:**  \n  The import from `b2sdk._v3.exception` is internal; if compromised, it could introduce malicious exceptions, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Define exceptions for missing bucket IDs and unsupported filenames.  \n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no malicious behavior; the import could be risky if compromised but is unlikely.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2 (low), Obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Reasonable, no change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with focus on exception extension and message formatting.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just standard exception class extension.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate, no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for SDK errors, with backward compatibility.  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; import from internal module is noted but not suspicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate, no change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for SDK error handling.  \n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate, no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, exception classes with message formatting.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, standard pattern.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, which is accurate.  \n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern about import practices. Given the context, a risk score of 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0, considering no actual security risk.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious or security-critical issues.\n- The import statement `from b2sdk._v3.exception import *` warrants attention but is not inherently malicious.\n- The risk score could be reduced from 0.1 to 0 for more accuracy, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0** (or possibly 0.1 if considering import practices, but 0 is more precise)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for exception handling, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
