  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code retrieves the installed package version using `importlib.metadata.version('b2sdk')`.\n- It obtains the Python version via `sys.version_info`.\n- It constructs constants `VERSION`, `PYTHON_VERSION`, and `USER_AGENT`.\n- All operations are read-only, using standard library functions, with no external input or network activity.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no signs of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or anomalies. The logic is correct and standard for such metadata definitions.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:**  \n  All reports accurately describe the code as simple, benign, and standard. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  Since the code is purely informational and uses safe, standard library functions, all scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Scores:**  \n  The risk score of 0.0 aligns with the code's benign nature. No reason to assign higher scores.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There are no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n- **Score Consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and the detailed analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a simple, standard version info module with no security issues.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese match the current reports and are justified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, benign module for defining version information. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious elements. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current assessments: all scores at 0, confirming no security concerns.",
