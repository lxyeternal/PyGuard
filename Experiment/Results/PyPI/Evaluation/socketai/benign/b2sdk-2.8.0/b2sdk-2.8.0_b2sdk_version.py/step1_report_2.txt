  "purpose": "Define and expose version-related metadata for the b2sdk package, including the package version, Python version, and user agent string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via importlib.metadata's version function and the system's Python version via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; the code does not output or transmit data directly.",
  "flows": "Retrieving package version and Python version, then constructing a user agent string based on these values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard library functions in a typical manner. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines constants for version info. It fetches the installed package version using importlib.metadata's version() and constructs the Python version string from sys.version_info. It then builds a user agent string. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. No external data is being transmitted or processed insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard metadata module for version information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
