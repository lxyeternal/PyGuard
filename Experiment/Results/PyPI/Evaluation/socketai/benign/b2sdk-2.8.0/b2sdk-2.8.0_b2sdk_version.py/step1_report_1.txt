{
  "purpose": "Define and expose version information for the b2sdk package and the Python environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from PyPI metadata using importlib.metadata.version and the Python version from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None of the data is used in a way that could lead to data leakage, code injection, or other security issues.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves package and Python version data and formats it into constants, which are then used in the USER_AGENT string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code solely performs metadata retrieval and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version information from importlib.metadata and sys, then assigns package version to VERSION, Python version to PYTHON_VERSION, and constructs a user-agent string. All operations are read-only and involve no external input or untrusted data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign version declaration module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
