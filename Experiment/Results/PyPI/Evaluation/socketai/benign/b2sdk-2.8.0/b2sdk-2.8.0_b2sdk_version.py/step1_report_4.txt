{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information and user-agent string for the b2sdk package, primarily for identification and compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code retrieves package version via importlib.metadata and Python version via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The source of package version and Python version flows into constructing the USER_AGENT string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code relies on standard library functions and typical package info retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules to retrieve the package version and Python interpreter version. It then constructs a user-agent string. All operations are read-only and do not involve untrusted input. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, focusing on defining version-related constants for the package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
