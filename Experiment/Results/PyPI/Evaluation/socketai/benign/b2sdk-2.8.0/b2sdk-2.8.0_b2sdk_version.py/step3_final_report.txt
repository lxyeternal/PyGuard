  "purpose": "Retrieve the installed package version and Python version, then construct a user-agent string for identification purposes.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('b2sdk') and sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send or write data externally",
  "flows": "Retrieving package and Python versions, then formatting into constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info from standard libraries, assigns constants based on current environment data, and constructs a user-agent string. It performs no data transmission, no input handling, and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. The logic is simple, clear, and standard for version metadata retrieval. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for version information. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly assess its safety, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 with high confidence. No modifications are necessary.",
