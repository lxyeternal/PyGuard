  "purpose": "Define version information and user agent string for the b2sdk package.",
  "sources": "Importing package version from importlib.metadata and Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data usage or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Import version data and system Python version to construct the USER_AGENT string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information of the 'b2sdk' package and the Python runtime environment, then constructs a user agent string. It is straightforward and standard for defining package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data manipulations indicating malicious intent. The code serves a configuration purpose without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
