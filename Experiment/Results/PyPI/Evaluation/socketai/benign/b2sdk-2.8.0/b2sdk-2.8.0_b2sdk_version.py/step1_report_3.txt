  "purpose": "Define and expose version information and user agent string for the b2sdk package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version to get package version, sys.version_info to get Python version",
  "sinks": "No sink operations that handle untrusted data; code only reads metadata and system info",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata.version -> VERSION, sys.version_info -> PYTHON_VERSION, then combined into USER_AGENT",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version info retrieval and string formatting",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info from the package metadata and system Python version info, then constructs constants for use elsewhere. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The code is purely informational and does not perform any operations that could be malicious. It relies on standard library functions in a safe manner. No suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe, and standard version information module with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
