  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review & Logic Confirmation:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a straightforward `__init__.py` file that imports a version module (`b2sdk.version`) and assigns its `VERSION` attribute to the `__version__` variable.\n   - Each report confirms that there are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output handling, no external data sources, and no suspicious code.\n   - The `assert __version__` statement is a simple check to ensure the version string is set, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a minimal package initialization script with no malicious intent.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n4. **Risk & Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code only imports a version string and assigns it, with no external inputs, no network calls, no code execution, and no data manipulation, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would imply malicious intent or potential security issues, which are not present here.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless package initialization script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Based on this review, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely boilerplate, with no malicious or risky behavior.",
