  "purpose": "Initialize the b2sdk package by setting the version information.",
  "sources": "Importing the b2sdk.version module and accessing its VERSION attribute.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data processing or external output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Importing version info from b2sdk.version and assigning it to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The assert statement simply ensures __version__ is set.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version module from the same package and assigns the version to __version__. The assert statement is a basic check to ensure __version__ is not empty. No external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive functions are present. The code serves as a standard package initializer without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It only sets up version info for the package.",
