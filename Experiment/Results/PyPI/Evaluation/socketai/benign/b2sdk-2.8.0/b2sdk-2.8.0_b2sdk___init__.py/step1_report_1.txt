  "purpose": "Initialize the b2sdk module by setting its version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing b2sdk.version and the assignment of __version__ from b2sdk.version.VERSION.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __version__ does not involve untrusted data; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "The imported version information flows directly into __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a version module from the package and sets the __version__ variable accordingly. It includes an assertion to ensure __version__ is defined. The code is straightforward, with no input/output handling, no data from external sources, and no suspicious behaviors. The license and copyright comments are standard, and no malicious or security risk behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple module initializer setting version info with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
