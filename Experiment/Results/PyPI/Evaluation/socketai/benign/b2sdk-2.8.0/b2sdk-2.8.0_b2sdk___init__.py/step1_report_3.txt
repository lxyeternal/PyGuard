  "purpose": "This code initializes the b2sdk package, setting its version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from the b2sdk.version module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The version is imported and assigned to __version__, with an assertion to verify its presence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present; the code is straightforward package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version module, assigns a version string to __version__, and asserts its existence. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident. The structure is standard for a package __init__.py file, focusing solely on setting package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package initialization with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
