{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the package by importing the version module and setting the __version__ variable, ensuring the version string is present.",
  "sources": "Importing b2sdk.version and accessing b2sdk.version.VERSION",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import of version module -> assignment to __version__ -> assertion check",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and assignment with a simple assertion",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py that imports a version attribute and assigns it to __version__, asserting its presence. No dynamic code, input/output, or suspicious patterns are present. The assertion is a standard check. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is typical for package initialization, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
