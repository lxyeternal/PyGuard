  "purpose": "Initialize the b2sdk package and set version information",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__ annotations and b2sdk.version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies, just imports and a version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations from __future__, then imports the version module of b2sdk. It sets the __version__ variable to the version from b2sdk.version.VERSION, then asserts its presence. The code is straightforward, serves initialization purposes, and contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply sets the package version and performs a basic assertion.",
