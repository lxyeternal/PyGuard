  "purpose": "Initialize the b2sdk package and set version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements: `from __future__ import annotations` and `import b2sdk.version`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports and assigns version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and variable assignment. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature and a version module, then sets a version variable and asserts its existence. There are no user inputs, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling. The assertion is a standard check for version presence. The code appears to be standard initialization code for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package initialization script that imports a version number and verifies its existence. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and is a typical pattern in Python packages. No security concerns are present.",
