{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module for the SDK, importing internal components, setting up logging filters, and mapping external interfaces to internal implementations.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules, constants, and configuration functions; no dynamic data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, output, or external communication; purely import and configuration code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and logging setup.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; the logging filter is benign and for warning suppression.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK initialization script, importing various internal modules, setting up logging filters, and mapping interfaces. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or very close) are accurate and appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is safe and poses no threat to the system or supply chain integrity.",
