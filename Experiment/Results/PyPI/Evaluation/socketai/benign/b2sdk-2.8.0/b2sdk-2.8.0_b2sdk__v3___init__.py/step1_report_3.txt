{
  "purpose": "This file primarily acts as an initializer and importer of various internal modules within the b2sdk package, establishing interfaces and configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, configuration setups, and utility functions. No direct data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks are evident. No external network, file, or system command execution is directly invoked.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data propagation paths are observable within this file.",
  "anomalies": "The code mainly consists of import statements, logger configuration, and module mapping. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The file is a standard module initialization script that sets up logging, filters, and maps internal modules and classes for the b2sdk package. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network communication directly. All operations are import and configuration related, which are typical and benign. No signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injections are present. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign initialization and import script for the b2sdk package. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The module's purpose is to organize internal imports and configure logging. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
