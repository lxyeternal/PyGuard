{
  "purpose": "This file primarily manages the import and export of various exception classes and functions related to error handling within the Backblaze B2 SDK, facilitating structured error management across the SDK modules.",
  "sources": "The code imports exception classes and functions from internal modules (b2sdk._internal.*) and defines the __all__ list for exports. It does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data, system commands, or external communication within this code segment.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is limited to importing modules and defining exports; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code consists solely of import statements and an export list; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The file imports various exception classes from internal modules and consolidates them into an __all__ list for external use. This is standard practice in Python for defining module exports. No data processing, input handling, or external communication occurs here. The code is static and straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module for managing exception class exports within the SDK. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It functions solely as an import/export facilitator without executing untrusted code or external data handling.",
