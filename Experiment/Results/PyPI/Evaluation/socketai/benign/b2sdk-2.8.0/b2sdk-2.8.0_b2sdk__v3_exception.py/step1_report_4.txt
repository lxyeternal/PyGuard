  "purpose": "This module imports and exposes various exception classes from internal packages related to the B2 SDK, scan, and sync components, for use in error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "Imports of exception classes from internal modules, which are standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data input, user input, or untrusted data sources are processed or used as sinks within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sinks; this code mainly aggregates exception classes for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code solely manages imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and aggregation of exception classes for module exports. No logic, data processing, or untrusted data handling occurs. The code structure is simple, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It adheres to standard Python module patterns for defining public API via __all__.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply consolidates exception class exports for a larger SDK package. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
