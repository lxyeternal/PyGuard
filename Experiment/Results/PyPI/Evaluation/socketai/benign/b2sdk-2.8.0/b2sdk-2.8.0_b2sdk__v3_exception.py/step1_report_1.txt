{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports exception classes for the Backblaze B2 SDK, consolidating various error types and internal exceptions for use throughout the SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal exception modules and definitions of exception class exports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; the code primarily imports and exports exception classes without handling external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the module serves as an exception registry.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs detected. The code strictly follows standard Python module conventions for exception handling and does not include any dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various exception classes from internal modules and declares an __all__ list for exporting these classes. The structure is consistent with a module that consolidates exception definitions for SDK error handling. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. All imports and exports appear legitimate and aligned with standard SDK exception management practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK exception registry module with no malicious intent or security risks. It only consolidates exception classes for internal and external use within the SDK. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
