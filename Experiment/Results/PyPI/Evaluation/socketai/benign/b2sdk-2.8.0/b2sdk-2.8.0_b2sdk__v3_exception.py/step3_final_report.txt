{
  "purpose": "This code consolidates and re-exports exception classes used within the SDK, serving as a centralized exception registry for consistent error handling.",
  "sources": "The code imports exception classes and functions from internal modules, with no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data transmissions; the module only re-exports classes for internal use.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The module imports exception classes from internal SDK modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, network or file operations, or obfuscation. The purpose is purely organizational, facilitating exception handling across the SDK. The code's static nature and lack of external interactions indicate it is benign and free from malicious intent. No anomalies or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign exception registry module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All evidence points to it being a straightforward organizational component of the SDK.",
