{
  "purpose": "This file imports and re-exports various exception classes from internal modules for use in the B2 SDK, providing a centralized set of error types.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and specific exception classes from internal packages within the b2sdk library.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no code execution, or data leak points present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code solely consists of import and export statements without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard for organizing exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numerous exception classes from internal modules, likely to be used throughout the SDK for error handling. All imported items are exception classes or functions related to error processing. The code only re-exports these classes via the __all__ list for external use, with no dynamic execution, network access, or data handling observed. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The structure indicates a typical module for managing exception types, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard exception aggregation module for the Backblaze B2 SDK, with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected. It simply organizes and exposes internal exception classes for use elsewhere.",
