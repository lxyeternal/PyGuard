{
  "purpose": "Defines a collection of geographic projection configurations using the Bunch data structure, including parameters such as projection definitions, origins, resolutions, and bounds.",
  "sources": "The code imports Bunch from traitlets.utils.bunch and initializes the projections data structure directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code solely defines static data structures.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to the construction of nested Bunch objects containing static projection parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The data appears to be static configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a utility class and creates a complex nested data structure to store geographic projection settings. All data is hardcoded with descriptive parameters, including projection definitions, origins, resolutions, and bounds, with no evidence of dynamic input, network activity, or malicious code. The data structure seems to be intended for geographic mapping or spatial computations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior. The code’s purpose appears purely functional and configuration-related.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration setup for geographic projections with no malicious intent or security concerns. It solely defines data parameters for use elsewhere. No indicators of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
