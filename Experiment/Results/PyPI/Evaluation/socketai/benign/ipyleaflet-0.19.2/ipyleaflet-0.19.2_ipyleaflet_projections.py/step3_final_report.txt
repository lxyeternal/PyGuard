  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining geographic projections and coordinate systems for GIS applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded dictionaries and nested Bunch objects, defining projection parameters, bounds, origins, and resolutions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data. It solely initializes static data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only constructs in-memory data objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard proj4def strings, well-structured data, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is static configuration data for geographic projections, using standard proj4 strings and well-formed nested data structures. No dynamic code, external data access, or network activity is present. The data appears consistent and typical for GIS setups. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward static data and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static GIS configuration data with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the analysis confirms the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
