  "purpose": "Defines and provides access to XYZ tile provider basemaps from the xyzservices library for mapping applications.",
  "sources": "Imports xyzservices.providers as basemaps, and includes comments and documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and contains standard comments and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library (xyzservices.providers) and documents its use for providing basemap tiles. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely informational and setup code for a mapping package. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module for setting up basemap providers. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
