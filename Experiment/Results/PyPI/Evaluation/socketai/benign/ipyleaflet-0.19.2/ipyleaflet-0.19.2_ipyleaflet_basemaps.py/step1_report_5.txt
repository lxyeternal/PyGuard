  "purpose": "Define and import XYZ tile provider basemaps for use in mapping applications.",
  "sources": "Import statement: import xyzservices.providers as basemaps",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statement loads a library but does not process data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with comments and an import statement",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily documentation and an import statement for a well-known open-source library. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execution of untrusted code. The import is static and from a reputable source (xyzservices). There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The comments clarify purpose and usage, and the code adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to set up map basemaps from an open-source library without any malicious intent or security risks.",
