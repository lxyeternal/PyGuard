  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the details.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a simple import of `xyzservices.providers` with documentation.\n- No data processing, user input, network activity, or output operations are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The import is from a reputable, open-source library, and the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; it imports a known module and contains only documentation. No issues or discrepancies are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports indicate any malicious behavior. The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree there's no obfuscation; obfuscated score is 0.\n- **Security risk:** Since the code only imports a library without processing untrusted data or performing external operations, the security risk is correctly scored as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scoring:\n- The **confidence** score is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The **malware** score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated** score is 0, matching the clear and standard code.\n- The **securityRisk** score is 0, which is justified.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports are very consistent and conservative, which is appropriate. There are no assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what is evident.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores; they seem reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur with the provided scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with these, considering the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with documentation.\n- No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code poses no security risk.",
