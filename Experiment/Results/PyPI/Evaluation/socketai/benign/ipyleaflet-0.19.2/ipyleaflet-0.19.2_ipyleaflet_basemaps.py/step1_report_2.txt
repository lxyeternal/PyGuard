{
  "purpose": "Defines a module that imports and documents XYZ tile providers for mapping purposes, specifically from the xyzservices library.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'import xyzservices.providers as basemaps'. The import reads the xyzservices.providers module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform operations that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module and provides documentation and usage example; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard for module documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a third-party library (xyzservices.providers) and contains docstrings explaining its purpose and usage. There are no user inputs, network operations, or data manipulations. The import is standard for the purpose of using predefined map tile providers. No obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for defining basemaps with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It solely imports a known library and provides documentation.",
