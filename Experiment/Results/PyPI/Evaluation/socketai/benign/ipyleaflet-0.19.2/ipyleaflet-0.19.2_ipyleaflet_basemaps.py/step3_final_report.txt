  "sources": "Import statement importing xyzservices.providers as basemaps.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external communications.",
  "flows": "Import statement; no data flow from sources to sinks; static code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward import and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static import of a reputable open-source library with accompanying documentation. No dynamic execution, user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. All reports agree on its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence score is high (1), given the simplicity and transparency of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely informational and setup for geospatial basemaps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
