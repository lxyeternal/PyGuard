  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, data flows, potential vulnerabilities, and whether the assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines classes and functions for interactive maps in Jupyter, mainly managing widget states, message passing, and user events. No external network connections, file writes, or command executions are observed. Message passing (self.send()) is used for frontend communication, typical for widgets.\n\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk Scores:** The report assigns malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.1. These are reasonable; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on data handling via external libraries (shapely, geopandas). No network or file write operations beyond reading WKT files, which are properly handled with error checks. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. These are reasonable; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate GIS widget code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on widget communication, data updates, and event handling. No external network activity or malicious code. Uses standard message passing and callbacks. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. These are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, open-source GIS widget code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed class structures, data flows, and external library usage. No malicious network activity or code injection. File operations are handled with exception handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2. Slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable given the external resource loading (e.g., WKT files, images). No malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Open-source GIS visualization code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data flows from user interactions, external data sources, and widget properties. No embedded malicious code or network activity. External URLs are configurable, which could be misused if controlled externally, but no malicious URLs are embedded.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. These are reasonable.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Typical widget data handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the analysis. No code patterns or behaviors suggest malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.1 in some cases, but still low, given the nature of the code (map visualization, message passing). The only potential concern is external resource URLs, but they are configurable and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 across all reports. No obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Considering the code's purpose and the absence of malicious activity, a risk score of around **0.1** is appropriate.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the overall low security risk, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code analysis. The code is a legitimate, well-structured open-source mapping library with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
