  "purpose": "Minimal setup invocation for Python packaging using dynamic import of setuptools and calling setup()",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'setuptools' via __import__('setuptools')",
  "sinks": "Call to setup() function, which can modify environment or install dependencies",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' leads to execution of setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string literal is unconventional but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward dynamic import of 'setuptools' and calls setup(), typical in setup.py files. No external input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The use of __import__ is unusual but not malicious. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging. The security risk is negligible, and the code does not pose any threat.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated activity. The use of __import__ does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is effectively zero, and the code is safe for use.",
