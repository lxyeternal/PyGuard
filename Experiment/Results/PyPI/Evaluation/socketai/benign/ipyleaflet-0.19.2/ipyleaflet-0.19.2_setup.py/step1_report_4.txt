  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ to dynamically import 'setuptools' instead of a static import; no further code execution or data flow shown",
  "analysis": "The code performs a dynamic import of the 'setuptools' module using __import__, then calls setup(). This is a standard approach for package setup scripts, though using __import__ is less common than a static import. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution is evident. The setup() call is incomplete, but this alone is not suspicious or malicious. The code is minimal and typical of package setup scripts, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal setup script that dynamically imports setuptools and calls setup(). No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The use of __import__ is unusual but not malicious. Overall, this code appears benign and typical for a Python package setup.",
