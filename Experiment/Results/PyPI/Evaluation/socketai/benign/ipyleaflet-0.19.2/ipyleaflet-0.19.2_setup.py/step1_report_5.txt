  "purpose": "Invoke the setuptools library to set up a Python package",
  "sources": "The import statement (__import__('setuptools'))",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call from setuptools",
  "flows": "Importing setuptools then calling setup() to configure the package",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for package setup",
  "analysis": "The code performs a dynamic import of the 'setuptools' module and immediately calls its setup() function. This pattern is common in Python package setup scripts (setup.py). There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The use of __import__() is standard in some dynamic import scenarios. No data flow from untrusted sources is present, and there are no dangerous operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup invocation with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It appears to be a standard setup script.",
