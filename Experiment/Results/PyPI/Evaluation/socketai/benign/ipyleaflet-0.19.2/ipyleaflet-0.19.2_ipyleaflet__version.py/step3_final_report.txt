  "purpose": "Declare version information for the Jupyter extension package.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned for version strings, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward variable assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is simple, comments, and version constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and two variable assignments defining version strings. There are no input handling, data processing, external interactions, or obfuscation. The code is typical for package metadata declaration, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
