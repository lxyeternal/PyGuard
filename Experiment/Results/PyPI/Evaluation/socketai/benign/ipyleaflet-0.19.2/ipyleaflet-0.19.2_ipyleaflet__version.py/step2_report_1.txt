  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of straightforward variable assignments for versioning, with no input handling, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code snippets are benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The code snippets are simple and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - Given the benign nature of the code, these scores are appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports correctly assign zero risk, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n   - The code is clearly non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and poses no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n   - The code contains no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis and factual observations.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The uniformity across reports supports their accuracy.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is purely declarative, setting version variables with no malicious intent.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
