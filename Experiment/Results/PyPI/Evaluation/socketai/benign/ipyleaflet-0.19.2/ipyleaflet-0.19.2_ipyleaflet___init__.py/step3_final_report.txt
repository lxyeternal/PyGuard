  "purpose": "Initialize package components and enable Google Colab widget support if applicable.",
  "sources": "sys.modules for environment detection, import statements for version, leaflet, basemaps, and google.colab.output if in Colab.",
  "sinks": "output.enable_custom_widget_manager() call, which enhances widget support in Colab.",
  "flows": "Detection of 'google.colab' in sys.modules → conditional import of output → call to output.enable_custom_widget_manager()",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from .leaflet import *`), which is common but discouraged; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and imports modules necessary for a Jupyter/Colab extension. It conditionally enables widget support in Google Colab, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present. The environment detection method and the conditional call are straightforward and documented. The assigned malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting environment-specific setup but no security threat. The code's structure and purpose are benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, environment-aware initialization script for a Jupyter extension, with standard environment detection and setup for Google Colab. No malicious or security-risk activities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
