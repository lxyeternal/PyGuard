{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package related to Jupyter Notebook extensions, likely for mapping or visualization purposes, with some specific handling for Google Colab.",
  "sources": "sys.modules to detect if 'google.colab' is imported; import statements for internal modules and version info.",
  "sinks": "The output.enable_custom_widget_manager() call, which interacts with Google Colab's output module.",
  "flows": "Detection of 'google.colab' in sys.modules triggers a call to enable a custom widget manager in Colab environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code conditionally imports and calls a function based on environment detection, which is typical for environment-specific configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and modules related to mapping functionalities. It then checks if the environment is Google Colab by inspecting sys.modules. If so, it imports the 'output' module from google.colab and enables the custom widget manager, which is a standard procedure for customizing widget behavior in Colab. There are no indications of malicious activity, data leaks, or malicious code. The code’s structure and content are consistent with legitimate package setup and environment adaptation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Jupyter Notebook extension with specific handling for Google Colab environments. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
