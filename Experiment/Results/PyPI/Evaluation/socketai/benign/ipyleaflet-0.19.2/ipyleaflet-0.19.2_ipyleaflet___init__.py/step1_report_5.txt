{
  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize a Python package or module, importing version info, leaflet, basemaps, and enabling Google Colab custom widgets if running in Colab environment.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.modules to detect Google Colab environment; importing internal version, leaflet, basemaps modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing output.enable_custom_widget_manager() if in Colab environment.",
  "flows": "If 'google.colab' is in sys.modules, the code imports and calls output.enable_custom_widget_manager(), which interacts with the Google Colab environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of dynamic environment detection and conditional import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata and components, then conditionally interacts with Google Colab to enable custom widgets. No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. The import statements and environment check are common in open-source packages intended for multiple environments. The call to output.enable_custom_widget_manager() is standard for enabling features in Google Colab and does not suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical initialization snippet for a package supporting Jupyter and Google Colab environments. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks identified.",
