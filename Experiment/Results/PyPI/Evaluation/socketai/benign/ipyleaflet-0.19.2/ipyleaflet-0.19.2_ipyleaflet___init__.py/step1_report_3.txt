{
  "purpose": "To initialize and configure a Jupyter notebook extension, including loading version info and map-related modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements, specifically the module version, leaflet, basemaps, and conditional Google Colab output module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the `output.enable_custom_widget_manager()` call if it interacts with Google Colab's environment unexpectedly.",
  "flows": "Importing modules (version, leaflet, basemaps) -> checking sys.modules for 'google.colab' -> possibly enabling custom widget manager in Colab.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; the only conditional behavior is enabling a widget manager in Colab. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports necessary modules and conditionally enables a Google Colab feature if detected. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The conditional import and function call are standard practices for environment-specific configurations. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign initialization script for a Jupyter extension, with environment-specific adjustment for Google Colab. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
