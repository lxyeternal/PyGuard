{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python package, importing version info and modules, and enables Google Colab widget support if detected.",
  "sources": "sys.modules to check for 'google.colab' and import statements for package modules and 'output' from 'google.colab'.",
  "sinks": "The conditional import and method call 'output.enable_custom_widget_manager()' could be a sink if 'output' or the method is maliciously altered.",
  "flows": "If 'google.colab' is in sys.modules, the code imports 'output' and calls 'enable_custom_widget_manager()', which could be an untrusted flow if 'output' is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with standard imports and a conditional operation for Google Colab; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation. The use of 'output.enable_custom_widget_manager()' is context-dependent but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for Google Colab environment and conditionally imports 'output' to enable custom widget management, which is a common practice for enhancing Jupyter notebooks' interactivity. No suspicious or malicious code is detected; the operations are typical for such environments. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present. The only potential concern is reliance on the 'google.colab' environment, which is standard but could be exploited if 'output' were compromised, though this is unlikely here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and is standard for a package supporting Google Colab environments. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified based on this code snippet.",
