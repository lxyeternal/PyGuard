{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and imports components of a Jupyter notebook extension or widget library, possibly for mapping or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.modules to detect if running in Google Colab, imports version info, leaflets, and basemaps modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the sys.modules check and the call to output.enable_custom_widget_manager() could influence environment behavior, but no direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Detects if 'google.colab' is present in sys.modules, then conditionally imports and enables a widget manager, which could influence the environment within Colab.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses wildcard import (*.leaflet), which is often discouraged as it can obscure imported symbols, but this is common in package initialization. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment detection (Colab), imports version info, and module components necessary for the library. The conditional import and environment-specific activation suggest standard practice for extending or configuring notebook widgets. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The wildcard import may be considered a minor code quality issue but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization for a Jupyter widget library with environment-specific behavior for Google Colab. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
