  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for converting geospatial velocity datasets into JSON format. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's purpose and implementation."
