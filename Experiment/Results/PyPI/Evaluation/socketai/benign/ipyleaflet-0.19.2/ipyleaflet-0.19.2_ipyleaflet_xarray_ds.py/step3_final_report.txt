  "purpose": "Convert velocity datasets into a structured JSON format with grid specifications for visualization or further processing.",
  "sources": "Dataset variables 'u_var' and 'v_var', dataset attributes, dataset coordinate values (latitude and longitude).",
  "sinks": "None external; data is processed internally and returned as a JSON-compatible Python object.",
  "flows": "Dataset variables are validated and filled; units are checked; latitude may be reversed; grid parameters are computed; data is flattened and assembled into JSON structure.",
  "anomalies": "Static 'refTime' string used as metadata; no dynamic timestamp or external data sinks; no obfuscation or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of dataset dimensions, replaces NaNs with zeros, checks units consistency, reverses latitude if ordered ascending, computes grid spacing, and constructs a JSON structure with headers and flattened velocity data. No external communication, code obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The static 'refTime' is typical metadata. The code is well-structured and aligns with common data processing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for converting geospatial velocity datasets into JSON format. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
