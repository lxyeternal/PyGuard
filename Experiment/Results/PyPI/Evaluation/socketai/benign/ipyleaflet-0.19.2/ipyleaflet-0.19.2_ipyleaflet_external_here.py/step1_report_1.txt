  "purpose": "Define and import HERE basemaps for mapping visualization using xyzservices and ipyleaflet.",
  "sources": "Import statements: traitlets.Bunch, ipyleaflet.basemap_to_tiles, xyzservices.providers as xyz.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code primarily sets up variables for use elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Import xyzproviders, assign xyz.HERE and xyz.HEREv3 to a Bunch object named basemaps.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries for map visualization, references external resources, and defines a Bunch containing two HERE map providers. No data is read from external sources at runtime, no untrusted inputs are processed, and no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. It appears to be a typical setup for map layers in a Jupyter environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign setup for mapping layers, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
