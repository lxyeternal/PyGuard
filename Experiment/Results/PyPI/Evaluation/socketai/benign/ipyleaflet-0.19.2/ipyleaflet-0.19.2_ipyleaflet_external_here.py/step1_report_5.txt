  "purpose": "Defines and exports HERE basemaps using xyzservices providers for use in map visualizations.",
  "sources": "Imports traitlets.Bunch, ipyleaflet.basemap_to_tiles, and xyzservices.providers as xyz.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; static data referencing external providers.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to define a Bunch with references to external provider data; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a Bunch object with references to predefined provider data. It does not perform any network communication, data processing, or user input handling. The imported modules are standard for map visualization and provider referencing. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple, benign configuration defining map basemaps using publicly available providers. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
