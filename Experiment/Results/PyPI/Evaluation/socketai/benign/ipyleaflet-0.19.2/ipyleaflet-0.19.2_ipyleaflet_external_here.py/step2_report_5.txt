  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing standard libraries and assigning references to map providers.\n   - There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code does not perform any network communication, user input handling, or data processing at runtime.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with no issues or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the code as simple configuration/setup.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - No mention of overlooked vulnerabilities, such as dependency supply chain risks, but given the simplicity, these are minimal.\n   - **Conclusion:** No significant errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely static configuration with no runtime vulnerabilities.\n   - No malicious activity, no data leaks, no external command execution.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign malware score 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious code, no suspicious behavior detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is correctly assigned.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (benign configuration code)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the nature of the code, even considering supply chain risks, the actual code snippet itself is safe.\n- However, dependency supply chain risks (e.g., compromised `xyzservices` or `ipyleaflet`) are outside the scope of this snippet but should be monitored separately.\n\n**In conclusion, the reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.**",
