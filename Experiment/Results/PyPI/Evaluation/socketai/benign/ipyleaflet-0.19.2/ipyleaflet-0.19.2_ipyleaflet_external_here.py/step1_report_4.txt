  "purpose": "Define and provide access to HERE basemaps for mapping purposes within a Jupyter environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements: traitlets.Bunch, ipyleaflet.basemap_to_tiles, xyzservices.providers as xyz",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or output in an insecure manner",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code imports modules and assigns predefined provider objects to a variable",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a third-party module for geospatial visualization. It references a known open-source repository for map providers. It assigns two provider objects to a collection for use in mapping. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or insecure coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for map basemaps in a Jupyter environment, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
