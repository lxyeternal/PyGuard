  "purpose": "Define HERE basemaps for use with ipyleaflet, referencing external providers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for traitlets, ipyleaflet, and xyzservices; assignment of xyz.HERE and xyz.HEREv3 to a Bunch.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no output or network transmission in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static, and the code only assigns references.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. External dependencies are standard for mapping tools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python libraries and third-party mapping modules. It defines a Bunch object with references to map providers from xyzservices. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling present. No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The code appears to be straightforward configuration/setup for map layers.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that defines map basemaps using external libraries. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
