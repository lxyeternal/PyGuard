  "purpose": "Define HERE map basemaps using xyzservices for visualization in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Imports from traitlets, ipyleaflet, and xyzservices; references to xyz.HERE and xyz.HEREv3.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; references are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Assigns xyz.HERE and xyz.HEREv3 to a Bunch object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard geospatial libraries and assigns references to external map providers without performing any runtime data processing, network activity, or user input handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code serves as a configuration module for map visualization. External dependencies are well-known open-source packages. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the thorough analysis and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration module for map providers with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
