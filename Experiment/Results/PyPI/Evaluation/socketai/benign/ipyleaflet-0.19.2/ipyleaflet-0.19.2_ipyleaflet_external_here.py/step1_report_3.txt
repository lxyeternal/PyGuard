  "purpose": "Define and expose HERE basemaps for mapping purposes using the xyzservices providers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for traitlets.Bunch, ipyleaflet.basemap_to_tiles, and xyzservices.providers as xyz.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; the code primarily imports modules and assigns variables.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code is straightforward and documentation references an external repository.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for mapping and defines a simple data structure (Bunch) to hold specific map providers from xyzservices. It does not perform any data processing, network calls, or user input handling. The imported modules are standard for geospatial mapping tasks. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module that defines references to HERE map providers for use in mapping applications. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
