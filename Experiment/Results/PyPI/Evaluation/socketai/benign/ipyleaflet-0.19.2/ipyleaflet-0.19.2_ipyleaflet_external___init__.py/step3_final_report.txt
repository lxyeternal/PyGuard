  "purpose": "Analyze supply chain security of the open source dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks within the code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), complex control flow, obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of untrusted code, data leakage through environment variables, hidden malicious payloads via obfuscation.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) potentially leading to eval/exec execution, obfuscated variables concealing malicious logic.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, complex control flow, misleading variable names, absence of explicit malicious payloads but suspicious techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques, which are common indicators of malicious intent but not definitive alone. The use of eval/exec and complex control flow suggest potential concealment of malicious payloads. The absence of explicit malicious actions reduces certainty, but the suspicion warrants cautious scoring. The benign reports lack such obfuscation, aligning with low risk. The primary concern is Report 3, where obfuscation and dynamic execution justify a higher malware suspicion. Adjustments to scores reflect this, with malware increased to 0.4 and security risk to 0.5, aligning with the suspicion level.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with appropriate scores. Report 3's obfuscation and dynamic code execution justify a moderate suspicion level, warranting slightly higher malware and security risk scores. Static analysis suggests no confirmed malicious payloads, but the techniques used are suspicious enough to warrant caution.",
