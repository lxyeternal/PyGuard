{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming HTTP requests, potentially serving as an API or web application component.",
  "sources": "User input via HTTP requests, environment variables for configuration, potentially external modules or files read during import or execution.",
  "sinks": "Response output to clients, system commands executed, network communication for data transmission, environment variables potentially exposing sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests or environment variables is processed and may be sent back in responses or used in system calls, leading to potential data leaks or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or secret keys. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variables detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a web server, handles requests, and uses standard modules. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. The functions are typical for a web app. Environment variables are used for configuration but not exposed insecurely. No external network connections to suspicious domains are observed. The code does not execute untrusted input directly as code or perform insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard web server implementation with no suspicious or malicious features.",
