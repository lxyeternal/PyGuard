{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for DataPolicyService, facilitating gRPC and async gRPC transports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, dictionary assignment, and the list of exported classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources; code mainly sets up registry and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport types, and exposes these classes for external use. There are no indications of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The license header and comments indicate standard open-source practices. All elements appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup module for transport class registration, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
