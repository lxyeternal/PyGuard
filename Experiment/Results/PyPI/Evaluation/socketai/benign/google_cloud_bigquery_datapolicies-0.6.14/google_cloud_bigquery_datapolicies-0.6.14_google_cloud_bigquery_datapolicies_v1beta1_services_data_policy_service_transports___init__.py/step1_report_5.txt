  "purpose": "Define and register different transport classes for DataPolicyService in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes, dictionary assignment for transport registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and registry assignment are static; no flow of untrusted data to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local modules, then creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The registry is a static mapping without dynamic or insecure operations. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a client library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for a Python client library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply registers transport classes for internal use.",
