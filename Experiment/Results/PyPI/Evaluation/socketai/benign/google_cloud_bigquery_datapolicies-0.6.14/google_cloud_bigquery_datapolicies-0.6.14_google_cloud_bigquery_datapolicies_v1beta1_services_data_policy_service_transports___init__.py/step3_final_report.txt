  "purpose": "Register transport classes for the DataPolicyService in a Python client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for transport classes; creation of an ordered registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static class references only.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted inputs; static registration process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated patterns. The license header and structure are standard. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely static and intended for dependency registration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for registering transport classes with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring aligns with this assessment.",
