{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers transport classes for a Data Policy Service, facilitating different communication methods (gRPC and gRPC AsyncIO).",
  "sources": "Imports from collections, typing, and local modules; assignment of transport classes to a registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up class registry mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python libraries and local modules, then creates a registry dictionary mapping string keys to transport classes. It includes licensing comments but no runtime data processing, user input handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module for registering transport classes with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data processing or external communications. The code appears safe and normal.",
