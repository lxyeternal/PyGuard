{
  "purpose": "This code defines a registry of transport classes for a data policy service, facilitating the selection of different transport mechanisms (gRPC, gRPC asynchronous).",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes, and initializes a registry dictionary with transport class references.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to critical operations, as the code primarily sets up class references.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are present; the code assigns class references to a registry for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes a registry dictionary, and populates it with transport class references. It also defines the __all__ variable for exports. There is no user input, external data handling, or dynamic execution. The structure and content are typical for a Python module setting up dependency injection or plugin registry. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a transport registry in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as an internal configuration component.",
