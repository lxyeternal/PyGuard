{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and register different transport classes for a data policy service, facilitating transport selection for a client library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (collections, typing, and local modules). No user input or external data sources are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources; no network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a registry dictionary and populates it with class references, without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, consisting of class imports, registry creation, and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and local classes for transport mechanisms. It creates an ordered registry dictionary to map string keys to transport classes, then populates it with two entries: gRPC and gRPC asynchronous transports. It concludes by defining an __all__ variable to specify exported symbols. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration or setup module for a client library, registering transport classes for later use. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
