  "purpose": "This code is for importing and setting up clients and request types for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies API, likely used for managing data policies in a cloud environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.bigquery_datapolicies_v1beta1 and local modules for service clients and data policy types.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no functions that process external input or output data in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and assigns version info; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. All elements are standard for a Python client library setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard library import and setup script for Google Cloud's BigQuery Data Policies API. It imports version info, service clients, and request types, and defines module exports. No external input processing, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or obfuscation, and uses standard Python import patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies API client and request types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is safe to use as part of a larger application that manages data policies.",
