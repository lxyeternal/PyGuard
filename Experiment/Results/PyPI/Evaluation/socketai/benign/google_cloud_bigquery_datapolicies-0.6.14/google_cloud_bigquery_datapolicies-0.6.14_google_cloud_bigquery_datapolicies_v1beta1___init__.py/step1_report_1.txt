  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module that imports and exposes classes and constants related to Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies, likely for use in managing data policies via client APIs.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.bigquery_datapolicies_v1beta1 and relative module imports within the package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or outputs; primarily imports and exports of classes and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code mainly sets up module exports and versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected; license headers are standard and informational.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module for a client library, importing specific classes and constants for interacting with Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies. It defines versioning and exports for API client classes and request/response types. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The structure and content are consistent with typical SDK modules. No external inputs or data handling are present beyond module imports and definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious SDK module setup for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided content.",
