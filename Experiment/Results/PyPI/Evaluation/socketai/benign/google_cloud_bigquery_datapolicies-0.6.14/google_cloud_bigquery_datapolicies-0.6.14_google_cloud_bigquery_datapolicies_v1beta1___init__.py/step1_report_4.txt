  "purpose": "This code appears to define a Python package module for interacting with Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies via client classes and data types.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.bigquery_datapolicies_v1beta1 and local module files for service and data types.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or output data; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No input processing or data flow paths; the code mainly imports modules and defines package exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious logic. The licensing comments are standard. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily an API client module setup for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies. It imports specific classes and functions, sets the module version, and defines exports. No input/output handling, no dynamic execution, no network activity, or data manipulation logic present. The code structure is standard for SDK modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It seems to serve as a straightforward interface for cloud API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard client library module setup for Google Cloud's BigQuery Data Policies. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as a typical SDK interface without any suspicious or malicious components.",
