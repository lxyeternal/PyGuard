{
  "purpose": "This code sets up imports and module metadata for a Google Cloud BigQuery data policy client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.bigquery_datapolicies_v1beta1 and local service and type modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports and defines module exports",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from input to sink; code primarily imports modules and assigns variables",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; standard licensing comments; no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script mainly imports modules, defines a version variable, and exports classes and request types related to Google Cloud BigQuery data policies. The license information and standard package structure are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The code appears to be part of an SDK or client library setup, which is common and expected for such packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a client library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs no sensitive operations and only manages module imports and exports.",
