{
  "purpose": "This code sets up import statements and exports for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies SDK classes and types, facilitating client interactions with data policies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external modules, including version info, client classes, and data type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or handle user input.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; primarily static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard license headers, imports, and export definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK module that imports necessary classes and constants, sets version info, and defines module exports. It contains no dynamic behavior, data processing, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The structure is typical for client library setup code, with no suspicious patterns or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies SDK. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated content, and is consistent with safe SDK practices.",
