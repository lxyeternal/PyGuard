  "purpose": "This code is for importing and exposing the DataPolicyServiceClient and DataPolicyServiceAsyncClient classes, likely for a Python package related to data policy management.",
  "sources": "Import statements for async_client and client modules",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only handles module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; only standard import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard licensing comments, import statements for specific client classes, and an __all__ definition for module exports. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a typical module interface for a Python client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for client class exports with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
