{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to import client classes for a data policy service, likely for use in managing data policies in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause security issues",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; simply imports classes and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns observed; the code appears standard and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules related to async and sync data policy clients, then defines __all__ for module exports. There are no input sources, no processing or handling of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, or any signs of malicious behavior. The code is typical for Python module structure, with proper licensing comments and straightforward imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module setup for a data policy client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
