{
  "purpose": "This code provides module imports and exports for DataPolicyService client classes, likely for use in a larger system interacting with data policies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .async_client and .client.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or user input. No network, file, or environment variable operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, import statements, and an __all__ declaration. There are no input or data reading operations, no execution of dynamic or malicious code, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be a straightforward module defining client classes for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exporting client classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python package component.",
