{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific client classes from local modules and re-exports them for external use, acting as a simple interface or facade.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client). It does not process external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports client classes and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. The structure is typical for a client library interface. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard boilerplate module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation suitable for public distribution.",
