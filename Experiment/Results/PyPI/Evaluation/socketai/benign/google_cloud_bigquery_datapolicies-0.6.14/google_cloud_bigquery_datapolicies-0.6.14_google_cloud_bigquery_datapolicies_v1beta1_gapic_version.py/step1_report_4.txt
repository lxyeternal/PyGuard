  "purpose": "This code appears to set metadata information such as licensing, versioning, and licensing notices for a Python module.",
  "sources": "Commented license and copyright notices, version assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or code execution observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and informational",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; standard license header and version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a version variable assignment, which are typical in open-source modules. No dynamic code, user input, or data processing is present. The license information and version string are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard header and version declaration for an open-source Python module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
