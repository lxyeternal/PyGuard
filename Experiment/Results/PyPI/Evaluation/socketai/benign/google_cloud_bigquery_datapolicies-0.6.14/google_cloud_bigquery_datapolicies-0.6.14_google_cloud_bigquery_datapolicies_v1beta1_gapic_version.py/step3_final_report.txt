  "purpose": "Metadata header containing licensing comments and version information for an open-source Python package.",
  "sources": "Static comments and the assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign metadata. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign header with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, metadata-only content.",
