  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Content**: All reports correctly identify that the provided code snippet is purely metadata—license comments and a version variable assignment. There are no functions, imports, data processing, or external interactions. The code is static and contains no executable logic.\n\n2. **Malicious Indicators & Anomalies**: Each report notes the absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or embedded scripts. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable comments and code.\n   - **Security Risk & Overall Risk**: All assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly interpret the code as benign metadata.\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is only metadata, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own evaluation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet provided. The code is benign, standard licensing, and version declaration. There are no security concerns here.\n\n**Final note**: No further action needed; the code is safe.",
