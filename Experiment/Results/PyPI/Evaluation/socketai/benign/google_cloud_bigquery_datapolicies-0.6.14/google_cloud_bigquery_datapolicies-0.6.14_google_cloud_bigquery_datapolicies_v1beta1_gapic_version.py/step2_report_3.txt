  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single assignment to `__version__`.\n   - There are no functions, imports, data processing, network activity, or any executable logic.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - The code is static and purely metadata.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a benign header or metadata snippet.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are observed.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform external communication, or contain embedded scripts.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, metadata-only nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of executable or risky code.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable. No report suggests any suspicious activity or code that could be malicious.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty about benignity.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors in Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate; they do not overstate or understate the risk.\n   - They correctly identify that this is purely metadata with no security implications.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only metadata, the risk of malware or obfuscation is virtually nonexistent.\n   - The version number \"0.6.14\" does not raise any flags.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly dismiss any such concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided code snippet is a standard license header and version declaration, with no malicious or suspicious content. The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
