  "purpose": "Client library for managing Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies, providing APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving data policies with environment-based configuration and credential management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for endpoint selection, credentials, and configuration; API request methods via gRPC transport; credential info retrieval during error handling.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Google Cloud endpoints; error handling adding credential info to error details; no network connections outside official Google APIs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence endpoint and credential setup; API requests flow through wrapped methods; credential info added to errors for diagnostics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Credential info added to error details is standard for diagnostics, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated Google Cloud SDK client for BigQuery Data Policies. It uses environment variables for configuration, manages credentials securely, and performs API calls via gRPC. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious routines are present. Credential info in error details is a common debugging aid. The overall structure and logic align with best practices for SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious client library for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malware are present. The environment variable usage and credential handling follow standard, secure SDK patterns.",
