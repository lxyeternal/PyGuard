{
  "purpose": "The code provides pagers for iterating through Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies responses, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous iteration.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing), google.api_core modules, and google.cloud.bigquery_datapolicies_v1beta1.types (datapolicy). The code reads data from method calls and request/response objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to security vulnerabilities such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the method calls and request objects into response objects, which are then iterated over to yield data policies. No untrusted input processing or dangerous data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is well-structured, typical of API client pagination classes. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The retry handling and metadata passing are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements pagination classes for Google Cloud BigQuery Data Policies API, providing iterators for response pages and data policies. It carefully manages request and response objects, supports retries, and maintains metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, code injection, or data theft. All operations are limited to API request handling and iteration, with no suspicious or harmful actions observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, legitimate API client code for paginating through BigQuery Data Policies responses. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. Its structure and functionality are consistent with standard SDK practices.",
