  "purpose": "Implement classes for paginating through Google BigQuery Data Policies API responses, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous iteration.",
  "sources": "Response objects' 'data_policies' fields, request objects' 'page_token' attributes.",
  "sinks": "API request and response handling; no external or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from API responses through iteration methods, with request objects updating 'page_token' for pagination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pagination classes for API responses, utilizing standard patterns for retries, async handling, and response iteration. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, with clear request-response flow, and adheres to typical SDK design. No obfuscation or secrets are evident. The malware score is correctly zero, as there are no malicious behaviors. The security risk is minimal, given the benign nature of API response handling, warranting a score of 0.1 or lower; it can be confidently set to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of API pagination classes with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
