{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for configuring and distributing a Python package named 'google-cloud-bigquery-datapolicies'.",
  "sources": "Reading version from a local file 'gapic_version.py', reading the README file, and gathering package information via setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly handles static configuration and file reading.",
  "flows": "The version is extracted from a local file; package metadata is assembled from static data and file content; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution. The code strictly performs package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a local Python file, reads a README file for long description, and configures package setup parameters. It uses standard practices for Python package configuration with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. The dependencies are specified with version constraints, avoiding known problematic versions. There are no dynamic or unsafe code execution, no network communications, and no embedded malicious code. The structure and functions are typical of a setup.py script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration script for a Python package. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attack indicators. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file with no security concerns.",
