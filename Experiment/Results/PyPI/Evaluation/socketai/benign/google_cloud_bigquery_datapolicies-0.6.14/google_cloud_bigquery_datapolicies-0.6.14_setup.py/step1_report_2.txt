{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'google-cloud-bigquery-datapolicies' Python package, primarily to configure package metadata, dependencies, and distribution details.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'gapic_version.py', reading the README file, and importing setup-related modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are identified; the code primarily reads static files and sets up package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local Python file -> reads README content -> proceeds with package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code strictly performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads version info from a local file using regex, reads a README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with the collected metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The version parsing relies on a local file, which is safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical setup operations without any anomalous or suspicious activities.",
