  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package 'google-cloud-bigquery-datapolicies', including dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from 'gapic_version.py' file and the README from 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not write untrusted data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Version string read from a local file is assigned to a variable; README content is read and stored.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code activities, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Uses standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup routines: reading version info from a file, loading README content, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. The version extraction uses regex, which is safe here as it reads local file content. No dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious logic observed. No obfuscation, malware behavior, or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. It properly reads version and description data from local files, sets dependencies, and prepares package metadata. No anomalies or malicious intent identified.",
