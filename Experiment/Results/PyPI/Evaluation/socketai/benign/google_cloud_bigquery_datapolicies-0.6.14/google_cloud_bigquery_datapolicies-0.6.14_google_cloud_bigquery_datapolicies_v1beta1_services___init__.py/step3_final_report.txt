  "purpose": "This code snippet is a license header comment block with no executable code or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "The comment block itself, which contains licensing information and copyright notices.",
  "sinks": "There are no data flows or untrusted data sources; the code contains only comments.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the code is purely comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior are present; the snippet is standard licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward license header with no executable content, external calls, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or security-related issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license comment block with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
