{
  "purpose": "Provides a utility function to create loggers with configurable log levels, mainly for logging within a Python application.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'name' parameter for logger creation and optional 'log_level' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data into vulnerable operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input (name, log_level) -> get_logger() -> logging.getLogger() -> configured logger object",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements; straightforward logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging utility that creates and configures loggers with optional log levels. It correctly handles the logger hierarchy, sets log levels only when specified, and does not perform any unsafe operations or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code strictly manages logging configuration, which is standard practice and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe utility for setting up loggers in Python applications. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and only performs benign configuration tasks.",
