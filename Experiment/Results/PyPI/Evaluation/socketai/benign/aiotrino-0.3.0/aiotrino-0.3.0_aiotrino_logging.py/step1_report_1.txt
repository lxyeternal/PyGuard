  "purpose": "Provide a configurable logging setup for Python applications with a default logger initialization.",
  "sources": "import statements, get_logger function, usage of logging.getLogger",
  "sinks": "None present in this code; no untrusted data or output flows are evident",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines functions and initializes a logger",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward and standard for logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, defines a default log level, creates a get_logger function to instantiate loggers with optional log levels, and initializes a root logger named 'aiotrino' with INFO level. All constructs are standard for logging configuration, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. No external inputs, untrusted data, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup module with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected. It simply defines functions and initializes a logger, which is common in Python applications.",
