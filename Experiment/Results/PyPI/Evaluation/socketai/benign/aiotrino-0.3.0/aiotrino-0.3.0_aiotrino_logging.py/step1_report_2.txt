  "purpose": "Provide a configurable logging utility to obtain a logger with optional log level setting.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_logger function parameters (name and optional log_level)",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; logging setup is standard and does not involve external data or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, log_level) -> get_logger -> return logger object",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple logging configuration function that creates and returns a logger instance with optional log level configuration. It adheres to standard Python logging practices, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The default logger level is set to INFO, and no external data or environment variables are used in a risky way.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign utility for logger setup with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues.",
