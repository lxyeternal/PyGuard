{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a logger for the 'aiotrino' module with adjustable log level.",
  "sources": "The 'name' parameter is used to identify the logger instance; 'log_level' is an optional input to set the logging level.",
  "sinks": "The logger outputs log messages to configured handlers, typically stdout or files; no untrusted data is processed directly in a way that leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to create and configure the logger; no data flows from untrusted sources to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard logging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to obtain a logger with an optional log level, then creates a default logger named 'aiotrino' with INFO level. No external inputs are directly processed for sensitive data, and no dynamic code execution or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logger setup with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
