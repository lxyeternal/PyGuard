  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python logging setup module.\n- It defines a default log level, a function `get_logger` to create loggers with optional log level, and initializes a root logger named 'aiotrino' with INFO level.\n- No external inputs, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is standard, benign, and typical for logging configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is correct and performs standard logging setup.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No malicious activity is present.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities or security issues are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Data flows:** No untrusted data flows into sinks.\n- **External dependencies:** Only standard library imports.\n- **Potential attack vectors:** None.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The only minor note is the comment about not calling `setLevel` on the root logger unless intended, but this is a standard practice and not an error.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 as per the report, which seems reasonable given the benign nature, but the overall risk is minimal.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports give malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The risk scores are low (0.1), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.**  \n**The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.**  \n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (as per the reports, reflecting very low security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign logging utility with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
