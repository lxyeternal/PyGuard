{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a basic logging utility in Python, defining a function to create loggers with optional levels and initializing a root logger named 'aiotrino' with INFO level.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it only imports the standard logging module and defines functions and variables internally.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as the code does not process external data or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code creates loggers via get_logger, which could be used elsewhere to log data; however, within this snippet, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard logging setup with no external inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns. It correctly initializes a logger with configurable levels and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure. The code is clear, well-structured, and free from obfuscation or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with its nature. No modifications are necessary.",
