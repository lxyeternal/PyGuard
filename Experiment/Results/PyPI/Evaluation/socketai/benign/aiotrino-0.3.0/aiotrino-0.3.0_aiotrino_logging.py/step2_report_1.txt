  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python logging setup.\n- It defines a default log level (`LEVEL = logging.INFO`).\n- Provides a `get_logger` function that creates a logger with an optional log level.\n- Initializes a root logger named `'aiotrino'` with the default level.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code appears standard and benign.\n- No external inputs, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n- No external data flows or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n\n**Conclusion:** No security issues, malware, or vulnerabilities are evident in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Review the report analyses\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a typical, benign logging utility.\n- They correctly identify that the code only defines functions and initializes a logger.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns are noted.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and aligns with the code.\n\n### Step 3: Scores assessment\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: very low (mostly 0 or 0.1)\n- These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate.\n\n### Step 4: Justification for any higher risk scores\n- Since the code is purely for logging setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.1 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk should stay very low, around 0 or 0.1.\n\n### Step 5: Potential issues or assumptions\n- The reports do not mention any external dependencies or environment factors that could introduce risks.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable considering minimal configuration aspects)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard logging utility, common in many Python projects.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- The consistent and accurate reporting across all reports supports the conclusion that this is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard logging setup with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is. I would suggest maintaining the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the overall security risk at 0.1 or lower.",
