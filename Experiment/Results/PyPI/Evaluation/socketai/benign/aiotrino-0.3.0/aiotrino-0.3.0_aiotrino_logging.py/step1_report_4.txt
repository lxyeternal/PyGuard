{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a logging utility with a function to create named loggers and a default logger configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data is minimal; the only source is the 'name' parameter passed to get_logger().",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. Logging configuration does not send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' flows into get_logger() to create a logger; no external or untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a default logging level and provides a function to obtain loggers with optional custom levels. It sets a default logger named 'aiotrino' with INFO level. No input validation or external data handling that could be exploited is present. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
