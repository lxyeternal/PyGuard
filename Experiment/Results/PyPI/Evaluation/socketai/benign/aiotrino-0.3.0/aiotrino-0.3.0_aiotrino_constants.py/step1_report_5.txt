  "purpose": "Defines constants, headers, and configuration parameters for the AIOTrino Python Client, facilitating interaction with a Trino server.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments, import statements, and string definitions; no external input sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present that handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static constants and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward and configuration-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable declarations and constant definitions related to client configuration and HTTP headers. It does not include any data input, processing, or external interactions that could pose security risks. The headers are standard for Trino database interactions, and no dynamic or untrusted data handling is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secret manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard configuration module setting up constants and headers for a client library. It contains no malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
