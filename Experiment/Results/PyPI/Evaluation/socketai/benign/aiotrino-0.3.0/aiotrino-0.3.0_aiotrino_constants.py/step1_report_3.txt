{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants, default values, and HTTP header names for a Python client library interacting with a Trino server.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and import statements; no external input sources or data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data handling that process untrusted data; primarily static configuration and constant strings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input, as the code only sets up static configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. All variables are constants or type hints; no dynamic code or eval statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining configuration constants, header names, and default values for a client library. There are no functions or data processing logic. The constants include default port numbers, optional parameters, header strings, and type lists. No user input, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure suggests a setup or configuration module rather than operational code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration/constants module for a Python client. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe and typical for such a library.",
