  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code's security implications step-by-step.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely a set of constant definitions for configuration and HTTP headers related to a Python client for Trino.\n- No functions, dynamic code, input handling, or external data sources are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or code that could be exploited.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and standard for such a client library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports identify the code as benign configuration constants with no malicious content.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Are there any?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify the code as static configuration data with no security flaws.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or executable content, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard constants and configuration setup, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any hidden or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**This concludes the review.**",
