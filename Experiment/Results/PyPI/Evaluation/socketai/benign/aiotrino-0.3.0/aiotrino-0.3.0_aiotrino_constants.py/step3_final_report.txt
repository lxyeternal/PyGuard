  "purpose": "Defines constants, default values, and HTTP headers for a Python client library interacting with Trino.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of constants and header field names; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output; purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; constants are used as configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module, defining constants for default ports, source identifiers, header names, and data types. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. The structure is clear, and no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The constants serve as configuration parameters for a Trino Python client, with no embedded secrets or executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and intended for configuration purposes. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
