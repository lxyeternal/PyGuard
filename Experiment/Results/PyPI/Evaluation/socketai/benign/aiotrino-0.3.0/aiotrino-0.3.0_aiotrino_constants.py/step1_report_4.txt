{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define constants, configuration defaults, and HTTP headers for a Python client library interacting with a Trino (formerly Presto) database server.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from constant variable assignments and potentially from external configuration or environment variables not shown here.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are present; the code mainly sets constants and headers for HTTP requests made by the client.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting default configuration values and HTTP headers, likely used later in network requests to the server, but no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing is visible.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution mechanisms. The constants are standard for client configuration; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and import statements. It specifies default ports, configuration options, and HTTP header names used in a client-server interaction with Trino. No input parsing, data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and intended for legitimate client configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of configuration constants and header definitions for a Python client library for Trino. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no indicators of malware or security risks.",
