  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, default values, and HTTP header names for a Python client interacting with a Trino (formerly Presto) server.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals, mainly for configuration and HTTP headers; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or execute code based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code is primarily declarative with constants and configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up static configuration variables and string constants for HTTP communication with a Trino server. No user input handling, data processing, or execution logic is present. All values are predefined, and there are no indications of malicious or suspicious operations. The headers are standard for Trino's protocol, and no external data sources are referenced. The absence of any dynamic code, network activity, or credential handling suggests a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward configuration setup for a Python client library. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets beyond default configuration values, and no evidence of malware or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
