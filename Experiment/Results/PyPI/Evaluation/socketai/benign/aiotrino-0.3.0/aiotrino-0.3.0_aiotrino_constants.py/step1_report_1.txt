{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and header field names for a Python client interacting with a Trino (formerly Presto) database, including default settings and header keys for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; no output or external communication beyond defining constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes static configurations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and consists solely of constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of constant definitions related to HTTP request headers, default configurations, and parameter options for a Python client interacting with Trino. There are no functions, no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data processing. It appears to be a standard setup for request headers and configuration parameters, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration/constants module for a Trino Python client. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. It is a standard setup file with no security concerns.",
