  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static configuration/constants module with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Issues:** No issues found; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** The review accurately notes that the code is purely declarative, defining constants and headers without any external input handling or dynamic execution.\n- **Issues:** No issues; reasoning is solid.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward constants and header definitions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Issues:** No issues; reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is only setting default configuration values and headers, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing.\n- **Issues:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with previous reports; the code is purely static configuration with no malicious behavior.\n- **Issues:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static configuration constants.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None observed; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** All malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or malicious elements, a security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
