{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to Trino database operations, following PEP-0249 standards.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs; it primarily defines classes and imports logging modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present; the code only sets up exception classes and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of dynamic attributes is limited to properties.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes and properties for error handling. It imports a logging module but does not perform any logging or I/O operations. There are no dynamic code executions, no network activity, no credential handling, and no suspicious logic or data handling. All classes extend standard exception hierarchies, and there are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for database error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
