  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports describe code that defines exception classes for Trino database errors, following PEP 249 standards.\n- The code imports standard modules, defines error classes, and encapsulates error details via properties.\n- No external network, file, or data exfiltration activities are reported or detected.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code appears purely structural, intended for error handling and reporting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  The code does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities. It is purely class definitions with safe property accessors.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code correctly implements exception classes with appropriate properties.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk)?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n  These are consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores?**  \n  The code is purely structural; no external influence or malicious activity. Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n- **Malware concerns?**  \n  No malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration, is present. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Consistency of scores?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any hidden issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Malicious activity?**  \n  None detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
