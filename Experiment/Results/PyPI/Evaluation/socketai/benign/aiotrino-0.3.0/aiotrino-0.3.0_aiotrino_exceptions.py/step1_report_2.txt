  "purpose": "Define exceptions for handling various Trino database operation errors, including error properties and custom error classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements, error class definitions, property methods accessing error data dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data is used in sensitive operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "Error object creation and property access flow, retrieving error details from dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed. The code strictly defines error classes and properties without external data manipulation or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions, with properties accessing dictionary attributes. There is no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. It follows standard Python practices for error handling and logging. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of exception classes for a database client library. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is safe and well-structured.",
