{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors in Trino database operations, following PEP 249 standards.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines exception classes, accesses error information via properties.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling, no external outputs, no network communication, no file operations.",
  "flows": "Error information flows through properties and class methods, but involves only internal exception data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; code structure appears standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes for error handling related to Trino database interactions. It imports standard typing modules and a logging module, then sets up multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception and other custom error classes. The TrinoQueryError class processes error details via properties, extracting information from a provided error dictionary. No data is read from external sources, nor is there any processing of untrusted input. There are no network operations, file I/O, or cryptographic functions. The code follows typical patterns for exception class definitions and error property accessors. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard exception handling setup for a database client library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to organize error types and extract error info from error dictionaries. No indicators of malware, suspicious data flow, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
