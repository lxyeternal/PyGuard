  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining exception classes for Trino database errors, following PEP-0249 standards.\n- The code imports standard modules (`typing`) and a logging module (`aiotrino.logging`), but no actual logging occurs.\n- Exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, and properties access error data from dictionaries.\n- No network, file I/O, or external data processing is present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, purely structural, and contains no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code. The code is purely class definitions and property accessors.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- **Scores Given:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n  - Security Risk: 0, matching the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:** The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could cause security issues. Error dictionaries are assumed to be well-formed, but that is standard and acceptable in this context.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores Justification:** The assigned scores (all zero for malware and obfuscated, zero for security risk) are appropriate.\n\n### Any Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for a database client library, with no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The reported scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
