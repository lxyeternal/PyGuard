  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code solely defines exception classes for Trino database operations.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or file I/O is present.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code relies on standard Python exception inheritance and safe property accessors.\n- Import statements are limited to typing annotations and a logging module, with no active logging or external calls.\n- Error information is encapsulated in dictionaries, with properties safely retrieving data.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or external dependencies that could be malicious are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The `TrinoQueryError` class processes error dictionaries, providing properties for error details, which is standard practice.\n- Subclasses like `TrinoExternalError`, `TrinoInternalError`, and `TrinoUserError` extend the base error class, aligning with typical error categorization.\n- The logging module is imported but not actively used in the code snippets provided; this is typical for a module intended for error definitions.\n\n**Assessment of malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's purpose as a structural exception module without external interactions or data handling.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n\n- No issues or flaws are identified in the logic, reasoning, or implementation.\n- The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The use of properties to access dictionary data is safe and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception handling module for a database client library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Remain at 0.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code is benign, standard, and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Summary estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the purpose of the code.",
