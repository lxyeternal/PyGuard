{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in Trino database operations, including specific error types and related properties.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'aiotrino.logging'. Error data passed as dictionaries in 'TrinoQueryError' constructor.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted input data in a way that affects security or leaks information.",
  "flows": "Error dictionaries provided to 'TrinoQueryError' propagate through properties, but no external data or untrusted inputs are processed dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. No code that executes untrusted data or performs network/system actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes exception classes for error handling, adhering to standard design patterns. It imports logging but does not perform any logging actions. The 'TrinoQueryError' class extracts information from a dictionary; this is safe as it only reads data. No user input, network calls, or file operations are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines error classes for use in other modules. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
