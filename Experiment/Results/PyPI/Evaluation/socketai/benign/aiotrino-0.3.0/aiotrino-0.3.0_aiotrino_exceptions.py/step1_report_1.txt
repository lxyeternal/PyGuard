{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors in Trino database operations, following pep-0249 standards.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing' and 'aiotrino.logging'; Error and subclass constructors; property methods accessing error details.",
  "sinks": "Error message properties that generate error descriptions; __repr__ and __str__ methods that output error info.",
  "flows": "Error data passed into constructors, accessed via properties, and formatted into strings for logs or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic detected. No network or data exfiltration behavior. Code primarily defines exception classes and properties.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes and properties for error handling related to Trino database operations. It imports standard and third-party modules for type annotations and logging. All classes extend standard exception classes without executing external commands, network requests, or data processing beyond attribute access. Error details are encapsulated within dictionaries, with properties safely retrieving error info. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious code patterns are present. The logging setup appears standard, used for debugging or error reporting. The code is purely structural, designed for exception handling, with no external influence or data leakage present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Trino, following established standards. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as error structure definitions.",
