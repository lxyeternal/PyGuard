{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for Trino database errors, following PEP-0249 standards, to handle various error scenarios in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "Error dictionaries passed to TrinoQueryError and its subclasses, accessed via properties such as error_code, error_name, error_type, failure_info, message, and error_location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; the code does not contain sinks that could lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Error dictionaries (sources) flow into exception class constructors, and properties access nested error details; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution detected. The code is straightforward class definitions with safe property access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for handling Trino errors, encapsulating error details within properties that safely access dictionary keys. It imports standard modules and a logging component but does not perform any logging or external operations. The structure is standard and intended for error reporting; no malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is present. The error classes and properties are implemented correctly, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The code is purely structural, serving as a foundation for error handling in a database client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes for Trino error handling, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
