  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to Trino database operations.\n   - It follows standard Python practices, importing typing and logging modules, defining custom exceptions, and encapsulating error details within properties.\n   - No external network, file, or data manipulation occurs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.\n   - The error classes, especially `TrinoQueryError`, provide structured access to error information, which is typical in error handling modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes and properties.\n   - They note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No discrepancies or inaccuracies are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a high risk score; the code is purely for error handling and does not perform any external or sensitive operations.\n   - All scores are appropriately low, indicating no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code is standard exception handling without malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable given the code content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module for Trino database errors. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.",
