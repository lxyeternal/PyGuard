  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, the code's behavior, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Trino database error handling.\n- It imports standard modules (`typing`) and a logging module (`aiotrino.logging`) without performing any dynamic or external operations.\n- The exception classes mainly encapsulate error information, with properties safely accessing data from error dictionaries.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The code adheres to standard Python practices for defining exception hierarchies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n   All reports describe the code as defining exception classes, with no suspicious or malicious logic. This aligns with the actual code content.\n\n2. **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n   - No syntax errors or logical flaws are evident.\n   - The properties handle missing keys gracefully.\n   - The inheritance structure is consistent.\n   - The use of `repr` and `str` methods is appropriate.\n\n3. **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty that the analysis is correct.\n\n4. **Are the risk scores justified?**  \n   - Since the code is purely structural, defining exception classes, and does not perform any external operations, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n   - Obfuscated code score is 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - Security risk score is 0; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n5. **Are any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n   - No. All claims are cautious and based on actual code analysis.\n\n6. **Are the scores consistent with the report content?**  \n   - Yes, all scores align with the code's behavior and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified; purely structural exception definitions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for Trino error handling. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
