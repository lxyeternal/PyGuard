  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for async iteration with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security assessment is that the code is safe. The only caveat is the inherent trust required when passing callables to 'aiter', but this is typical for such utilities and not a security flaw."
