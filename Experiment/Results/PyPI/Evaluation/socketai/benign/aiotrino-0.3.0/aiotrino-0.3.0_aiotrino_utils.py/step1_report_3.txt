{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous iterator helper functions: 'aiter' for obtaining async iterators from async iterables or callables, and 'anext' for advancing async iterators.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'obj' parameter passed to 'aiter' (which can be an async iterable or async callable), and the 'async_iterator' parameter in 'anext'.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not write to or affect external systems, so no data sink operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input 'obj' or callable to the async iterator, and 'anext' consumes the async iterator to fetch the next item.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward utility functions without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two helper functions for asynchronous iteration. 'aiter' converts an async iterable or an async callable into an async iterator, raising appropriate TypeErrors for incorrect types. 'anext' retrieves the next item from an async iterator, also verifying that the input has the '__anext__' method. There is no data leakage, external network communication, or suspicious code. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of async iterator helpers with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs expected functions with appropriate type checks and no external side effects.",
