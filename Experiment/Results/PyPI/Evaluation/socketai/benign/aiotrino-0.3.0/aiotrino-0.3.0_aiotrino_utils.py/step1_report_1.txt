{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for asynchronous iteration in Python, specifically 'aiter' to create async iterators from async iterables or callables, and 'anext' to retrieve the next item from an async iterator.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'obj' parameter in 'aiter', which can be an async iterable or a callable. 'anext' reads from the provided async iterator.",
  "sinks": "The functions themselves do not contain sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities; they simply handle async iteration mechanics.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' in 'aiter' flows into type checks and possibly into an async generator. The 'async_iterator' in 'anext' is used to retrieve the next item, with no external untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs. The sentinel object prevents infinite loops. The functions are straightforward utility helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements async iteration helpers with proper type checks. No malicious behavior is evident. The functions rely on standard Python async features. No suspicious data handling or network operations are present. The sentinel pattern prevents infinite iteration. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for async iteration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply facilitates asynchronous iteration patterns without any malicious behavior.",
