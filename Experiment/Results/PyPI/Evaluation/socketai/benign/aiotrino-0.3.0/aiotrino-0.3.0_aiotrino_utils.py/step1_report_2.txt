{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous helper functions for iterating over async iterables and callables, enabling easier asynchronous iteration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the provided async iterable or async callable passed as arguments to 'aiter'.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with untrusted async callables and iterables, but does not process external input directly in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Input data from async iterable or callable flows into the 'aiter' or 'anext' functions, which yield or return values asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features; no suspicious or unusual code structures or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for asynchronous iteration: 'aiter' converts an async iterable or callable into an async iterator, raising type errors for invalid inputs. 'anext' retrieves the next item from an async iterator, raising a type error if the object is not an async iterator. The code relies on standard Python library features and does not include external data sources or sinks that could be exploited. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be a benign utility module for async iteration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for async iteration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data or perform external communications, and no anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
