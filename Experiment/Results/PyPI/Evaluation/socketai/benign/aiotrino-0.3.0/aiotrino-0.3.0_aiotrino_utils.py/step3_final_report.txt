{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions 'aiter' and 'anext' for asynchronous iteration in Python, enabling conversion of async iterables or callables into async iterators and retrieving next items.",
  "sources": "The functions read input from async iterables or async callables passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs; potential data flow involves invoking 'await obj()' in 'aiter' when 'obj' is a callable.",
  "flows": "Source: async iterable or callable -> 'aiter' invokes or iterates -> yields values; 'anext' retrieves next item from async iterator.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'await obj()' in 'aiter' could execute arbitrary code if 'obj' is malicious or untrusted, but this is expected behavior for such utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard async iteration helpers with proper type checks and a sentinel to prevent infinite loops. It does not include network operations, data leaks, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is executing 'await obj()' with untrusted callables, which could run malicious code, but this is inherent to the utility's purpose. All five reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and safe, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0. The confidence scores are high, reflecting thorough analysis. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for async iteration with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security assessment is that the code is safe. The only caveat is the inherent trust required when passing callables to 'aiter', but this is typical for such utilities and not a security flaw.",
