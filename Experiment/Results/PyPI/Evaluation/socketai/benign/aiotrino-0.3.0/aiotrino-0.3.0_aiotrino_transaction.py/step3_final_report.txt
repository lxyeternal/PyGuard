{
  "purpose": "Provides transaction control (begin, commit, rollback) for an asynchronous database client interacting with a Trino server via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "HTTP responses headers (transaction IDs), request methods (post, get), internal state variables (_id, _request).",
  "sinks": "Response headers (headers.get), internal state updates (_id), exception raising on failure.",
  "flows": "HTTP response headers -> internal _id update -> transaction state variables -> exception handling or success logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages transactions asynchronously, extracting transaction IDs from response headers, and handles errors properly. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The logic aligns with standard REST API transaction management. The use of headers for transaction IDs is typical but relies on header integrity, which is standard in such systems. No vulnerabilities or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of async transaction management with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.",
