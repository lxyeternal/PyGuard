  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All describe the code as a standard Python package initialization (__init__.py) file that imports internal modules and version metadata, then exposes them via `__all__`. They note the absence of data flows, sinks, anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Code content:** The code is purely import statements, metadata definitions, and the `__all__` list. No data input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Malicious indicators:** None. The code is consistent with a typical package __init__.py, setting up module exports and metadata.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and scoring considerations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the benign nature, the malware score should remain at 0. No malicious behavior or code is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Confirmed as 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is just setup and import, with no security implications, the overall security risk should be 0.\n\n- **Confidence:** All reports have high confidence (1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical, benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, straightforward, and standard for a Python package. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or context is needed.",
