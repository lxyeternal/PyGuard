{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization (__init__.py) file that imports internal modules and version metadata, then exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module imports and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static import statements and metadata exposure, with no dynamic data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup file, importing modules and defining __all__. It contains only licensing comments and static import statements, with no data input, network activity, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward, and no malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to set up module exports and metadata, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
