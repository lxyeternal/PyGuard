  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent implementation of an async Python client for Trino. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are evident. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to potential injection if inputs are mishandled externally. The code is suitable for open-source use with standard precautions."
