  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements an async Python DBAPI 2.0 client for Trino, with connection, query, and cursor management. The analysis states that the code is standard, with parameter formatting functions that translate Python types into SQL literals, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - The code uses functions like `_format_prepared_param` to convert Python data types into SQL literals, which is typical.\n  - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n  - No suspicious network activity or backdoors.\n  - The scoring of malware (0) and obfuscated (0) aligns with the review.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate. The code is a standard async database client with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code handles SQL parameterization carefully, with no signs of malicious behavior. The main concern is the potential for SQL injection if untrusted input is used, but the code's parameter formatting mitigates this risk.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - The code employs parameterized queries and escaping strategies.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network calls.\n  - The malware score (0) and obfuscated (0) are justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent. The code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code manages connections, queries, and parameters securely, with no signs of malicious activity. The review highlights safe parameter handling and standard network communication.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - The code's design aligns with best practices.\n  - No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors.\n  - Malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate. The code seems benign and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the standard implementation of a database client, with safe parameter escaping and no suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets. The potential concern about dynamic SQL construction is mitigated by proper escaping.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - The code uses careful parameter formatting.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious code.\n  - Malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code handles connection and query execution securely, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain issues.\n\n- **Evaluation:**\n  - Proper parameter escaping and session management.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.\n  - Malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward structure and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The reports' scores of around 0.1-0.2 reflect low security risk, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal security risk, primarily due to the potential for SQL injection if untrusted input is mishandled externally, but the code's internal handling appears safe.\n\n**Note:** The overall scoring aligns with the detailed analysis. The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of an async Trino database client with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code is a legitimate, well-structured async Python DBAPI client for Trino, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores given in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
