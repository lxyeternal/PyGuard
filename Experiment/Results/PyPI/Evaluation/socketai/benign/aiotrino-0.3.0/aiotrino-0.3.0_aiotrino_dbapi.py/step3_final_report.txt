  "purpose": "An async Python DBAPI 2.0 client implementation for Trino, handling connections, queries, and cursors with safe parameter formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for connection setup, query strings, and data types processed in _format_prepared_param.",
  "sinks": "SQL command strings sent over network via aiotrino.client.TrinoQuery, network requests through aiohttp sessions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into formatted SQL literals via _format_prepared_param, then into aiotrino.client.TrinoQuery for execution over HTTP.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. Parameter escaping functions mitigate injection risks.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard parameter formatting to prevent SQL injection, manages connections and transactions appropriately, and uses common libraries for async network communication. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security measures and code structure align with best practices for database clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and transparent implementation of an async Python client for Trino. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are evident. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) due to potential injection if inputs are mishandled externally. The code is suitable for open-source use with standard precautions.",
