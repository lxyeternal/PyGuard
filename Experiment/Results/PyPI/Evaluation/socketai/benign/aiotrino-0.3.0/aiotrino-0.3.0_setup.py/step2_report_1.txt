  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same setup script for the 'aiotrino' package.\n- The code uses 'exec' to load version info from '_version.py'.\n- No network activity, user input, or external data processing occurs.\n- The code appears standard for a Python setup script.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Analysis:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The 'exec' call is typical in setup scripts, assuming the version file is trusted.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The use of 'exec' could be a minor security concern if '_version.py' is compromised, but this is a common pattern. No other flaws are detected.\n- **Malware or suspicious behavior:** None detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Data sinks or flows:** Only static file reads and package configuration functions are used; no untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** The only potential concern is the 'exec' on '_version.py', which could be risky if the file is tampered with, but in a controlled environment, this is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Confidence | Notes |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|--------------|--------|\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.9 | No malicious activity; standard setup script. |\n| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | 0.9 | Slightly higher security risk due to 'exec', but still benign. |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | No issues; standard setup. |\n| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 | 0.9 | Similar to above; 'exec' minor concern. |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 | 0.9 | Same reasoning. |\n\n**The 'malware' score remains at 0** because there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**The 'obfuscated' score remains at 0** because the code is clear and standard.\n\n**The 'risk' score** is very low (0 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal concern about the 'exec' usage.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minor concern about 'exec', but common in setup scripts)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to 'exec' usage, but widely accepted in packaging scripts)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign setup script with no malware or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if the version file is compromised.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** This code is safe and standard for package setup. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present.",
