  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the aiotrino project, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '_version.py', reading README.md, and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; only static file reads and package setup functions.",
  "flows": "Reading version info and README content, then passing metadata to setup(). No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The use of 'exec' to execute version file could be risky if the version file is tampered with, but in a typical setup, this is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses 'exec' to run a version file, which is common in setup scripts. It reads the README.md file, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with package info and dependencies. All actions are related to package configuration, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious code evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The use of 'exec' on a local version file is typical, assuming the version file is trusted. No malware or security threats detected.",
