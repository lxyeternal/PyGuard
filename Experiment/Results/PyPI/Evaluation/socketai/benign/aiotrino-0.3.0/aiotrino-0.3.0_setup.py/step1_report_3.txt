  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, managing dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from '_version.py', reads README.md for long description, and reads dependencies for installation and testing.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data directly influences system behavior; all data appears to be static or sourced from known files.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata and version info from files, assigns dependencies, and configures package setup parameters; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations; standard setup.py pattern observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads version information and description from external files, then configures package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code structure and content align with typical packaging scripts and contain no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and benign setup configuration for a Python package. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. All dependencies and metadata are statically defined or sourced from local files, with no indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
