  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '_version.py' and 'README.md' files, and defining install and extra requirements.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not perform any operations involving untrusted data, network, or sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted inputs. The exec() call executes version info from a local file, which is controlled within the package.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run contents of '_version.py' could be risky if the file contents are compromised; however, in a controlled package environment, this is a common pattern for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads version info via exec(), reads README for long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. No user input or external data is processed at runtime. The exec() usage is typical for dynamic version loading but could be considered a minor risk if '_version.py' is tampered with. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The dependencies are standard for a Python package setup. Overall, the code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for Python packaging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The use of exec() is noted but not inherently malicious in this context. Overall security risk is negligible.",
