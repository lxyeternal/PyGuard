{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'aiotrino/_version.py', reading 'README.md', and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code primarily handles package setup. No untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process untrusted input; it only executes static configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute the contents of '_version.py' could be risky if the file contains malicious code, but this is common in setup scripts to load version info. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports static package data, reads version information and README content, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. The use of 'exec' on '_version.py' is standard practice to load version info but could be risky if the file is tampered with. All dependencies are specified explicitly. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which is common but could be exploited if the version file is compromised. Overall, the code appears benign.",
