{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging of the 'aiotrino' Python project, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py' via exec(), reads 'README.md', and static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a trusted file, then proceeds with static configuration; no data flows involving external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' to load version info could be risky if '_version.py' is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the use of 'exec()' on a version file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. No network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution occurs. The dependencies and package data are static and well-defined. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is clear and straightforward, with scores reflecting minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malware or malicious intent. The minor risk associated with 'exec()' is typical in such scripts and does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the package is safe to use.",
