  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- Reads version info from '_version.py' via exec().\n- Reads README.md for long description.\n- Defines dependencies, extras, classifiers, and entry points.\n- No network activity, user input, or dynamic code execution beyond static file reads and exec().\n- Uses 'exec' to load version info, which is common but could be risky if the version file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **The code does not contain malicious code or malware.**\n- **The use of 'exec' on '_version.py' is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is tampered with.** However, this is standard practice in many setup scripts.\n- **No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data leaks are present.**\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, standard setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Conclusion:** Similar to Report 1, with a note on 'exec' being a minor risk if '_version.py' is tampered with.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 (minor concern about 'exec')\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The use of 'exec' is standard but should be noted as a minor risk.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard setup script, no malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Conclusion:** Similar to others, with focus on 'exec' risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still minor)\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup, minor concern about 'exec'.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, with some minor concern about 'exec' usage, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to 'exec' usage, but not a significant security threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which is standard but should be used with trusted files.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No malicious or suspicious activity detected.  \n- The overall security risk is negligible.",
