  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of data mappers converting database responses into Python types. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The only decoding is base64 for binary data, which is standard.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n  - **Logic & Reasoning:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning. No malicious intent, standard data conversions, and safe practices. Slightly higher confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.2), which is acceptable given the context.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable for data parsing code, which could be misused if input is malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n  - **Logic & Reasoning:** Sound.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing standard practices, no malicious behavior, and safe data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.1 — low, consistent with data parsing modules.\n  - **Reasoning:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on data transformation, no suspicious activity, standard library usage, and safe data conversions.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, given the data transformations involved.\n  - **Reasoning:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with the scoring or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** A comprehensive review noting that the code is standard for database data mapping, with no malicious intent. It highlights potential risks associated with decoding functions but clarifies that these are typical and not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n  - **Reasoning:** Well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is standard data mapping code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports, reflecting minor inherent risks in data parsing but not security issues.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a typical data mapping layer for database responses.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The minor security risk scores are justified due to the potential misuse of parsing functions if fed malicious data, but the code itself is safe.\n- The reasoning in all reports is accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — considering potential misuse of parsing functions if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; no changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
