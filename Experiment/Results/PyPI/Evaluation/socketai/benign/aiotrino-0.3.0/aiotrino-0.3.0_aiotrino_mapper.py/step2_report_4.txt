  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the described code with the actual implementation, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code maps database results into Python types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. Uses standard libraries and safe practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — aligns well with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence)\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the schema-driven mapper creation and data flow.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, standard data conversions, proper exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — slightly conservative but acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes data conversion from strings to Python types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; decoding and parsing are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes data flow from database strings to Python types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard data transformations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes data transformations, including base64, date/time parsing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes that while functions like base64 decoding and date parsing could be exploited if data is malicious, these are standard practices. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Review:** The code is a comprehensive, schema-driven data mapper layer for database types, with standard conversions, error handling, and use of well-known libraries.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports agree on zero malware and obfuscation, which is consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports, mainly due to data decoding/parsing functions, but these are standard and not inherently risky unless combined with malicious input. No evidence of malicious intent or activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — low, mainly due to potential misuse of data parsing functions if input is malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured data mapping layer for database responses. No malicious or obfuscated activity is present. The slight security risk score reflects the importance of validating input data but does not indicate any actual security flaw.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the detailed code review.",
