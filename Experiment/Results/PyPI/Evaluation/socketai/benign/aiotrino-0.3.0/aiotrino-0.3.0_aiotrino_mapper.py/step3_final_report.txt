  "purpose": "Data mapping layer converting database responses into Python types, including handling of complex types and special values.",
  "sources": "External database responses, schema definitions, data rows, and type signatures.",
  "sinks": "In-memory Python objects; no external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Schema-driven creation of type-specific mappers, then data transformation from raw strings or structures into Python types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; standard decoding (base64), date/time parsing, and type conversions are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code employs straightforward, well-structured data conversion functions for various data types, utilizing standard Python libraries and practices. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The base64 decoding, date parsing, UUID handling, and exception management are typical for such data mapping layers. The security risk stems mainly from potential misuse of parsing functions if fed malicious data, but this is inherent to data deserialization and not a flaw in the code. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data mapping implementation with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The minor security risk scores reflect the inherent risks in data parsing but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
