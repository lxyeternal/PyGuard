{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of data mappers for converting various database types into Python native types, primarily for use with a database client such as Trino.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from string inputs, especially from database responses (e.g., string representations of dates, times, UUIDs, JSON, etc.), and from function arguments for creating mappers and processing data rows.",
  "sinks": "Mapped data is returned as Python native types. No external sinks or data transmission are present within this code. There are no network operations or data leaks initiated by the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings (possibly from database responses), through various mapper classes that convert these strings into Python types, and then into Python data structures such as lists or tuples.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a database driver; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The `_create_tzinfo` function handles timezone parsing securely. The code avoids executing untrusted code or performing unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically maps database types to Python objects, with appropriate handling for different types and potential errors. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors is evident. All data transformations are predictable and standard. The only potential concern could be if untrusted input is passed to the mappers, but this is inherent to any data deserialization process and not specific malicious code. The code relies on standard Python libraries and proper error handling, without any suspicious network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, legitimate data mapping module for a database driver, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations outside its intended scope of data transformation.",
