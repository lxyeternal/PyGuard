  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'aiotrino' Python package, which is an asyncio client for the Trino distributed SQL engine.",
  "sources": "Constants and metadata assignments (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only assigns string literals to variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all variables are assigned static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed. No secrets or code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting package metadata. No input reading, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The variables contain static strings, URLs, and contact info. No suspicious or malicious activity, no code injection, or harmful logic present. The metadata appears typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code simply defines package metadata without any potentially harmful elements.",
