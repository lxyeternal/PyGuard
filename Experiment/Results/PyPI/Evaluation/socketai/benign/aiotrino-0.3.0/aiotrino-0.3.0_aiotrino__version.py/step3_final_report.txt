  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, etc.) for a Python package, serving informational and organizational purposes during packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments at the module level (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__)",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no dynamic or input/output operations",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of static, straightforward variable assignments with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static declaration of package metadata variables, typical for Python modules defining package info. No dynamic code, network activity, or external data handling is present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and require no modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
