  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'aiotrino' Python package, an asyncio client for the Trino distributed SQL engine.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments for metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network calls, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely metadata assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of straightforward variable assignments for package metadata",
  "analysis": "The code initializes module-level variables with static strings that describe package details. There are no input operations, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution. The absence of such behavior indicates no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The code serves as metadata documentation for the package, which is standard practice and does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
