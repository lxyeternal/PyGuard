  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'aiotrino' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, email, and license information.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting string literals to module-level variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output operations, or external calls present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only assigns static strings to variables without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward metadata assignment with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains variable assignments for package metadata, which is standard practice in Python modules. No inputs are read, no external data is processed, and no functions or control structures are present. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a benign, well-structured package info module.",
