  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'aiotrino' Python package, an asyncio client for the Trino SQL engine.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string and URL literals for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or processing; no data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no flow analysis needed.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward metadata assignment with no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module-level string assignments setting package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, email, and license. These are static literals with no dynamic execution, input/output operations, or external interactions. There are no functions, classes, or executable statements. The content appears typical for a Python package's metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as package metadata documentation. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
