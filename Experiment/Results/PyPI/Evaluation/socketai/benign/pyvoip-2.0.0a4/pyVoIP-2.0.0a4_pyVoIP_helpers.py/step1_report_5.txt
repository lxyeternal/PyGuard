{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple counter class with methods to get current value, increment, and retrieve the next value.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No output, data transmission, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; class methods manipulate internal state only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and does not perform any external actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic Counter class with internal state 'x' initialized to a default value. Methods count(), next(), and current() manipulate and access this state. No external inputs, no network operations, no data leaks, no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The implementation appears safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign counter class with no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It performs basic internal state management without external interactions.",
