  "purpose": "A simple counter class that tracks an integer value and provides methods to increment and retrieve it.",
  "sources": "Initialization of self.x in __init__ and access in count(), next(), and current() methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in count(), next(), and current() methods.",
  "flows": "Method calls to count() and next() modify and return the counter value; current() reads the value without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no external input or data reading, no suspicious or unusual code constructs, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward Counter class with methods to increment and retrieve a counter value. All operations are internal and purely numeric manipulations. There are no external data sources, no data leakage points, and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The structure is simple, and no code performs network operations, file access, or any other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a counter class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
