{
  "purpose": "A simple counter class that maintains and increments an internal count.",
  "sources": "Input data: None explicitly; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No external data flow; methods operate internally on the class's state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic Counter class with methods to initialize, increment, and retrieve the current count. There are no external data sources, no data transformations or external interactions, and no suspicious or malicious constructs present. The class functions as a straightforward counter without side effects, external dependencies, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign implementation of a counter class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
