  "purpose": "A simple counter class for tracking sequential numbers.",
  "sources": "Initialization of self.x in __init__ method; reading self.x in current() method.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in count(), next(), current() methods.",
  "flows": "self.x is read in count() and current(); updated in count(); returned in all methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs; no external data sources or sinks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic counter with methods to get the current count, increment, and retrieve the next value. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, and no external communication. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward and functions solely as a simple counter.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a counter class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within memory without external interactions.",
