The main concern is the potential for security misconfiguration due to deprecated and optional insecure settings, but these are explicitly documented and configurable. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting configuration-related security considerations rather than malicious activity."

The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code."

The low security risk score reflects in-memory plaintext storage, which is typical for such utilities but should be secured in production environments. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

Other reports are benign or lack sufficient data, with scores appropriately set to zero or low values. The overall assessment indicates that Report 1 warrants cautious review, but no definitive malicious payload is confirmed."
