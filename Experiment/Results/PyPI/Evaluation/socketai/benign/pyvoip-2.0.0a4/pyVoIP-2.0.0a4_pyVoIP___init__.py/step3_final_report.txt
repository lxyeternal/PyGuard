  "purpose": "Configuration and security parameter setup for a VoIP protocol library, including TLS settings, protocol constants, and debugging controls.",
  "sources": "Global variables for TLS verification modes, debug flag, protocol constants, and the set_tls_security function which modifies TLS settings.",
  "sinks": "The set_tls_security function potentially alters TLS verification modes, which could weaken security if misused, but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input to set_tls_security (verify_mode) influences global TLS_CHECK_HOSTNAME and TLS_VERIFY_MODE variables, affecting TLS connection security parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated security options (MD5, default insecure TLS settings), and the ability to disable hostname verification via set_tls_security, which could be misused to weaken security but is not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a configuration module for a VoIP library, managing TLS security options, protocol constants, and debugging flags. No suspicious or malicious code is present; the use of deprecated security mechanisms and configurable TLS verification introduces potential security risks but does not constitute malicious activity. The global variables and functions are straightforward, with clear documentation. The security risk primarily stems from the potential to weaken TLS security if misconfigured, but this is a known and documented aspect of configurable security settings. The malware score is zero, obfuscated code is absent, and the overall security risk is low to moderate, justified by the presence of insecure defaults and deprecated options.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is the potential for security misconfiguration due to deprecated and optional insecure settings, but these are explicitly documented and configurable. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting configuration-related security considerations rather than malicious activity.",
