  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues, scores, and conclusions are justified.\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is configuration for a VoIP module, with no suspicious behaviors. It notes the use of deprecated security options (MD5, basic auth), but these are security concerns rather than malicious. The `set_tls_security` function manages TLS settings responsibly.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.3, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence is justified; no malicious intent is evident. The security risk score is moderate due to deprecated security options, but this is a configuration concern, not an attack.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard configuration with TLS options and debug controls. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The security risk is low, considering the configuration nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward configuration module with no suspicious behavior. Uses ':memory:' for database, which is for debugging.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard configuration, with a note on the debugging database location.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct scores; no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, managing TLS and protocol parameters with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher in some reports (up to 0.3), mainly due to deprecated security options and configurable TLS verification, which could be misused if misconfigured. However, these are configuration issues, not malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n\n**Security Risk:** Given the presence of deprecated security options (MD5, basic auth disabled by default, TLS fallback not implemented), I would assign a moderate risk score of **0.2 to 0.3**. The current reports mostly rate it at 0.2-0.3, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Confidence:** High (around 0.9-1), as the code is straightforward and well-documented.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed in scores.\n- The code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent.\n- The security concerns are configuration-related, not malicious.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall risk and malware scores should remain low (around 0.2), with high confidence that this code is benign.",
