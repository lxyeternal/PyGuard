  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is the potential for security misconfiguration due to deprecated and optional insecure settings, but these are explicitly documented and configurable. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is approximately 0.2-0.3, reflecting configuration-related security considerations rather than malicious activity."
