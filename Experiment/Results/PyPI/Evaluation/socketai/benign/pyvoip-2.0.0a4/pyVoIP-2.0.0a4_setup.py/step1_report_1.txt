  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the pyVoIP package, including metadata, description, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external calls with untrusted data",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content into long_description, then passing setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads a README file for description and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. There are no external input sources beyond reading a static file, no sinks that process untrusted data, and no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
