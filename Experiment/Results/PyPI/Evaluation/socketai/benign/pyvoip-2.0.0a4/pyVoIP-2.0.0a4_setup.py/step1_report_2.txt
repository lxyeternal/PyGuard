  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the pyVoIP Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md → setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: reading a markdown file for description, defining package metadata, and configuring packaging options. The read operation is from a static file (README.md) and does not process or handle untrusted input. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present. All package information appears legitimate and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
