  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system calls",
  "flows": "Static file read, then data passed into setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. It reads a static README.md file and sets package metadata. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence. No anomalies or malicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
