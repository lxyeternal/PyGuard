  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyVoIP package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the script primarily reads a file and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "File reading flow from README.md to long_description, then passing static data to setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward package setup without unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README.md file to obtain the long description and then calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. All data appears hardcoded or read from trusted sources. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a package setup configuration. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
