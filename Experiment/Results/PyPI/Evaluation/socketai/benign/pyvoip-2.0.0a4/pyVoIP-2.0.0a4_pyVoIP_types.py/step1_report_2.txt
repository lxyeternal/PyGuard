{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and constants related to socket connections, SSL, and credentials handling in a network communication context.",
  "sources": "No specific data sources read during execution; only type definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data flows leading to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely declares types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases for headers, sockets, and credentials, as well as a constant for a credential dictionary structure. It uses typing annotations to facilitate clearer API design. There is no runtime logic, user input processing, or data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities. The definitions appear to be standard and safe, with no embedded or hidden malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions and constants intended for network communication and credentials management. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It appears to be safe and straightforward.",
