  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely structural, with no runtime logic, data processing, or potential for malicious behavior.\n- The code consists solely of type aliases, constants, and data structure definitions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The credential structures are flexible and designed for safe, standard use.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Defines type aliases and constants for socket handling, credentials, and headers. No external input, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code is just type annotations and constants.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is low (0.1), which seems reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe, standard type definitions.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no runtime logic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is 0, consistent.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Defines types and constants, with emphasis on flexibility and standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is 0, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on network communication and credentials, noting potential sensitive data storage but no actual data.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no data flow or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is minimal.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, defining types for SIP headers and credentials, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, risk is negligible.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 or 0) are reasonable given the content.\n- The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all, as no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of actual data or logic, I would assign a risk score of **0** for all reports, as the code is purely definitional.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, purely type annotations and constants.\n- No changes needed in scores or reasoning.\n- The overall security assessment should be a malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
