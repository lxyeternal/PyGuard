  "purpose": "Define type aliases and constants for network socket handling, security credentials, and URI headers in a network-related Python application.",
  "sources": "Type hints and constant definitions; no external input sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias definitions for socket types, security credential handling, and header dictionaries. It uses standard Python typing and socket/ssl modules without performing any operations or data processing. There are no functions, input handling, or data manipulations that could lead to malicious behavior. The credential-related constants are only type annotations, not actual data or secrets. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for network socket and credential type definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application or library setup, not a standalone malicious payload.",
