  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type alias definitions, constants, and data structures.\n- No functions, data processing, network operations, or runtime logic are present.\n- The credential structures are generic and do not contain actual secrets.\n- The use of `Callable` for password retrieval is standard in secure applications.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines types and constants for socket handling and credentials; no external input or data flow; no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 seem reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of data processing or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely type annotations and constants.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** No data input, no processing, no secrets; straightforward type definitions.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is safe and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes potential sensitivity in the data structures but finds no actual secrets or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is preparatory, with no active data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Structural setup for SIP headers and credentials, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior; I concur with a malware score of **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is present; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to potential sensitive data, but no actual secrets are present. A risk score of **0.1** is reasonable, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious intent or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, based on the potential for sensitive data structures, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. The scores are reasonable, and the reasoning is sound. No further adjustments are necessary.",
