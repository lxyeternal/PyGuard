  "purpose": "Type aliases and constants for socket handling, credentials, and headers in network communication.",
  "sources": "Definitions of socket types, credential structures, and header dictionaries; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static type and data structure definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code contains only type annotations and constants, with no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, constants, and data structure definitions for socket and credential handling. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or embedded secrets. The use of Callable for password retrieval is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present. The code appears to be a benign setup for a larger application, serving as a structural foundation without any active logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a structural setup for network and credential data types. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is safe and standard, with scores reflecting minimal risk.",
