  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type aliases, constants, and data structure definitions.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The use of Callable for password retrieval is standard in secure applications.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger, security-conscious codebase, serving as a type and structure setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is only defining types and constants, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Confidence 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate, given the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious code. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is only type definitions and constants, with no data flow or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; no runtime logic, no secrets, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes that the code defines data types and constants, with potential sensitive data only in structure, not in actual secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Confidence 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk is minimal; no actual secrets are embedded. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0, Confidence 1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), reflecting minimal risk due to potential for misuse of credential structures, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment**\n\nGiven the code snippet and the reports:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, structural risk; no actual secrets or vulnerabilities.\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code. The slight security risk score accounts for the potential misuse of credential structures but does not reflect an actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is justified, considering the potential (but not actual) misuse of credential structures in a larger context.",
