  "purpose": "Define types and constants for handling SIP headers, socket connections, and credentials in a network application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines types, constants, and data structures without input reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or written.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior. The credential data structures are flexible but do not contain hardcoded secrets or obvious backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and constants related to network socket handling and credential storage for a SIP-like protocol. It uses type hints for clarity and safety. No input/output operations, no data processing, no cryptographic or network communication code, and no potential malicious logic are present. The credential structures are flexible and allow for optional and callable password retrieval, which is standard for secure credential handling. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward type and constant setup without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, setting up data types and constants for use elsewhere. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
