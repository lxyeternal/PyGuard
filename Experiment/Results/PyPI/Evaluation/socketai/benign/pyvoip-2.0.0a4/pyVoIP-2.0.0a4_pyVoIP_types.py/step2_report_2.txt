  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is purely type annotations, constants, and data structure definitions.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The use of Callable for password retrieval is standard practice.\n- No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code only defines types and constants related to socket handling and credentials, with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no data flow or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no executable logic, no secrets.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** The only potential concern is the storage of sensitive data in the credential structures, but no actual secrets are present.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is a safe setup.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, purely structural with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** The highest assigned is 0.1, which is appropriate given the context—these are type definitions and constants, not active code.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to potential misinterpretation of credential storage, but no actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scoring aligns well with the analysis.",
