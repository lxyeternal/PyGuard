{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and constants for network communication, security credentials, and headers in a Python application handling sockets and SSL connections.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input; primarily defining data types and constants.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data stored in CREDENTIALS_DICT, KEY_PASSWORD, or used in socket/SSL operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; the code sets up type hints and constants but does not perform data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the structure suggests future use of credentials but currently contains no sensitive information or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and constants for socket and SSL operations, including a dictionary structure for credentials. It does not include any data processing, input reading, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The credential structures are generic and do not contain hardcoded secrets. Overall, the code appears to be part of a larger, security-aware application setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, preparatory setup for network and security credential management. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
