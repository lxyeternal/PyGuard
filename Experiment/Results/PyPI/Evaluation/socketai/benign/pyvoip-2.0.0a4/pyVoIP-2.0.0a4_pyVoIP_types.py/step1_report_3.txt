  "purpose": "Define type aliases and constants for handling socket connections and credentials in a network application.",
  "sources": "None (no data input sources) — all definitions are static type annotations and constants.",
  "sinks": "None (no data flow or untrusted data handling) — code consists of type definitions and constants only.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The credential-related type definitions are flexible but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various type annotations and constants related to socket handling and credential storage. The use of Callable in KEY_PASSWORD allows dynamic password retrieval, which is common in secure applications. No executable logic, input handling, or data processing is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure appears to be part of a larger application, serving as a type and constant definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type annotations and constants for socket and credential management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a benign, structural component of a larger system.",
