  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve credentials (username and password) for different servers, realms, and users.",
  "sources": "User inputs for add() method parameters (username, password, server, realm, user).",
  "sinks": "The credentials stored in the internal dictionary, which could be used elsewhere; no direct external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in a nested dictionary structure; retrieval occurs via lookup in this nested structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no external network activity or system modification; the credentials are stored in memory only.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a credential management class with methods to add and retrieve credentials based on server, realm, and user keys. It uses nested dictionaries to organize credentials. No input validation or encryption is present, but this is typical for a simple credential store. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The class does not send data externally, access system resources maliciously, or execute code dynamically. It appears to be a straightforward credential management implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard credential storage class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It stores credentials in-memory, which is typical, and does not perform any suspicious operations. The overall security risk is low.",
