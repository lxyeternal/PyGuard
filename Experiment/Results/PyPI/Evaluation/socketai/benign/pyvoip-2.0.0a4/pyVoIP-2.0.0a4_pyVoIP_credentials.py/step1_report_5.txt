  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve credentials for servers, realms, and users in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "Credentials are stored and retrieved from the self.credentials dictionary; input parameters include username, password, server, realm, user.",
  "sinks": "Returning credentials from get() method; credentials are stored as dictionaries; no direct data leaks or external calls occur within this code.",
  "flows": "add() method stores credentials in nested dictionaries based on server, realm, user; get() method retrieves credentials based on provided server, realm, user parameters, with fallback to defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code handles credentials in memory without external I/O or suspicious processing.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods to add and retrieve credentials using nested dictionaries. The credentials are stored in plain memory, which is typical for such a manager class. No external data sources, network calls, or code execution occurs. The get() method provides fallback logic with default credentials as per RFC 3261, which is standard. The code does not handle secrets insecurely beyond normal in-memory storage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward credentials management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It stores and retrieves credentials in memory without external interactions or malicious code. Overall, it is safe based on this snippet.",
