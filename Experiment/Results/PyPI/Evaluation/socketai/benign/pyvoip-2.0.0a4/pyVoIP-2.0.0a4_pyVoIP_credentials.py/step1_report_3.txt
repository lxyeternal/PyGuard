  "purpose": "Manage credentials for servers, realms, and users, allowing addition and retrieval of authentication details.",
  "sources": "Input data: credentials stored in the self.credentials dictionary. No external input sources in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing credential data; no external data output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Credentials are added to self.credentials via add() method; retrieved via get() method. No external flow of untrusted data outside of internal storage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of potentially sensitive credential data stored in plain dictionaries; no encryption or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CredentialsManager class that securely manages credentials in memory. It stores credentials in nested dictionaries, with optional keys for server, realm, and user. The add() method inserts credentials, while get() retrieves them based on the provided identifiers. There are no external data sources, network connections, or encryption mechanisms. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or external data exfiltration. It simply handles in-memory credential storage and retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard credential management utility with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It stores credentials in plain text within internal data structures, which could be a security concern in real-world applications, but does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior within this context.",
