  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward credential management class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk. The low security risk score reflects in-memory plaintext storage, which is typical for such utilities but should be secured in production environments. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
