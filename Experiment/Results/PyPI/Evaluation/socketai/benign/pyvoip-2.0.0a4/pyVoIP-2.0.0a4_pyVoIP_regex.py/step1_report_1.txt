{
  "purpose": "This module is designed to compile and store regex patterns used in pyVoIP for efficient pattern matching throughout the application.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own source for regex pattern definitions and the import of the re module.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or outputs in this code segment; it solely defines regex patterns for internal use.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only compiles regex patterns at startup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation are present. Regex patterns appear standard and relevant to SIP/SDP parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the re module, defines several regex patterns for SIP and SDP parsing, and compiles them once for efficiency. The patterns seem designed for typical SIP URI parsing, display name extraction, and SDP splitting. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears straightforward and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard, safe implementation of regex pattern compilation for SIP/SDP parsing in pyVoIP. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
