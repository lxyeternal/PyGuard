{
  "purpose": "This module pre-compiles regex patterns used in pyVoIP for SIP and SDP message parsing to improve efficiency by avoiding recompilation.",
  "sources": "The regex patterns are compiled at module load time; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external outputs; the code only defines regex objects for internal use.",
  "flows": "The code defines regex patterns; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The regex patterns are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module and defines several compiled regex patterns for SIP/SDP parsing, including AUTH_MATCH, VIA_SPLIT, TO_FROM_MATCH, TO_FROM_DIRECT_MATCH, and SDP_A_SPLIT. All patterns are static, compiled once, and intended for internal use. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The regex patterns are standard for SIP/SDP message processing. The code is purely declarative, serving as a utility for performance optimization. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or vulnerabilities are present. The regex patterns are well-formed and relevant for their purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for regex compilation in pyVoIP, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
