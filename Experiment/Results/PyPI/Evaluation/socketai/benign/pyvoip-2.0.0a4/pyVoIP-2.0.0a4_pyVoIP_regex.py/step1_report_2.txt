{
  "purpose": "To compile and store commonly used regex patterns for parsing SIP and SDP data in the pyVoIP project, optimizing regex usage by compiling once at startup.",
  "sources": "Regex patterns are defined directly in the code; no external input or data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths to untrusted input are present; the code only defines static regex patterns.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply initializes compiled regex objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed. The regex patterns appear standard and well-formed for SIP/SDP parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several compiled regex patterns for parsing SIP headers and SDP segments. No input reading, data processing, or dynamic execution occurs. The patterns are static and do not incorporate external or untrusted data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. The purpose is solely to optimize regex usage in a VoIP application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured regex compilation module intended for performance optimization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
