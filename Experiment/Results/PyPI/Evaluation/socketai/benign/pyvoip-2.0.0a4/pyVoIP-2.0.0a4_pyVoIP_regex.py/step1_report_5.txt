  "purpose": "This module pre-compiles regex patterns used in pyVoIP for parsing SIP and SDP data.",
  "sources": "Reads regex pattern definitions for SIP and SDP parsing, with no input data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; regex patterns are compiled and stored for later use.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this code only defines and compiles regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Regex patterns seem purpose-specific and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module and pre-compiles several regex patterns for SIP and SDP parsing tasks. Patterns include matching authentication info, SIP headers, and SDP segments. The code is purely declarative, setting up regex objects for later use, with no data processing or untrusted input handling within this snippet. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious data handling. The patterns appear to be intended for legitimate SIP message parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines pre-compiled regex patterns for SIP and SDP message parsing, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module supporting the larger pyVoIP project.",
