  "purpose": "Define a NAT helper class for resolving hostnames and determining if a host is local or remote within a network.",
  "sources": "Reading input hostnames/strings, resolving hostnames via socket.gethostbyname.",
  "sinks": "Potentially resolving untrusted hostnames; returning hostnames and IP addresses based on input.",
  "flows": "Input host strings -> ipaddress.ip_address or socket.gethostbyname -> return hostname or IP check -> AddressType determination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code performs standard IP resolution and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to handle IP addresses and hostnames. It includes exception handling for hostname resolution failures, raising a custom NATError. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present. The use of socket.gethostbyname is typical for hostname resolution, and the flow for determining local or remote is straightforward. The logic appears to be standard network address handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical NAT helper class with standard IP resolution and address classification. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
