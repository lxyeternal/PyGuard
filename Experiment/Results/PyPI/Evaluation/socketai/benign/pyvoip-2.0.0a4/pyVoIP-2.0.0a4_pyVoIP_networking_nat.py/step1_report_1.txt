{
  "purpose": "Provide NAT traversal functionality by resolving hostnames and determining if a host is local or remote.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname inputs, socket.gethostbyname for DNS resolution, and IP address conversions.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket.gethostbyname, which resolves hostnames to IP addresses, potentially exposing DNS resolution process.",
  "flows": "Hostname input -> DNS resolution (socket.gethostbyname) -> IP address parsing and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious data leaks or hidden behaviors. The code performs standard network resolution and comparison.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling NAT scenarios with methods to resolve hostnames and determine local/remote status. It relies on socket.gethostbyname for DNS resolution, which is typical. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The IP validation and resolution steps are straightforward, with appropriate exception handling. No suspicious data transmission or backdoors are evident. The code performs expected networking operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for NAT management without malicious behavior. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. It performs standard hostname resolution and IP checks.",
