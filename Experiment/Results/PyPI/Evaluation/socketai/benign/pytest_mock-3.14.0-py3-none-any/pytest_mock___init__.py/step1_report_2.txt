  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used; no data output, network, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Imports from 'pytest_mock.plugin' flow into the local namespace and the __all__ list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports modules and defines an alias and an export list. There is no data processing, network activity, or execution of external code. The code structure is typical for a module that consolidates imports for easier access. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that re-exports components from 'pytest_mock.plugin' for use in testing environments. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
