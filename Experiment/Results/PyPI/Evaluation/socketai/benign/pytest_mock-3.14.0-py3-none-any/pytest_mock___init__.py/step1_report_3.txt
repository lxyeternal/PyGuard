{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports specific components from the pytest_mock.plugin module for easier access and backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest_mock.plugin, specifically importing various classes, functions, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no output, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Imports are directly assigned or re-exported, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code primarily consists of imports and re-exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components from pytest_mock.plugin and assigns one for backward compatibility. It then declares an __all__ list for controlled exports. There are no functions, no runtime execution, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. It appears to be standard module setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward re-export module for pytest_mock.plugin components, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It contains no malware, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code.",
