{
  "purpose": "This code imports various components from the pytest_mock.plugin module and defines an export list for use in other modules or tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest_mock.plugin, specifically importing classes, functions, and warnings related to mocking in pytest.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining an export list; no data flow to external systems or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard import and export definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and a backward-compatibility alias. It defines an export list for module exports. There are no indications of data handling, external communication, or malicious constructs. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python module designed to re-export components.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign module for re-exporting pytest_mock.plugin components. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
