  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes and functions from the pytest_mock.plugin module for easier import and backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pytest_mock.plugin and the assignment of MockFixture.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data could cause harm; the code only performs imports and a simple variable assignment.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code is standard module setup and re-exporting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions from the pytest_mock.plugin module, then creates an alias for backward compatibility. All operations are standard for a Python module that re-exports symbols. No dynamic code execution, no network communication, no data leakage, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup for re-exporting symbols, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
