{
  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes and functions from pytest_mock.plugin for easier access and backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pytest_mock.plugin, referencing various classes, functions, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from a well-known testing library and defines an alias for backward compatibility. It only exports selected symbols via __all__. No data processing, external communications, or potential security risks are present. The code appears benign, primarily serving as a module re-export without executing any logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard re-export module for pytest_mock.plugin components. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and purely structural.",
