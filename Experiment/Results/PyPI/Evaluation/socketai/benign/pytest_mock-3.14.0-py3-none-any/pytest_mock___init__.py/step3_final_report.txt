{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from the 'pytest_mock.plugin' module, creates an alias for backward compatibility, and defines an export list for module consumers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pytest_mock.plugin', alias assignment 'MockFixture = MockerFixture', and the '__all__' list declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs static imports and aliasing without external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Imports and alias assignment flow into the '__all__' list, with no dynamic or external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with only import statements, an alias, and an export list, indicating standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setup for re-exporting symbols from 'pytest_mock.plugin'. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The alias 'MockFixture' is a simple backward compatibility measure. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are present. The code functions solely as a structural utility for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for re-exporting symbols from 'pytest_mock.plugin'. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the analysis confirms its safety.",
