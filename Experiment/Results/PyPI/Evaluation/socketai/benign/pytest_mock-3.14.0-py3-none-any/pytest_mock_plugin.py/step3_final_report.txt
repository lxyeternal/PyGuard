  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive mocking and patching utility for pytest, managing mock objects, patches, and assertion wrappers to facilitate testing and reporting.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules, pytest, internal utility functions, and get_mock_module() for dynamic mock management.",
  "sinks": "Creates and manages mock objects, applies patches, wraps assertions, and handles cleanup without external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Configuration and setup via get_mock_module(), patch application through internal patcher classes, assertion wrapping functions, and cleanup routines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard testing infrastructure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured testing utility designed to manage mocks and enhance assertion reporting in pytest. It does not perform any external communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The functions and classes serve to facilitate mock lifecycle management, patching, and assertion wrapping, all within the context of test execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is consistent with standard testing practices and is safe for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard pytest mocking utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. Its malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting its role as a testing infrastructure component.",
