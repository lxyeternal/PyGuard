  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no data leaks or dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Setting version variables directly from hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a conditional TYPE_CHECKING block for type annotations; no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard autogenerated version file from setuptools_scm. It assigns static version data to variables, with type-checking support. There are no sources of untrusted data, no dangerous sinks, or suspicious flows. The code is minimal, straightforward, and consistent with common version management practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, auto-generated version definition file. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
