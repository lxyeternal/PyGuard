{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and sets version variables accordingly.",
  "sources": "The code assigns static version strings and constructs version tuples, with no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; all variables are assigned static or derived values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing constructs and defines version-related variables. The version string and tuple are statically assigned, indicating they are generated during build time, not runtime user input. There are no data inputs, network operations, or external data handling. The structure is simple, with no complex logic, loops, or dynamic execution. It is typical of versioning boilerplate code created by setuptools_scm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard version metadata with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for version management.",
