  "purpose": "This code is generated by setuptools_scm to define version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines static variables for version info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to a leak or execution effect.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains standard version variable definitions with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, including a version string and a tuple, based on static assignments. It includes conditional typing annotations but does not process external input or perform any operations that could be malicious. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version info assignment generated by setuptools_scm. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
