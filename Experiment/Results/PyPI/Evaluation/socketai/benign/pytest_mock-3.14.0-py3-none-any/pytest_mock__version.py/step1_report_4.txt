{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and does not perform any runtime operations beyond setting version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static definitions",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, input/output, or external data transmission occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only initializes variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward version metadata assignment with no suspicious constructs or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard versioning snippet generated by setuptools_scm, containing no user input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive processing. It conditionally defines version tuples based on type checking, then assigns fixed version information. There are no obfuscated elements, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely for version metadata management, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
