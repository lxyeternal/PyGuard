{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a static version metadata snippet generated by setuptools_scm, used for version management in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional type annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data or perform any security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and auto-generated boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version info file with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious logic. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples, with conditional typing support. No external inputs, network activity, or data processing occurs. The code's purpose is purely version management, typical of setuptools_scm outputs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence level is 1, as the analysis aligns perfectly with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and auto-generated for versioning, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
