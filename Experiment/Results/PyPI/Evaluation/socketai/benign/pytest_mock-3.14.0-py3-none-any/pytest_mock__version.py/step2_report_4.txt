  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional type annotations.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external data, network operations, or data processing.\n   - The code does not perform any runtime logic beyond variable assignment.\n\n2. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for version management, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The overall assessment in all reports is consistent: benign, auto-generated, and safe.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; all reports correctly state that the code is benign.\n   - There are no assumptions that lead to false positives or negatives.\n\n5. **Score Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The malware score of 0 aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified, given the absence of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is auto-generated by a well-known tool (setuptools_scm), it is unlikely to contain malicious payloads.\n   - The static assignment of version variables is standard practice and poses no security threat.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and unobfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no security concerns. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the nature of the code.",
