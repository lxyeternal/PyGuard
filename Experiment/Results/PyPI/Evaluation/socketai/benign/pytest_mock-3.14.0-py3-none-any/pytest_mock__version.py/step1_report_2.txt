  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints, no suspicious code or backdoors; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables for a Python package, including conditional typing support. It uses standard Python idioms for versioning, with no external input, no sensitive data handling, and no malicious constructs. The code appears to be auto-generated by a packaging tool and does not perform any operations beyond defining version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign auto-generated version definition, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
