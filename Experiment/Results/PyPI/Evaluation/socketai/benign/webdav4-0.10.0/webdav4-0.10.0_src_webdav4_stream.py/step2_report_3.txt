  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements HTTP streaming with support for range requests, retries, and a file-like interface.\n- Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or hardcoded credentials.\n- Handles errors gracefully.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as utilities for streaming files over HTTP, with retries and range support.\n- **Analysis:** Finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. The low risk score aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above; details streaming with seeking and chunked reading.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, standard network handling, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. The code is standard and safe.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, streaming responses, handling chunks, file-like interface.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; network interactions are typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code's content.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar functionality; supports range requests, retries.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious signs; standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Utilities for streaming over HTTP, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, standard approach; no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correctly low risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same or similar code, which is a standard HTTP streaming utility.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code segments or techniques.\n- **Risk score:** The majority of reports assign a low risk (~0.2), which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Scores consistency:** All are consistent with the code's functionality and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal risk, mainly due to network operations, which are standard for such utilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented HTTP streaming utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate, but I would lower the risk slightly from 0.2 to 0.1 to reflect the low-risk nature more accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the benign nature of the code.",
