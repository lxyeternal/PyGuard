{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for streaming files over HTTP, including range requests, retries, and a file-like interface.",
  "sources": "HTTP responses, network request functions, response headers, response iter_bytes method.",
  "sinks": "Data chunks yielded from response, potential network data flow, no direct data leaks or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "request() generates HTTPResponse; iter_url() manages response and retries; IterStream uses iter_url to provide a file-like stream interface.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard error handling and resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HTTP streaming utility with support for range requests, retries, and a file-like interface. It uses common libraries and practices, handles network errors gracefully, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The network interactions are typical for such utilities, and no suspicious data flows or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP streaming utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses minimal security risk, primarily due to network operations, which are typical for this functionality. The overall assessment aligns with the provided reports, confirming the code's safety.",
