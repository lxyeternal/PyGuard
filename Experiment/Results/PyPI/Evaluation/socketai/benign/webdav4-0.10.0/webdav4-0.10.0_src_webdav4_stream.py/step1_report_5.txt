{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for streaming file responses over HTTP, including request handling, iterating over chunks, and creating a file-like object for streaming.",
  "sources": "Reads data from HTTP responses, request parameters, and input file objects.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from responses to generate chunks; does not directly write or output untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data flows into iterators and the file-like object; user input can influence request headers and seek positions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. No malicious code or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation for streaming HTTP data with features like range requests, chunked reading, and file-like interface. No suspicious external calls, code injections, or data leaks are present. All external data sources are HTTP responses or method parameters, and no code manipulates environment variables or performs unsafe operations. The handling of network errors and response management appears standard and secure. The code avoids dangerous practices like eval or dynamic code execution, and it does not contain obfuscated segments. It mainly relies on standard libraries and explicit method calls, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure, intended for streaming HTTP responses with proper resource management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It is a typical implementation for a streaming client library.",
