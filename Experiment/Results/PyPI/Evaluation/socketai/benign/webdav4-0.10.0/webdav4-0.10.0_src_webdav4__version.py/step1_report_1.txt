{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or places where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; code is straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables, including version string and tuple, based on static values. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hinting. No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version metadata script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for package versioning.",
