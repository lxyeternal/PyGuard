{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for version tracking and management.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables assigned directly within the code, specifically version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data inputs, outputs, or untrusted data handling points in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional type checking blocks, but these are standard for version management scripts. No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script declares version-related variables and handles type checking via a conditional block. The version string is hardcoded to '0.10.0' and assigned to multiple variables, which is typical for version modules. No data input/output, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure aligns with standard version declaration practices in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated version declaration script with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any external data handling or operations that could be malicious.",
