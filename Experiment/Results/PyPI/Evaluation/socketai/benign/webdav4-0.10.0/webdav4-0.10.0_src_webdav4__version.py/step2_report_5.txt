  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and verify their claims against the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward, auto-generated version module.\n- It assigns static version string and tuple variables.\n- It uses a standard `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional for type hints.\n- No external data input, network calls, or dynamic execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n   **No.** The code is simple, static, and typical for version management. All reports correctly identify this.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n   **No.** The reports accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior. They correctly note the absence of malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, and security risk?**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.  \n   - These are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n   - No. The reports avoid assumptions; they focus on static analysis and standard practices.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores with the code?**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct. No malicious code, network activity, or external data handling.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk (0):** Correct. No vulnerabilities or risky behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is standard boilerplate for versioning, generated by a common tool (`setuptools_scm`), and contains no malicious or risky elements.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Aspect          | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0      |\n| Security Risk   | 0      |\n\nThese align with the reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, static, and standard.\n- All reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final note:** This code is safe, with no security concerns.",
