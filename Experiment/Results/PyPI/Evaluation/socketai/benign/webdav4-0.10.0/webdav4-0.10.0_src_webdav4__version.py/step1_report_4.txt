{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, including version strings and tuples, primarily for package management and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version tuple variables, with no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static version information.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally defines type hints and assigns version-related variables. All data is hardcoded and static. No external input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The purpose is purely for version tracking, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version definition snippet for package metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
