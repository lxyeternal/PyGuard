  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the actual code, and then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a straightforward, auto-generated versioning module for a Python package.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- It uses standard conditional type checking with `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- There are no external data inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, secret leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code contains no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware potential:** Zero; the code is purely static assignment.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** None; it’s a benign version declaration.\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, standard boilerplate, with no malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify that there are no external inputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs.\n- Their confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.\n- Their malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are all 0, aligning with the actual code.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No flaws are evident in any report. They are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning is sound: static, generated code with no malicious features.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The assigned scores seem reasonable and justified.\n- Since the code is purely static and benign, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Given the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments.\n- No further suspicion or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on a detailed review, I agree with the provided reports' conclusions. The code is a benign, auto-generated versioning snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the reports and the code’s nature.",
