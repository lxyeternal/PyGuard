  "purpose": "Static version management variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version string and tuple variables; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; static assignments do not lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, generated boilerplate with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version info module with standard type checking. It contains no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's purpose is purely for version metadata, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and standard boilerplate for versioning. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
