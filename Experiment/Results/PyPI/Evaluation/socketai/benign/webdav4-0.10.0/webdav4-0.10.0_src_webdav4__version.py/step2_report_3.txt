  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, auto-generated version metadata script.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any issues or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate code.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports assign zero, which is accurate.\n- **Data flow, sinks, sources:** None exist; static assignments only.\n- **Errors or mistakes in reports:** No, the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified; no malicious activity.\n- The **security risk** score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities.\n- The **obfuscated** score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n\n### Potential points of critique:\n- The reports uniformly give a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound; no assumptions or overreach.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is standard versioning boilerplate, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are correct. No changes needed. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scoring is appropriate, and there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.",
