  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm for version control management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it assigns static version information within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns static values to version variables; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines versioning information for a package, including version string and tuple representations. It uses conditional type checking but does not execute any untrusted code or external input. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code appears standard for version management and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward versioning module generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and primarily serves package version management.",
