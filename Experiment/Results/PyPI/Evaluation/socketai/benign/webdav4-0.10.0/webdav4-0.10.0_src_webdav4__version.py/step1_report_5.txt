  "purpose": "This code is generated by setuptools_scm to manage version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Version string assignment (__version__), tuple assignment (__version_tuple__ and version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to __version__ and version variables, and tuple assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward version metadata assignment with no hidden or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is boilerplate for managing version information, defining version as a string and a tuple, with conditional import logic for type checking. There are no external input reads, no data leaks, or malicious logic. The purpose is solely to store version data. No suspicious activity or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code's intent is transparent and safe.",
