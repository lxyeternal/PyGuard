  "purpose": "Provides an fsspec-compliant interface to WebDAV, enabling filesystem operations over a WebDAV server.",
  "sources": "Client.info, client.ls, client.remove, client.copy, client.move, client.mkdir, client.created, client.modified, client.etag, client.content_length, client.open, client.upload_fileobj",
  "sinks": "Remote server via client methods for file and directory operations, including uploads, copies, deletions, and info retrieval.",
  "flows": "Local method calls (e.g., ls, info, cp_file) invoke client methods; data flows from local buffers/files to remote server during uploads, and from remote during reads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or covert channels detected. Exception translation is standard. No unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an fsspec WebDAV filesystem wrapper. It delegates core operations to an external Client class, with exception translation for common filesystem errors. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The code handles remote file operations securely and efficiently, with proper error handling. External dependencies are presumed trustworthy; static analysis shows no signs of sabotage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured WebDAV filesystem interface with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It maintains standard security practices and does not contain obfuscation or secrets. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of the external Client class.",
