There are no indications of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only potentially unusual element is the modification of the Python path, which is common in local documentation setups but warrants attention in security-sensitive contexts. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.
