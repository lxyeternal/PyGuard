{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for repeating, retrying, and wrapping functions, typically used for handling function execution patterns.",
  "sources": "User-provided functions passed into repeat_func, retry, and wrap_fn.",
  "targets": "Execution of provided functions; no direct data leaks or external data access present.",
  "flows": "Function inputs (callables) flow into wrapped or repeated executions; no untrusted data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses sleep for retry delays, which is normal. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: repeat_func repeatedly calls a function, retry decorates functions to retry on specified exceptions with optional delays, and wrap_fn creates zero-argument callables from functions with arguments. All functions use standard Python modules and patterns without suspicious behavior. No external data sources, no code injection, no data leakage, and no signs of malicious intent. The use of time.sleep is benign and typical for retry logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module providing function handling capabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It performs standard patterns for retries and function wrapping without suspicious activity.",
