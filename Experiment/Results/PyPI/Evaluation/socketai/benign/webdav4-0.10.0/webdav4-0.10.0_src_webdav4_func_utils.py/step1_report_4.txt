{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for repeating, retrying, and wrapping callables, mainly for functional programming and control flow management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'func', 'errors', 'timeout', 'filter_errors', 'args', and 'kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the provided 'func' and 'timeout' functions, potentially leading to code execution or delays.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> wrapped functions -> calls to 'func()' and 'timeout()' -> control flow based on try-except and retries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of time.sleep for retries is typical control flow, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for repeated execution ('repeat_func'), retry logic ('retry'), and function wrapping ('wrap_fn'). The retry function supports configurable backoff via 'timeout' and error filtering, with control flow based on exceptions. All functions perform standard control flow operations without external or hidden data exfiltration, no code injection, and no suspicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious intent detected. The functions are safe, generic, and do not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for function control flow management with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured, clear, and lacks any indicators of malware or security risks.",
