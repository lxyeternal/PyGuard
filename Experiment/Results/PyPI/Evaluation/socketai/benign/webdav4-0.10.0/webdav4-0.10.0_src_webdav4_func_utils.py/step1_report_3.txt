  "purpose": "Utility functions for repeated function calls, retries with error handling, and function wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., func, retries, errors, timeout, filter_errors, args, kwargs).",
  "sinks": "Function execution points, especially within retry and wrap_fn functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions are used in control logic and function calls; retry executes the passed function multiple times; wrap_fn calls the original function with preset arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses time.sleep() for retries, which is common and not malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: repeat_func repeatedly calls a function, retry decorates a function to retry on specified errors with optional delay, and wrap_fn wraps a function with preset arguments. All functions perform typical utility roles with no external network, file, or sensitive data handling. The retry function introduces a sleep delay which is standard for retry logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides standard utility functions for retry and function wrapping without any malicious intent. No signs of malware or security risks are present. The functions are safe and do not perform any harmful operations.",
