  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Reports 1 & 2:** Both conclude the code is benign, with high confidence (1), no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. They emphasize the use of standard library modules, typical retry logic, and function wrapping without suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Report 3:** Slightly lower confidence (0.95), notes a minor security risk score (0.1), but still finds no malware or malicious intent. It emphasizes standard patterns and no external data handling.\n\n- **Report 4:** Confidence 0.9, security risk 0.2, but again finds no malicious activity, emphasizing the standard control flow and lack of suspicious code.\n\n- **Report 5:** Full confidence (1), security risk 0, no malware, no obfuscation, straightforward utility functions.\n\n**Confirmations & Concerns:**\n\n- **Code correctness & behavior:** All reports agree that the code is straightforward utility functions for repeated calls, retries, and wrapping. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and transparency.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, with some reports assigning small scores (0.1 or 0.2), but these are justified as the use of `time.sleep()` in retry logic is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are identified. The code appears well-structured.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- Given the analysis, the malware score should be **0** across the board, which is consistent.\n\n- The obfuscated score is correctly **0**; no obfuscation detected.\n\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- The only slight concern could be the use of `time.sleep()` in retry logic, which is standard but could be exploited if misused in a malicious context. However, in this context, it’s benign.\n\n- No external data handling, no network activity, no secret data, no code injection, or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very conservative, minimal risk, mainly due to the retry delay pattern, which is standard)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a set of standard utility functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward utility functions and the lack of any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
