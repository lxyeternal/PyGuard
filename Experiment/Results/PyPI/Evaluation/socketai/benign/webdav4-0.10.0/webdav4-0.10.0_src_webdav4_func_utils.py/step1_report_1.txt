  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for repeated function calls, retry logic, and function wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'func', 'errors', 'timeout', 'filter_errors', and wrapped functions.",
  "sinks": "Return values of the utility functions; potential sleep durations; exception handling for retries.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to internal logic; exception handling and retries are based on caught exceptions; sleep durations depend on 'timeout' parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are observed. The functions perform typical utility operations without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: 'repeat_func' calls a function repeatedly, 'retry' provides retry logic with exception handling and optional delay, 'wrap_fn' converts functions into zero-argument callables. All functions perform standard operations with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity detected. The use of sleep in 'retry' is typical for retries and does not indicate malicious intent. The code relies on standard library modules and well-understood patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions used for repetitive execution, retry mechanisms, and function wrapping. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears straightforward and safe.",
