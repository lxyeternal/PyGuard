{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for repeated function calls, retry mechanisms with exception filtering and delays, and function wrapping with preset arguments.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters; no external data sources or user inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data outputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through control structures; no external network or file I/O; no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; use of sleep is standard for retries.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions: 'repeat_func' for repeated calls, 'retry' for retrying functions with exception filtering and delays, and 'wrap_fn' for wrapping functions with preset arguments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of sleep in retry logic is typical and benign. No external network activity, data leaks, or code injection detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward utility code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
