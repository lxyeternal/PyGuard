  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The functions perform standard utility operations: repeated calls, retries with delays, and function wrapping.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic:**  \n   - `repeat_func`: Calls a function repeatedly, potentially infinitely if `times` is None. No suspicious patterns here.  \n   - `retry`: Implements retry logic with exception filtering and optional delays via `sleep`. This is a common pattern for robustness, not malicious.  \n   - `wrap_fn`: Wraps a function with preset arguments into a zero-argument callable. Standard functional programming utility.\n\n3. **Potential Risks or Anomalies:**  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.  \n   - Use of `time.sleep()` is typical for retries, not indicative of malicious activity.  \n   - No external network, file I/O, or data exfiltration observed.  \n   - No dynamic code execution or suspicious control flow.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.  \n   - **Security risk:** All reports are at or near 0, with minor variations (0.1, 0.2), but none justify a higher score since no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Overestimations:**  \n   - The highest security risk score is 0.2, which is reasonable given the use of sleep in retry logic, but this is standard and not risky.  \n   - No report suggests any reason to elevate the risk score beyond 0.5.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   Based on the detailed analysis, the code is a standard utility module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk) — the use of sleep in retries is typical and does not elevate risk.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and typical of utility functions. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and do not require adjustments.",
