{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for repeating function calls, retry logic with error handling, and function wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments and exception instances; no external input sources or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or external communication; no file I/O, network, or system calls.",
  "flows": "The code flows from input parameters to function calls, error handling, and sleep delays, but no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or hidden backdoors. The retry mechanism uses sleep for delay but does not contain malicious logic. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for repeated execution, retries with error filtering and delays, and function wrapping. All components are standard and do not involve external data sources, secret handling, or network operations. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The use of sleep for delays is typical for retry mechanisms and not malicious. No obfuscation or covert behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module providing common function wrappers and retry logic. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
