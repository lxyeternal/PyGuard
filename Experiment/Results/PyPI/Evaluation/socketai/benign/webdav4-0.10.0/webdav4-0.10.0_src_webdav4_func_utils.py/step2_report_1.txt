  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions for repeated calls, retries, and wrapping functions.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The functions use standard patterns, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or external data handling.\n- The use of sleep for retries is typical and benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly describes benign utility functions.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent, straightforward utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 2:\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n### Report 3:\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but reasoning is consistent.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly overestimating, but given the retry delays and no external data, still low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Note:** No suspicious activity detected; the small risk score seems conservative.\n\n### Report 4:\n- Similar reasoning, slightly lower confidence (0.9).\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 — still low, considering the code is purely utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n### Report 5:\n- Complete agreement, full confidence (1).\n- Scores: all zero, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **Malware scores:** all reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** all 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** all very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code is entirely benign; the scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The minor differences in confidence and risk scores reflect the cautiousness of the reviewers but do not suggest any actual threat.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — standard utility functions with no security implications.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.",
