  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for parsing ISO 8601 and RFC 1123 datetime strings into datetime objects.",
  "sources": "User-provided datetime strings passed to 'fromisoformat' and 'from_rfc1123' functions.",
  "sinks": "Returned datetime objects; no data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input datetime strings flow through parsing functions, which convert them into datetime objects; no further data flow or external transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. Exception handling is generic but standard for fallback parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that parse datetime strings using 'dateutil.parser.parse' and 'email.utils.parsedate_to_datetime'. Exception handling is implemented to fallback to 'parse' if 'parsedate_to_datetime' fails, ensuring robustness. No user input is used insecurely, nor is there code that transmits or stores sensitive data. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present. The use of external libraries appears standard for datetime parsing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility functions for datetime parsing with proper exception handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
