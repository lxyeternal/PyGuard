  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing date strings in ISO 8601 and RFC 1123 formats.",
  "sources": "User-provided date string inputs passed to fromisoformat and from_rfc1123 functions.",
  "targets": "Parsing functions parse and parsedate_to_datetime which convert strings to datetime objects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are received by the functions, then passed to parsing functions; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling in from_rfc1123; no hardcoded credentials or hidden code; straightforward date parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple utility functions for date parsing. It employs standard library functions, with fallback in case of parsing failure. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior detected. Exception handling is broad but appropriate for this context and does not introduce security risks. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility for date parsing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
