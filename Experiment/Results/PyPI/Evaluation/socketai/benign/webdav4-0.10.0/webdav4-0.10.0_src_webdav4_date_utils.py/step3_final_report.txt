  "purpose": "Utility functions to parse date strings into datetime objects, supporting ISO 8601 and RFC 1123 formats.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'datetime_string' provided to 'fromisoformat' and 'from_rfc1123'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; functions only parse input strings.",
  "flows": "Input 'datetime_string' flows into parsing functions, with fallback from 'parsedate_to_datetime' to 'parse'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; broad exception handling in 'from_rfc1123' is standard fallback, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for date parsing with appropriate exception handling. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The functions perform straightforward parsing tasks without data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The exception handling provides fallback parsing, which is common practice. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are involved. The code's simplicity and use of trusted libraries indicate a benign purpose, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for date parsing with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
