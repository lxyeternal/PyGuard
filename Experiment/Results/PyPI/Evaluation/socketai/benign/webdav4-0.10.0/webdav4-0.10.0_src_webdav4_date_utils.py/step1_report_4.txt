{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing ISO 8601 and RFC 1123 datetime strings into datetime objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings through the function parameters 'datetime_string'.",
  "sinks": "The functions pass data to 'parse' and 'parsedate_to_datetime' from external libraries which could process untrusted data, but these are standard parsing functions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are taken from function arguments and passed directly to external parsing functions without validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The exception handling is broad but normal for fallback parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses well-known libraries to parse datetime strings. The functions handle errors gracefully by falling back to alternate parsing methods. No suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. External library functions are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no signs of data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. Overall, this appears to be straightforward utility code with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility for datetime parsing with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply wraps existing parsing functions with minimal error handling.",
