  "purpose": "Provide HTTP utility functions and a custom HTTP client with additional WebDAV methods.",
  "sources": "Imports (httpx library), method parameter in request function, class attribute definitions, constants for HTTP status codes.",
  "sinks": "Client.request method calls, class attributes invoking request functions, use of HTTP methods as strings.",
  "flows": "Method request functions invoke client.request with untrusted URL input; class attributes (e.g., propfind) call request functions, which ultimately call client.request with method and URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code is straightforward and uses standard HTTP methods and a well-known HTTP client library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of HTTP methods, a request function that creates method-specific request handlers, and extends httpx.Client with custom WebDAV methods. The code appears to be a standard implementation for HTTP utilities with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or malicious code injection is present. The BANDWIDTH_LIMIT_EXCEEDED constant is a typical status code representation, not malicious. All functions seem to be purely utility-based, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTTP utility module with extended methods for WebDAV. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided code fragment.",
