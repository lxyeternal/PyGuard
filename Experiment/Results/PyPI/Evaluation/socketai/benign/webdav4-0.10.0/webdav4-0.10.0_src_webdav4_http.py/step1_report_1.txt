{
  "purpose": "Provides HTTP utility functions, including custom HTTP methods and a client class for WebDAV operations.",
  "sources": "Imports external httpx library, type checking imports, and uses input parameters in request functions.",
  "sinks": "client.request method invocation which could send data over the network; no explicit sinks for untrusted data in the code.",
  "flows": "request method returned by request() is called with method, url, and kwargs; no complex data flow or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The request function is a wrapper around httpx.Client.request, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines HTTP methods and extends the httpx.Client with additional WebDAV methods via the request() factory function. No input sanitization or insecure handling of data is apparent. The BANDWIDTH_LIMIT_EXCEEDED constant is a status code and message, not malicious. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or unusual data handling was detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for HTTP and WebDAV operations. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It functions as a helper to extend httpx.Client with custom HTTP verbs without any suspicious behavior.",
