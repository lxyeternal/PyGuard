  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess the code for potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines HTTP method constants, a factory function to generate method-specific request functions, and extends `httpx.Client` with additional WebDAV methods.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code relies on the well-known `httpx` library, which is standard for HTTP operations.\n- The `BANDWIDTH_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` constant is a status code and message, not malicious.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or data leaks are detected.\n- The code appears to be a utility module for HTTP/WebDAV operations, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The `request` function creates method-specific functions that invoke `client.request` with the specified method and URL. This is a common pattern.\n- The extension of `httpx.Client` with additional WebDAV methods is straightforward and benign.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0), consistent with a utility module.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 or 1), indicating the reviewers believe the code is safe.\n\n**Potential concerns or assumptions:**\n\n- The code accepts external URL inputs and kwargs for requests, which could be misused if used maliciously, but this is typical for HTTP client code and not inherently malicious.\n- No input sanitization is present, but again, this is standard for HTTP request utilities; sanitization should be handled at a higher level.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, consistent with utility code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign utility module for HTTP and WebDAV operations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond typical considerations for network request code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or 0, if you prefer to be even more conservative)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' evaluations and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward extension of an HTTP client with WebDAV methods, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
