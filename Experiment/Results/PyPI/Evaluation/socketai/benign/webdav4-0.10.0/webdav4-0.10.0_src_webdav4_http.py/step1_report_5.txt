{
  "purpose": "Provide HTTP utilities and extended WebDAV methods using the httpx library.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as 'method', 'client', 'url', and 'kwargs'. No external untrusted sources are explicitly read in the code.",
  "sinks": "The 'client.request' method which executes HTTP requests; potential if untrusted 'url' or 'kwargs' are maliciously crafted, but typical in HTTP client code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'method', 'client', 'url', 'kwargs' flow into 'client.request' method via the 'request' function, which then performs an HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code merely extends httpx.Client with custom HTTP verbs, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines HTTP method constants, creates a request wrapper to extend client capabilities with WebDAV methods, and subclasses httpx.Client to include these methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. No external data sources or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for HTTP/WebDAV operations with no hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for HTTP and WebDAV requests. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no security risks are evident. The extension of the httpx.Client with additional HTTP methods is typical for web client implementations.",
