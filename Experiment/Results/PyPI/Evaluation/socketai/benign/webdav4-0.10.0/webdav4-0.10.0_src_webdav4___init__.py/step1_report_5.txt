{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports the version information for a WebDAV library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module file (.version) within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only imports version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; only a simple import statement with a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement for __version__ from a local version module and a comment. There is no user input, no external data handling, no dynamic execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The comment indicates the purpose of the module but does not introduce any suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is minimal and typical for a library version import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of version information, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It is standard boilerplate code for a Python package.",
