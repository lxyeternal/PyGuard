  "purpose": "Import the version information of the Webdav library module.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing __version__ from the local version module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; merely importing version info.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code patterns; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports the __version__ attribute from a local module named version. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, network activity, or system modifications. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The comment indicates it's part of a Webdav library, likely a standard version import statement. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement to access version information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
