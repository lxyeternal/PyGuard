  "purpose": "Import version information from a local module for package version management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.version' to import '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement importing '__version__' from a local module. It does not involve any input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for version management in Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1.0), as the code is simple and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
