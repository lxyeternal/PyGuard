{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions related to file handling, specifically importing a function from the httpx library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing peek_filelike_length from httpx._utils",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as the code only imports a utility function",
  "anomalies": "Imports a function from an internal module (_utils) of the httpx library, which is a private module, indicating potential unintended dependency or usage. No usage or invocation shown in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, importing a function from a third-party library's internal module. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data leakage, code injection, or malicious actions. The import of a private module (_utils) could be unconventional but does not necessarily imply malicious intent. No further code is provided to assess runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable point is the import from a private module, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.",
