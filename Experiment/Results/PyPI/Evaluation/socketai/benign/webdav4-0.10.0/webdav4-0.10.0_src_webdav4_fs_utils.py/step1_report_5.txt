  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for file handling, specifically importing a function from the httpx library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing peek_filelike_length from httpx._utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Importing from an internal module (_utils) which is typically intended as internal; no suspicious behavior in the import itself",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single utility function from the internal utils module of the httpx library. The import itself is benign, assuming standard library usage. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious operations are present. The use of internal modules (_utils) could indicate reliance on non-public API, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility import with no malicious intent. It does not contain malicious code or behavior, and the presence of an internal module import does not inherently suggest security issues.",
