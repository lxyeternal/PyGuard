  "purpose": "Import a utility function 'peek_filelike_length' from the internal '_utils' module of the 'httpx' library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'httpx._utils' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports a function without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "Import from internal module -> usage of 'peek_filelike_length' (not shown), but no data flow is present in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Importing from a private/internal module ('_utils') is unconventional and potentially risky for maintenance but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. The import from an internal module is discouraged but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reliance on internal modules could cause future compatibility issues but is not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, merely importing a utility function from an internal module. There is no malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The main concern is the use of a private module, which could cause maintenance issues but does not pose an immediate security threat.",
