{
  "purpose": "This code imports a utility function from the httpx library, likely for file-related operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'httpx._utils', specifically 'peek_filelike_length'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident as the code only performs an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The import of an internal utility from the 'httpx' library (underscore-prefixed module) could suggest reliance on non-public API, which might change and could be suspicious, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function from a third-party library, which is a common practice. The use of a private module ('_utils') could indicate a potential maintenance or compatibility risk, but it does not exhibit malicious behavior by itself. There are no other operations, data handling, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward import of a utility function from a third-party library. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues within this snippet. The reliance on a private module warrants caution but is not inherently malicious.",
