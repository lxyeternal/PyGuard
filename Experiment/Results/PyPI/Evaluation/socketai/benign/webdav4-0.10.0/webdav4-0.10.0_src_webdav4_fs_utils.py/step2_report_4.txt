  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue Present?** The report correctly identifies that the code only performs an import from a private module (`httpx._utils`). No runtime behavior, data flow, or malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report is accurate; it notes the import from a private module and the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. The confidence is 0.8, which seems reasonable given the minimal context.\n- **Assessment:** No changes needed. The import from a private module is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same as above, the code only imports a utility function from an internal module.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report correctly states that there's no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. Given the benign nature, a security risk of 0.1 might be slightly high but acceptable considering reliance on internal modules.\n- **Assessment:** The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same as previous; import from internal `_utils`.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report appropriately notes the reliance on internal modules and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. This seems consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same as above.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Correctly notes the import from internal module and benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. Reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same as others.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** Accurate assessment.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement.\n- The use of an internal module (`httpx._utils`) is consistently flagged as unconventional but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior in the code snippets.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with slight variations in confidence and security risk scores, which are reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on internal modules, a small security risk score (~0.1) is justified, but overall, the risk remains very low.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to reliance on internal modules, which could pose maintenance or compatibility issues but are not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No malicious activity or security risks are evident in this code snippet. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustments.",
