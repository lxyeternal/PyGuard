  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Snippet:**\n```python\n\"\"\"Common file utilities.\"\"\"\n\nfrom httpx._utils import (  # noqa: F401\n    peek_filelike_length,\n)\n```\n\n**Key observations:**\n- The code is a simple import statement.\n- It imports `peek_filelike_length` from the internal `_utils` module of the `httpx` library.\n- No functions, data flows, or runtime behaviors are present.\n- Importing from an internal module (`_utils`) is generally discouraged because internal modules are not part of the public API and may change without notice, but this is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the import from a private module.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the securityRisk is minimal, reflecting the internal module import concern.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity. The securityRisk score is slightly elevated due to reliance on internal modules, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes reliance on internal modules is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7 — reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, benign import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no malicious activity, just an internal import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern primarily due to reliance on internal modules.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The only notable point is the reliance on a private module (`_utils`) which is discouraged but not malicious.\n- The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — due to use of internal modules, which could cause maintenance issues but is not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are appropriate given the limited scope and nature of the code snippet. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Be cautious about importing from internal modules, as they may change or cause compatibility issues, but this does not constitute a security risk in this context.",
