  "purpose": "Setup pytest fixtures for optional 'yaml' module import and for creating various 'munch' objects with fixed parameters for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of 'yaml' within the fixture; creation of 'munch' class instances with fixed arguments, including a lambda function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Fixture invocation leads to import or object creation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a lambda function in fixture parameters; no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest fixtures: one for optionally importing 'yaml' and skipping tests if unavailable, and another for parametrized creation of 'munch' objects with fixed arguments, including a lambda. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate system files. The import handling is safe, and object creation is standard for test setups. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and controlled behavior indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test fixture setup with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe and straightforward implementation suitable for testing dependencies.",
