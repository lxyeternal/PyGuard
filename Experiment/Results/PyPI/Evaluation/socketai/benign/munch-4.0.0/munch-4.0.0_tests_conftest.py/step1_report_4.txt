{
  "purpose": "This code defines pytest fixtures to load the 'yaml' module and to generate various 'munch' objects for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'yaml' module import and the request parameters to instantiate 'munch' classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in the code; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules and creating 'munch' objects with fixed parameters, no untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard import and object instantiation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up test fixtures using pytest, conditionally importing the 'yaml' module and skipping tests if unavailable. It also creates 'munch' objects with fixed parameters for testing. No untrusted input, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard testing setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages imports and object creation for testing purposes without any harmful behavior.",
