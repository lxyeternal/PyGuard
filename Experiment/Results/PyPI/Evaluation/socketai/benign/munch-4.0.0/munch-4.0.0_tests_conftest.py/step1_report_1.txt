{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures to load the 'yaml' module and to generate various 'munch' objects for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'yaml' module during import within the 'yaml_module' fixture and reads the 'munch' library during fixture setup.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not write or execute untrusted data or perform actions that can lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The source in 'yaml_module' leads to an early return or a skipped test; the 'munch_obj' fixture creates instances of munch classes, which are used in tests but do not process external input directly.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code is straightforward fixture setup with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides fixtures for testing, with dynamic imports and class instantiation for 'munch' objects. The 'yaml' import is optional and safely handled with try-except. The 'munch_obj' fixture parametrizes different munch classes, passing fixed arguments, which are standard for test setups. No external inputs, malicious behaviors, or risky operations are present. The overall structure is typical for test code, and there are no signs of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest fixture setup for testing 'yaml' module availability and various 'munch' classes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
