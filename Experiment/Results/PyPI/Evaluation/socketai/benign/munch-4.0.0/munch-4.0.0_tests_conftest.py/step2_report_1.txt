  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward pytest fixture setup for testing 'yaml' and 'munch' modules.\n- No external or untrusted data is processed, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.\n- The code handles optional dependencies safely with try-except blocks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The fixtures are used solely for testing purposes, with no evidence of supply chain threats or malicious intent.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications.\n- The 'yaml' module is imported only when fixtures are invoked, and tests are skipped if unavailable—standard practice.\n- The 'munch_obj' fixture creates instances with fixed arguments, including a lambda, which is typical in test setup.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear and straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (e.g., 0.0 or 0.1). Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, these seem appropriate.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code only sets up testing fixtures without handling untrusted input or performing risky operations, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- No indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign test fixture setup with no security concerns.",
