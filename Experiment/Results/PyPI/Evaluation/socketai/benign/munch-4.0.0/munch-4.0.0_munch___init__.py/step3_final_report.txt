  "sources": "Reading input data during serialization/deserialization, attribute access via __getattr__, __setattr__, and __delattr__.",
  "sinks": "eval() in __repr__ potentially executing code if repr() output is manipulated or fed into eval() externally; deserialization functions processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "repr() output (source) is evaluated by eval() (sink); deserialization functions (fromJSON, fromYAML) process external data that could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() in __repr__, which is a known security concern; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a dict subclass with attribute-style access, conversion, and serialization support. The only notable security concern is the use of eval() in __repr__, which can be exploited if the string is manipulated or evaluated in an unsafe context. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. Serialization functions handle untrusted data but do not execute code. The overall structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily a utility library. The main security consideration is the eval() in __repr__, which should be documented or replaced with safer alternatives if security is critical. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall risk is low, with a slight concern due to eval().",
