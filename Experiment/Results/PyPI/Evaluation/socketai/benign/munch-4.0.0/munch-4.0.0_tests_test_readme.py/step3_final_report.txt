  "purpose": "To verify the existence of README.md and run doctests on it within a pytest environment.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.join, __file__, os.path.exists, doctest.testfile, pytest fixtures",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Construction of file path from __file__, assertion of file existence, execution of doctest on README.md",
  "anomalies": "Assertion at import time to check file existence; use of pytest fixtures without context; no malicious or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup for documentation testing: it resolves the README.md path relative to the script, asserts its existence, and runs doctests within pytest. No untrusted input, network activity, or data leaks are involved. The assertion at import time is slightly unconventional but not harmful. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script for documentation validation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
