  "conclusion": "The code is benign test code with no malicious intent or behavior. The use of yaml.FullLoader and static YAML strings ensures minimal security risk. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting awareness of YAML deserialization concerns but justified by the controlled environment."
