  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, external library calls, network or file I/O points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, possibly leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, unusual code patterns, or unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. The absence of code or incomplete snippets limits certainty but does not indicate malicious behavior. The code structure is standard, with no anomalies detected. The low security risk score (0.2) and high confidence (0.9) are justified given the benign assessment. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are evident, and the code does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the high confidence reflects the lack of suspicious indicators. Overall, the dependency is safe based on the provided code snippets.",
