  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources, depending on the implementation details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file writes, or database queries where untrusted data could be used unsafely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through processing functions to sinks like network or file I/O operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual language features or code patterns are absent. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated sections observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is structurally straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and practices. It does not exhibit signs of malware such as system data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The absence of suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code reduces concerns. Without explicit external calls or data leaks, it appears to perform its intended functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a benign utility or processing script. Confidence in this assessment is high, with no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
