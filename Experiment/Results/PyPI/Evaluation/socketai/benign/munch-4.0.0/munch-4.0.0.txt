The main security consideration is the eval() in __repr__, which should be documented or replaced with safer alternatives if security is critical. No malware or obfuscation detected. Overall risk is low, with a slight concern due to eval()."

The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting awareness of YAML deserialization concerns but justified by the controlled environment."
