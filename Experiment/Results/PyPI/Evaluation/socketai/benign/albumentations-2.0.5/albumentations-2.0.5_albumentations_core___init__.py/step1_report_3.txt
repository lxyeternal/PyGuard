  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose can be identified from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, files, or network sources, though no explicit input sources are evident in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, or data storage operations, but none are clearly present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; specific paths are not evident from the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are apparent. The code uses standard library functions without unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network connections. It uses typical Python constructs and third-party libraries that are common in open-source projects. No anomalies or unusual behaviors are identified. The code does not perform any insecure operations or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and standard in structure and content.",
