{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be for data processing or utility functions, likely within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and potentially external modules or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be sent to network connections, file writes, or executed via dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Data from input or environment variables flows into processing functions or modules, with some data potentially reaching output or external connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors detected; usage of dynamic execution or obfuscated code is absent. No unusual language features or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks without any indications of malicious intent. It does not contain suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The usage of dependencies is typical for open-source projects. No anomalies or obfuscated code patterns are identified. The code structure is straightforward, with clear data flow and no evident security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs routine functions consistent with open-source utility modules. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
