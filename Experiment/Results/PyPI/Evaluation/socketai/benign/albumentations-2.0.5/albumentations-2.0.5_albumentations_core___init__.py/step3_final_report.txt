  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network connections, hardcoded IPs/domains, eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscated variables, indirect data flows.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, code execution points, data exfiltration channels, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into eval()/exec() or network modules, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IPs/domains, use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network addresses, indirect data flows, incomplete code snippets, dynamic code execution indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1, 3, and 4, with high confidence and low risk scores. Report 2 shows strong indicators of malicious activity, including network connections to suspicious domains, eval() usage, obfuscation, and hardcoded addresses, justifying high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores. Report 5 presents signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with moderate suspicion; its malware score (0.2) is conservative. Considering the suspicion, a slight increase in malware score to 0.4 and security risk to 0.5 is justified to better reflect potential malicious behavior. Overall, the scores are consistent with the behaviors described, with Report 2 being the most critical concern.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the code's security posture. Report 2 indicates high malicious potential, while reports 1, 3, and 4 are benign. Report 5 warrants cautious monitoring; increasing its malware and risk scores slightly improves alignment with observed suspicious features. The overall assessment suggests a moderate to high risk primarily driven by Report 2, with some concern in Report 5.",
