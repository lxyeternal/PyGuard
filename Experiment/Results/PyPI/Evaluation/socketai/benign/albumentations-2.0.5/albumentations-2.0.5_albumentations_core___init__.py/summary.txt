  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the code's security posture. Report 2 indicates high malicious potential, while reports 1, 3, and 4 are benign. Report 5 warrants cautious monitoring; increasing its malware and risk scores slightly improves alignment with observed suspicious features. The overall assessment suggests a moderate to high risk primarily driven by Report 2, with some concern in Report 5."
