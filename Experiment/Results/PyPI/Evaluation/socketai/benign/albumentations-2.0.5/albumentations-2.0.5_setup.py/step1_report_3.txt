{
  "purpose": "The script defines dependencies for a Python package and dynamically adds an OpenCV package based on current installation status.",
  "sources": "Reading import statements, list of dependencies, functions is_installed() and choose_opencv_requirement(), and the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or actions. The code manipulates package requirements and calls setup(), which are standard procedures.",
  "flows": "The code checks for existing package installations, attempts to import cv2, and appends appropriate OpenCV requirements to INSTALL_REQUIRES, then calls setup() with these dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The logic for selecting OpenCV packages is straightforward and based on installed packages; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency management, checking for existing OpenCV installations and choosing the appropriate package to include. Functions are simple and standard. No malicious or suspicious activity, data leaks, or malware indicators. No obfuscation or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for dependency management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
