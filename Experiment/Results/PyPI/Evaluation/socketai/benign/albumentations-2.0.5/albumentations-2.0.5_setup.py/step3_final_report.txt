  "purpose": "Manage dependencies for a Python package, conditionally adding OpenCV packages based on existing installations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_distribution function, import cv2, environment checks, list of dependencies",
  "sinks": "Appending to INSTALL_REQUIRES list, setup() call with dependencies",
  "flows": "Check if cv2 is importable; if so, determine installed OpenCV package; if not, add headless OpenCV dependency",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward dependency management; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-aware dependency management using standard libraries and practices. It checks for existing OpenCV installations and appends the appropriate package requirement. No untrusted data, network calls, or malicious code are present. The logic is clear and conventional, with exception handling for package detection. The code is free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup dependency manager with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly detects existing OpenCV installations and adjusts dependencies accordingly. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are accurate, but the minimal security risk should be set to 0 for precision.",
