  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying a critical security perspective.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages dependencies, particularly OpenCV, based on existing installations. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is identified.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, standard for setup scripts. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **reasonable.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dependency management. Slight mention of a security risk score of 0.1, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The logic remains standard, with no external network or untrusted data flows. The minor security risk score (0.1) is probably due to the conditional dependency addition, but this is common and not inherently risky.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **reasonable.**\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward dependency setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activities or code obfuscation. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard dependency management, no malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The code performs environment checks and adjusts dependencies accordingly, typical for setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate.**\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency management logic, with a very low security risk score.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects the environment-aware dependency addition, which is common.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for dependency management. No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores are consistent with the code's behavior. The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is the conditional dependency addition, but this is a normal practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of **0** is appropriate. Slightly higher scores (like 0.1) are acceptable for environmental dependency management but do not indicate security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0**\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard dependency setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
