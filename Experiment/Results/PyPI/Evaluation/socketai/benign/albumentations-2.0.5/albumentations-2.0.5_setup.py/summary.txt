  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup dependency manager with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly detects existing OpenCV installations and adjusts dependencies accordingly. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are accurate, but the minimal security risk should be set to 0 for precision."
