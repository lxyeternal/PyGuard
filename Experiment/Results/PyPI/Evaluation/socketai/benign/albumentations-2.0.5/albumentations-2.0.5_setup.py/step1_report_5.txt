{
  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package with specific dependencies and optional OpenCV package selection based on existing installations.",
  "sources": "get_distribution function (to check installed packages), import cv2 (to detect existing OpenCV installation), and the code logic within choose_opencv_requirement function.",
  "sinks": "The installation process that uses the dependencies list, which could be manipulated if the list is altered externally, but no direct data sinks are involved in malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "The code flow checks for installed packages, conditionally appends OpenCV packages based on the environment, and ultimately passes dependencies to the setup function for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior are present. The code performs straightforward dependency management and environment checks without obfuscation or malicious side effects.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a list of required packages. It checks for existing OpenCV installations by attempting to import cv2 and querying installed packages. Based on these checks, it conditionally appends the appropriate OpenCV package requirement. The setup function is then called with the final list of packages. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code's logic is standard for setup scripts, and no obfuscation or malware-like behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with environment-aware dependency management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security assessment is very low risk.",
