  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, the scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The script manages dependencies for a Python package.\n- It checks if OpenCV (`cv2`) is installed.\n- If installed, it determines which OpenCV package is present and uses that.\n- If not installed, it defaults to adding `opencv-python-headless` with a specified minimum version.\n- The process involves standard package management practices, exception handling, and environment checks.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, straightforward dependency management, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.9). The mention of a \"securityRisk\" of 0.1 is perhaps overly cautious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any network operations or execute untrusted code. The only potential concern is the environment-dependent dependency addition, which is standard. The small security risk score is acceptable but could be zero.\n- **Recommendation:** Consider lowering `securityRisk` to 0, as there's no real risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, very standard dependency management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, with a slight security risk score of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The environment-dependent dependency addition is standard.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations & Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), but based on the code, there's no real security risk. I recommend setting it to 0 across all reports.\n- **Potential False Positives:** The logic for dependency management based on environment is common and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk:** 0 (no real security concerns; environment checks are standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are mostly accurate, but the security risk scores should be lowered to 0 for correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The dependency management logic is conventional, and the environment checks are routine. The minimal security risk scores assigned in some reports are slightly overstated; they should be zero.",
