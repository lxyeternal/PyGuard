  "purpose": "Define and manage installation requirements for a Python package, including conditional handling of OpenCV dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements from INSTALL_REQUIRES list, attempting to import cv2, checking installed distributions with get_distribution.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, perform network operations, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "If OpenCV is not installed, the code adds a headless OpenCV requirement; otherwise, it uses the installed version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward dependency management logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package dependency management with conditional logic based on installed packages. It uses functions to detect installed packages and choose the appropriate OpenCV package. No external data is read from untrusted sources, nor does it perform any suspicious actions like network access or file modifications. The code is standard for setup scripts, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The try-except block for import cv2 is normal, and the version handling appears standard. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup configuration script that manages dependencies. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
