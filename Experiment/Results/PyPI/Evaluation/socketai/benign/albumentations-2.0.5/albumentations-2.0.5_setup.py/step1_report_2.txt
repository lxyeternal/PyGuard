{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including dependency management and conditional OpenCV package selection.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'INSTALL_REQUIRES' list, the 'OPENCV_PACKAGES' list, and attempts to import 'cv2'. It also uses functions 'get_distribution' and 'import' statements.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be the 'setup()' function which installs dependencies based on the determined requirements. No untrusted input is directly fed into critical security-sensitive sinks such as system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code checks for existing installed packages (sources) and based on the presence of 'cv2', it conditionally appends a dependency (sink) to 'INSTALL_REQUIRES'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The logic appears standard for dependency management. There are no suspicious data leaks, external network operations, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script manages dependencies for a Python package, dynamically adding OpenCV requirements based on existing installations. It uses 're' for parsing package names, 'get_distribution' for installed package detection, and conditional logic to determine which OpenCV package to include. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or suspicious activities. All operations are standard for a setup script. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. It operates within the expected scope of package dependency setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for managing dependencies with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It conditionally manages OpenCV requirements based on existing installations without exposing sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
