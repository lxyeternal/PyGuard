{
  "purpose": "Define a set of base classes and utility methods for applying transformations to images, masks, bounding boxes, keypoints, volumes, and 3D data in a structured and extensible manner, primarily for data augmentation.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes, method parameters, imported modules, and random seed initialization for generating randomness.",
  "sinks": "Application of transformations to image, mask, or volumetric data; no external data sinks or network calls detected.",
  "flows": "Random seed and generator setup influence probabilistic decision-making; transformation methods process data in a controlled manner. No flow of untrusted data to external systems or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or backdoors detected. Use of random generators is standard for data augmentation. No obfuscated or unusual language features. No dynamic code execution, such as eval or exec, observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a framework for applying image and volume transformations, with clear separation of concerns and standard practices for randomness and data handling. The random seed setup enhances reproducibility. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The import statements, class structures, and method implementations are consistent with data processing tasks. No network calls, file operations, or hidden behaviors identified. The use of third-party libraries appears legitimate and focused on image processing and data augmentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured data transformation framework with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It handles data transformations typical for machine learning pipelines, without malicious intent or security risks.",
