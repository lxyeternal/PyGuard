  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data augmentation framework with no malicious or suspicious features. The malware score should be 0, obfuscation score 0, and the overall security risk very low (~0.1) primarily due to the questionable import which should be verified but does not suggest malicious intent."
