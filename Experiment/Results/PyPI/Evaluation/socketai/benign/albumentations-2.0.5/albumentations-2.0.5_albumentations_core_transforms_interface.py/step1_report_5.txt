{
  "purpose": "Define base classes and utility structures for image and volume transformations, including handling of associated annotations like masks, keypoints, and bounding boxes.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (cv2, numpy, albucore, pydantic, albumentations) and class/method definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as apply, apply_to_mask, apply_to_keypoints, apply_to_bboxes, which process image and annotation data.",
  "flows": "Input data (images, masks, keypoints, bboxes, volumes) are passed to transformation methods which may modify and return the data, with parameters potentially influencing behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code primarily defines class structures and straightforward data processing methods.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a flexible, extensible framework for applying various transformations to images, masks, keypoints, bounding boxes, and 3D volumes. It employs standard patterns, such as properties, class inheritance, and method overriding, to manage different data modalities and ensure consistency. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoor logic. Usage of numpy random generators and seed setting appears safe and standard. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, eval, or exec calls. Import statements and method implementations are typical for such a library, with no suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate framework for image and volume transformations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured for its purpose and does not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
