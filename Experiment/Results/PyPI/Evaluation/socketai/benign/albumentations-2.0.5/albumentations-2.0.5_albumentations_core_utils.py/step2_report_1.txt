  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for shape extraction, data validation, label handling, and range calculations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows within the code, no external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard data processing, shape extraction, label encoding, and range functions. Uses common libraries (numpy, torch, albumentations). No malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured utility code with minimal security risk (0.1). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in scope—utility functions for shape extraction, data validation, label processing, and range calculations.\n- No external system calls or suspicious patterns.\n- Uses standard libraries and external label manager.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk: 0.1. Malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focused on data processing, shape extraction, label handling.\n- No network, file, or system-level operations.\n- Uses typical ML data handling patterns.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk: 0.2. Malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Utility functions for shape extraction, validation, label processing.\n- No external system interactions.\n- Uses standard libraries.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- Security risk: 0.2. Malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar purpose—data validation, shape extraction, label management.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Uses common libraries.\n- Security risk: 0.1. Malware score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports describe code that is purely utility functions for shape extraction, data validation, label encoding, and range calculations. These are standard in image/volume data pipelines.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports indicate obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious external interactions. The code does not perform network calls, file manipulations, or system modifications.\n- **Security Risks:** The overall security risk remains minimal (around 0.1–0.2), consistent with standard utility code.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (standard utility functions, very low security concern)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for image and volume data processing, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reported scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and legitimacy within supply chain security considerations.",
