  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for shape extraction, data validation, label handling, and range calculations in image and volume data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from dictionaries ('volume', 'image', 'images'), and shape extraction functions accessing numpy arrays or torch tensors.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations within functions; no external system calls or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Source functions feed into shape extraction and validation; label processing functions encode/decode labels; range functions process scalar or sequence inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or external system interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for shape extraction, data validation, label encoding, and range processing. It uses common libraries (numpy, torch, albumentations). No malicious behavior, network activity, or system modifications are present. The functions are typical for ML data pipelines, with clear structure and purpose. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for image and volume data processing. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, risk approximately 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
