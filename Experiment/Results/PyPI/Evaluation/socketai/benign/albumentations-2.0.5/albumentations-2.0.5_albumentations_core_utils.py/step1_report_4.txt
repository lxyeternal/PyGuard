{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and abstract classes for data processing, shape extraction, and parameter handling in image and volume data pipelines, likely for machine learning or image augmentation workflows.",
  "sources": "Input data for functions like get_image_shape, get_volume_shape, get_shape; parameters for validation and conversion functions; data fields in class methods.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions and data processing methods that manipulate numpy arrays, sequences, or dictionaries; label manager processing; data transformation methods.",
  "flows": "Data is sourced from input arguments (images, volumes, data dictionaries), processed through shape extraction, validation, label encoding, and conversion functions, then possibly restructured or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. Use of standard libraries and functions, with no network access or system manipulation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs shape extraction, validation, and conversion of image/volume data, and manages labels via an external label manager. It includes utility functions for parameter normalization and type handling. No code patterns indicating malware or malicious intent were found. All data processing appears to be standard for machine learning or augmentation workflows, with no network, file system, or privilege escalation activities. The functions are well-structured and use common libraries without obfuscation or hidden code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for data processing in image/volume pipelines with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be safe and legitimate, focusing on data validation, shape handling, and label management without any suspicious network or system activities.",
