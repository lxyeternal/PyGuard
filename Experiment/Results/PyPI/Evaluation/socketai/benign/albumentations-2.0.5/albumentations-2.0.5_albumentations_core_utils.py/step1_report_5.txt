{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions, abstract classes, and data processing methods for image and volume shape extraction, data validation, label processing, and range calculations within a larger data augmentation or processing framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., 'img', 'vol', 'data', 'args_dict', 'param', 'low', 'bias'), class constructors, and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations and conversions within class methods (e.g., 'check_and_convert', 'convert_to_albumentations', 'convert_from_albumentations') which process data, but no direct untrusted external data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (images, volumes, parameters) flow through shape extraction, validation, and conversion functions; label fields are processed and embedded within data dictionaries; range calculations may incorporate biases or limits, but no external or system commands are executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard Python idioms, and external library usage (numpy, torch, albumentations) is typical for image processing tasks. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and abstract classes for data processing related to images, volumes, and labels. It handles shape extraction, data validation, label embedding, and range calculations. No network operations, file I/O, or system commands are present. The functions perform data transformations and validation with standard libraries, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. All external library calls are for legitimate purposes in data processing. The 'get_shape' functions safely handle different tensor formats. The 'to_tuple' function provides flexible range calculations with input validation. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured data processing module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data processing and utility module used in image/volume augmentation workflows. It contains no malicious or sabotage code, no external system calls, and no suspicious data handling. Its design is consistent with safe processing of data for image augmentation or similar tasks.",
