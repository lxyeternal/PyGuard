{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and abstract base classes for data processing, shape extraction, and parameter handling, primarily for image and volume data in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as get_image_shape, get_volume_shape, get_shape; class methods processing data dictionaries; parameters passed into functions like to_tuple and process_sequence.",
  "sinks": "Data manipulation and conversion functions, especially _process_label_fields, _remove_label_fields, and check_and_convert, where data arrays are processed, encoded, and potentially modified.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input variables (e.g., data dictionaries, np.ndarray, torch.Tensor). Label fields are processed and possibly encoded via label_manager. Data is then converted or validated, and label fields may be removed or replaced.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of label_manager and data processing appears standard. No network operations or file manipulations indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and class definitions for handling image/volume shapes, data validation, and label processing. No network operations, no file access, or code execution that could be malicious. The label_manager is used for encoding/decoding label fields, which is typical in ML workflows. Functions like get_image_shape and get_volume_shape simply return shape info. The process functions and to_tuple handle parameter normalization with appropriate error checking. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured for data preprocessing with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed for data processing and shape extraction in ML pipelines, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard data validation, shape handling, and label processing without suspicious or harmful operations.",
