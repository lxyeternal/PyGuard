  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for handling, converting, filtering, and validating bounding boxes in object detection tasks, supporting multiple formats and image transformations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input bounding box arrays, image shape parameters, and optional additional label fields. Data is also read from masks in functions like bboxes_from_masks and masks_from_bboxes.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flow occurs if external input is used directly in functions like convert_bboxes_to_albumentations, convert_bboxes_from_albumentations, or filter_bboxes without validation. Functions like clip_bboxes, check_bboxes, and mask_to_bboxes modify input data, but only based on the input data and shape parameters, not external untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into conversion and validation functions (e.g., convert_bboxes_to_albumentations, check_bboxes). Validated or transformed data is then used in filtering (filter_bboxes) or returned as output. Functions like mask_to_bboxes create new data based on masks, and union_of_bboxes generates a union box possibly after erosion, which can affect system behavior if input is maliciously crafted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections are present. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. Use of np.where, np.clip, and array operations are standard numerical procedures. All functions perform legitimate image processing tasks; no hidden or malicious code paths are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly handles bounding box transformations, validation, and masking, with attention to format conversions and boundary conditions. Functions like check_bboxes and filter_bboxes include checks to prevent invalid data, and shape parameters are used to ensure proper scaling. No malicious data leakage, network activity, or harmful file operations are present. The code relies on standard numpy operations and includes validation steps, indicating good security practices. Although complex, all logic is consistent with typical bounding box processing. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors. Overall, the implementation appears to be a legitimate utility module for object detection pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides comprehensive, legitimate bounding box utilities with proper validation and format conversion. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The functions operate within expected parameters, and no suspicious or harmful behavior is evident. The overall security risk is minimal.",
