{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for handling, validating, converting, normalizing, denormalizing, and filtering bounding boxes and masks in computer vision tasks, supporting multiple bounding box formats and operations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from numpy arrays representing bounding boxes, shape dictionaries or tuples for image dimensions, and binary masks for mask operations.",
  "sinks": "Data flows through format conversion functions, validation routines, filtering, clipping, and mask generation; no external network or file I/O is involved.",
  "flows": "Input bounding boxes are converted between formats, validated, clipped to image boundaries, filtered based on size and aspect ratio, and possibly converted back; masks are generated from boxes and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code is standard for bounding box and mask processing in CV pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bounding box operations including format conversions (COCO, Pascal VOC, YOLO, Albumentations), validation of coordinate ranges and box validity, normalization/denormalization relative to image size, clipping to image boundaries, filtering based on size and aspect ratio, and mask creation from boxes and vice versa. All functions follow typical geometric and array operations with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Validation routines help prevent invalid data from propagating, and the code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for bounding box and mask processing with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The overall security risk is very low (~0.1), mainly due to potential issues if untrusted data is not validated, but current validation routines mitigate this risk effectively.",
