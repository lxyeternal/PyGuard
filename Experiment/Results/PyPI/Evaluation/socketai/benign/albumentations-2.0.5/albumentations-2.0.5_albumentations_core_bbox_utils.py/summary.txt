  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for bounding box and mask processing with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The overall security risk is very low (~0.1), mainly due to potential issues if untrusted data is not validated, but current validation routines mitigate this risk effectively."
