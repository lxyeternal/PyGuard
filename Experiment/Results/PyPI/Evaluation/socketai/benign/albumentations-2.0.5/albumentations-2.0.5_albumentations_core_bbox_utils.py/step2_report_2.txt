  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described functionality with the code, and assess the potential security implications, malware risk, obfuscation, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard for bounding box handling, with no malicious patterns or obfuscation. It performs format conversions, validation, filtering, normalization, and mask operations, all typical in CV pipelines.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The confidence score (0.9) aligns with the thorough review.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (very low). This is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the legitimacy of the functions, with no signs of malicious activity. The code is a comprehensive utility for bounding box processing.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The confidence (0.95) is appropriate.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 (still very low). This is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is standard for bounding box and mask processing, with validation, conversion, filtering, and no network or system calls. The functions are well-structured and legitimate.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The confidence (0.95) is justified.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0. This aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive utility module for bounding box and mask operations, with thorough validation and conversion routines. No malicious intent or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is transparent, standard, and well-documented. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles bounding boxes and masks, with validation and conversion, all typical for CV pipelines. No external or malicious activity is indicated.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The confidence (0.95) and risk (0.1) are reasonable.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's nature as a utility library for CV tasks.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, and the code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Very low across all reports, ranging from 0.0 to 0.2, which is appropriate given the functions' benign purpose.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is transparent and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into functions, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for bounding box and mask processing in computer vision pipelines, with no malicious or obfuscating elements.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
