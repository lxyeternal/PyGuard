{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to fetch the latest version information of the 'albumentations' package from PyPI, parse the version, compare it with the current version, and warn the user if an update is available.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'https://pypi.org/pypi/albumentations/json' via an HTTP GET request, and retrieves response content and headers.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the warning function that notifies the user about available updates. No data is written to untrusted locations or sent over the network beyond the initial fetch.",
  "flows": "Source: fetch_version_info() retrieves JSON data from PyPI; parsed in parse_version(); compared in check_for_updates() to current_version. If a newer version exists, triggers a warning.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The network request is straightforward, and warnings are only informational. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a benign network request to PyPI to check for package updates, which is a common practice. It uses standard libraries and straightforward parsing and comparison methods. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The only external activity is fetching JSON data and issuing warnings based on version comparison. All network communication appears legitimate and purpose-driven. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard update-checking utility for a Python package. It performs network requests to a trusted source (PyPI), parses JSON data, and warns about updates. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code.",
