{
  "purpose": "The code fetches the latest version information of the 'albumentations' package from PyPI, parses the JSON response to extract the version string, compares it with the current installed version, and issues a warning if an update is available.",
  "sources": "Network request to 'https://pypi.org/pypi/albumentations/json' via urllib.request, reading the JSON response data.",
  "sinks": "Warning issued via the warn() function if a newer version is detected, informing the user about available updates.",
  "flows": "Source: Network fetch of JSON data -> parse_version() extracts 'version' -> compare_versions() compares latest and current versions -> warn() triggers if update available.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a benign network request to a trusted source (PyPI), parses JSON data safely with exception handling, and compares semantic versions with custom logic. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The network activity is limited to a single HTTPS GET request, and the warning mechanism is standard. The version comparison correctly handles pre-releases and release versions. Overall, the code is a typical update notifier with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for checking package updates. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores in the reports—malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1)—are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
