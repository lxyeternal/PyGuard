  "purpose": "The code checks for new versions of the 'albumentations' library by fetching version info from PyPI and notifies the user if an update is available.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the URL 'https://pypi.org/pypi/albumentations/json' using urllib.request.open().",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak or manipulation could occur at the network request to fetch version info, and the data is processed and parsed within the code.",
  "flows": "Source: URL fetch (network request) -> Response data -> JSON parsing -> Version comparison -> User warning if update available.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The network request is straightforward. Version comparison logic appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs version checking by fetching JSON data from PyPI, parsing it, and comparing it with the current version of the library. It uses safe practices for network requests with timeouts and error handling. No user input or untrusted data is directly incorporated. The code does not include any malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All external communications are benign, limited to fetching version info from a trusted source. The comparison functions and parsing logic are standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version-checking utility that fetches and compares version data from PyPI. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behavior. It is safe and straightforward.",
