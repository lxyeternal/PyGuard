  "purpose": "Serialization and deserialization framework for transformation classes in the albumentations library, supporting JSON and YAML formats, with class registry management and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, import statements, dynamic import of optional modules, file and buffer I/O operations, class registry manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization functions reconstruct class instances from data; no untrusted data execution or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Data read from files/buffers -> parsed into dicts -> class registry lookup -> class instantiation -> object reconstruction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of dynamic imports is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard serialization system with class registries, optional dependency handling, and safe file I/O. No malicious patterns, code injection, or network activity are present. The use of class registries and metaclasses is typical for such frameworks. Error handling and dependency checks are appropriate. The optional import of 'torch' is a common pattern and does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The code's behavior aligns with safe serialization/deserialization practices, and no vulnerabilities are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard serialization utility with no signs of malicious or sabotage activity. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
