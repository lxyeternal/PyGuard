{
  "purpose": "The code provides serialization and deserialization utilities for transformation pipelines, particularly for the albumentations library, including support for JSON and YAML formats.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from files or file-like objects during load() functions; class names and module info are retrieved via class attributes and introspection.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files or file-like objects during save() functions; serialized data is outputted in JSON or YAML formats.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from load() into parsing functions; serialized objects are processed through to_dict() and serialize_enum(), then written to files; during from_dict(), data flows into class constructors based on registry lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets are present. The code relies on standard library modules and well-known third-party modules (like json, yaml, importlib). No obfuscated code or dynamic execution techniques are used.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard serialization/deserialization patterns for Python objects, with registry-based class handling, enum value conversion, and optional YAML support. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors is observed. The registry management and class instantiation are straightforward and controlled. Import of optional dependencies like torch is conditional and safe. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard serialization utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured serialization/deserialization utility for the albumentations library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no indications of supply chain attacks. It operates solely on known data and modules, with safe patterns for class registration, file I/O, and data handling.",
