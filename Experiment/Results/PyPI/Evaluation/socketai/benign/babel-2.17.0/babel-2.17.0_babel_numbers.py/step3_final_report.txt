{
  "purpose": "Locale-dependent formatting and parsing of numeric data, including currencies, percentages, scientific notation, and pattern-based number formatting, relying on locale data and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Locale data dictionaries, environment variables, input strings, pattern strings, regex matching, and decimal operations.",
  "sinks": "Formatted strings returned to callers; no network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (numbers, strings, locale identifiers) processed through pattern parsing, locale data access, and string formatting functions to produce locale-aware numeric outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Pattern parsing and locale data access are standard; no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured locale-aware number and currency formatting library. It uses pattern parsing, regex, and locale data to format and parse numbers. No network activity, code injection, or external data fetching occurs. Warnings about deprecated functions are benign. The supply chain concern is external—locale data could be maliciously replaced outside the code, but this is not embedded malicious code. The functions operate solely on trusted data and standard modules, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex internationalization utility with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The primary external concern is the integrity of locale data, not the code itself.",
