  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain active malicious behavior. However, it relies on untrusted pickle files, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if files are compromised. The primary security concern is the deserialization process. The malware score should be set to 0, as no active malware is present. The risk score should be elevated to reflect the potential for malicious code execution, approximately around 0.75-0.8. Obfuscation is not present. Overall, the code presents a moderate to high security risk due to unsafe deserialization, but no active malicious intent is evident."
