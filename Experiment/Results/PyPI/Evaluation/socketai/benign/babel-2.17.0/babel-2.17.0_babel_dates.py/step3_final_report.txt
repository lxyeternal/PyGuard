  "purpose": "Locale-aware formatting and parsing of dates and times, supporting multiple formats, locales, and timezone handling.",
  "sources": "Locale data access, pattern parsing, timezone conversions, input date/time values, environment variables for locale.",
  "sinks": "Formatted string outputs, pattern applications, timezone name retrieval, locale data retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates, times, pattern strings) flow through pattern parsing, locale data access, timezone localization, and formatting functions to produce output strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Pattern parsing and skeleton matching are standard; no obfuscation or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard locale-aware date/time formatting and parsing functions, relying on well-known libraries (babel, datetime, zoneinfo/pytz). It performs pattern tokenization, skeleton matching, timezone conversions, and locale data access in a predictable manner. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Pattern handling is inherent to formatting libraries and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and data flows are transparent and consistent with internationalization utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured locale-aware date/time utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The pattern processing and locale data access are standard, and no external or hidden malicious activities are evident.",
