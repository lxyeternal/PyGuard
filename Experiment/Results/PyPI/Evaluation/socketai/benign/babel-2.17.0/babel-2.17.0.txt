The primary security concern is the execution of an external script without validation, which is appropriately reflected in the low risk score. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but contains a significant security vulnerability due to the unsafe use of `eval()` for executing rule expressions. This poses a high risk if rule inputs are untrusted, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. Proper validation, sanitization, or alternative evaluation methods are recommended to mitigate this risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain active malicious behavior. However, it relies on untrusted pickle files, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if files are compromised. The primary security concern is the deserialization process. The malware score should be set to 0, as no active malware is present. The risk score should be elevated to reflect the potential for malicious code execution, approximately around 0.75-0.8. Obfuscation is not present. Overall, the code presents a moderate to high security risk due to unsafe deserialization, but no active malicious intent is evident."
