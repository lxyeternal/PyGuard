  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward, retrieving language data from Babel's `territory_languages` global, filtering by official status, sorting by population percentage, and returning language codes. No suspicious activity, external network, or data leaks observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no evident security issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with the same conclusions. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no issues. No malicious activity, no network or file operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still very low, possibly considering the reliance on external data, but this is standard.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, similar analysis. Input normalization, data access via `get_global`, filtering, sorting, safe data handling. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with standard data access and filtering. No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports; functions are read-only, data is fetched from Babel's global data, no network or file operations, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears to be a standard utility for accessing Babel's CLDR data, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low or zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not perform any network, file, or system modifications.\n- It only reads data from a trusted third-party library (Babel) via `get_global`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions are purely data retrieval and filtering, with no malicious logic.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, safe, and free from security issues. The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
