{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve official language information for territories using the Babel library and CLDR data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters `territory`, `regional`, and `de_facto` in `get_official_languages`; `territory` in `get_territory_language_info`. Data retrieval from `get_global('territory_languages')`.",
  "sinks": "Return of tuples and dictionaries based on input data; no data sinks such as network, file, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> data retrieval from Babel's global data -> processing and filtering -> output of language info or list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code relies on external Babel functions and data.",
  "analysis": "The code functions primarily as a data accessor and filter, utilizing Babel's `get_global` to fetch language data. The functions perform input normalization, filtering based on language status, sorting by population, and returning structured data. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or insecure handling of sensitive data is present. The code is well-structured, using standard library and third-party API calls, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and safe data-processing module for language information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly accesses and processes data from Babel's CLDR datasets without unsafe operations.",
