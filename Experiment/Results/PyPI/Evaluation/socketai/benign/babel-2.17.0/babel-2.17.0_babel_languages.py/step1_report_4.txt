{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to retrieve official language information for a specified territory, including regional and de facto statuses, using the Babel library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (`territory`, `regional`, `de_facto`) and accesses external global data via `get_global('territory_languages')`.",
  "sinks": "The data retrieved from `get_global` is processed internally; no sinks such as network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are sanitized (converted to strings and uppercased), then data is fetched from a global source, filtered, sorted, and returned. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code performs straightforward data filtering and sorting. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard parameter validation, accesses a global data store via `get_global`, and processes data in a typical manner. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected. The functions are read-only and perform no network, file, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for language information retrieval based on the Babel library. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The primary concern is its reliance on external global data which should be verified for integrity, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident.",
