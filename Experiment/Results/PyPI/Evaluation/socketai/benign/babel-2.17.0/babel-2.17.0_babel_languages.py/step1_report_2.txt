{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve official language information for a given territory using the Babel library, mainly for language and territory data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'territory', 'regional', and 'de_facto'. Data retrieval from 'get_global' function for 'territory_languages'.",
  "sinks": "Data returned as tuples and dictionaries; no evident sink where untrusted data affects sensitive operations. No system or network calls within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the filtering of language data fetched from 'get_global'. The data flows from 'get_global' to local variables and is returned without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Usage of standard library and third-party functions appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code uses Babel's 'get_global' to access 'territory_languages' data, then filters and sorts language info based on input flags. No untrusted data manipulation, code injection, or obfuscated segments are present. The code relies on external data source 'get_global' for critical data, which is a normal pattern. No network, file, or environment variable handling is observed. The logic appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data retrieval and filtering implementation using Babel's language data. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No malware indicators are present, and the overall security posture appears safe.",
