  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no external network or file operations, uses Babel's `get_global` safely. The code is straightforward, filtering and sorting language data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. The reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity or suspicious patterns. Uses Babel's data source safely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) possibly due to reliance on external data, but the code itself remains safe. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—safe data access, no malicious code, no external operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard data access and filtering, no external network/file operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—safe, straightforward data retrieval from Babel.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is purely data access and filtering.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low overall; some reports assign a tiny securityRisk (0.2) due to external data reliance, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file writes, or execute untrusted code.\n- It relies on Babel's `get_global`, which is a standard, trusted library function.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The minimal securityRisk score reflects reliance on external data, not malicious activity.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for external data dependency, but not a security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free from supply chain security issues or malicious behavior.",
