  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility for retrieving language data from Babel's `territory_languages` global data.\n- They confirm that the code only reads data, filters, sorts, and returns it; no network, file, or system modifications are performed.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The data source `get_global` is a standard Babel function, and its usage appears safe.\n- Confidence levels are high, and malware scores are zero across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or insecure practices.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning in all reports is sound. The code is simple, well-structured, and uses standard practices.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  Also 0 or very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Potential Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the data from `get_global('territory_languages')` is trustworthy and accurate. While this is generally safe for Babel, reliance on external datasets always carries some risk, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n### Any Unreasonable Score Adjustments?\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are reasonable and consistent with the code’s behavior.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code relies on external data (`get_global`) which could, in theory, be manipulated if Babel's internal data were compromised. However, this is an external dependency concern, not a code issue.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n## Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0** (or very close to zero)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a safe, read-only utility that interfaces with Babel's trusted data sources. There are no signs of malicious activity, no data leaks, no external network calls, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\nThe code is benign and secure. The high confidence and zero malware score are justified. No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions based on the provided reports.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at 0.  \n- Keep security risk score at 0.  \n- Confirm the code is safe for use and does not pose supply chain security risks.",
