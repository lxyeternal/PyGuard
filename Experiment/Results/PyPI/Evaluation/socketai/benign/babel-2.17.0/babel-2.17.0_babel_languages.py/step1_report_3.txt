{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve official languages and language information for a given territory using the Babel library's global data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the Babel's get_global('territory_languages') function, which accesses external dataset for territory-language mappings.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted input is directly written or transmitted; data retrieved is from a trusted library.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'territory' is transformed to uppercase and used as a key to fetch data. No untrusted data is written elsewhere or transmitted outside the scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are detected. The code relies on external library data which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code safely processes input parameters, transforming 'territory' to uppercase before using it as a key. It queries Babel's global data for territory language info, filters based on official status, sorts, and returns tuples. No untrusted data is handled insecurely. The functions are read-only and do not perform network operations or system modifications. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for accessing language data from the Babel library. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It relies on external trusted data sources and performs safe data processing.",
