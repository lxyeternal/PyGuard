  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve and filter language data for a given territory from Babel's global dataset.",
  "sources": "Accesses Babel's 'territory_languages' global data via get_global() and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; only reads data and returns filtered results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (territory, regional, de_facto) influence filtering; data is retrieved and sorted; no external data or system modifications occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, safe, and relies on trusted Babel data. It performs filtering and sorting without external network, file, or environment modifications. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code handles input normalization and data access securely. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, secure, and functions as a safe utility for language data retrieval. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
