{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve official languages and language information for a specified territory using the Babel library.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (`territory`, `regional`, `de_facto`) and global data via `get_global('territory_languages')`.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from `get_global`, processes it, and returns tuples or dictionaries; no untrusted data is written or sent over network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to filter and sort data retrieved from the global `territory_languages` source; no external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Use of `get_global` is standard for Babel; no direct network or file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature and a Babel function, then defines two functions: one to retrieve ordered language codes based on official status and popularity, and another to get detailed language info. Both functions sanitize the `territory` input by converting it to uppercase and query Babel's global data for territory-language mappings. They filter data based on parameters and sort the results. There are no external inputs beyond function parameters and no data manipulation that could lead to malicious activity. The code uses safe data handling practices without insecure code injection, external network calls, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for accessing Babel's territory language data, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain security issues. It does not perform any network operations, file writes, or execute untrusted code. The use of Babel's global data is standard and safe. Overall, it is a benign, well-structured module for language data retrieval.",
