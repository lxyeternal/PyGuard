  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration with a custom command executing an external script. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the execution of an external script without validation, which is appropriately reflected in the low risk score. The malware score remains at 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code."
