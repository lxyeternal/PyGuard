  "purpose": "Provides setup and shortcut methods for Google Cloud Storage API integration, including documentation and class imports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from trusted Google Cloud SDK modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data sources; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static module setup without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, with license headers and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a boilerplate module for Google Cloud Storage SDK initialization, containing license info, descriptive docstrings, static imports, and an __all__ declaration. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All imported modules are from official sources, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate API setup, with no potential for malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup module for Google Cloud Storage SDK, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
