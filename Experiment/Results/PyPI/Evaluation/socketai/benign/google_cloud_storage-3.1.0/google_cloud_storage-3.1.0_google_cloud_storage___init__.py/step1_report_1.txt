  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no execution flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup for Google Cloud Storage SDK, including import statements, license headers, and API documentation comments. It does not perform any data processing, external data input, or network communication. All imports are static, and there are no dynamic code evaluations or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, boilerplate setup for the Google Cloud Storage client library. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
