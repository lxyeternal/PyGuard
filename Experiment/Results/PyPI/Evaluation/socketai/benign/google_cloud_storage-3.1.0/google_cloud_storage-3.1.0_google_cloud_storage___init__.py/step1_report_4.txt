  "purpose": "Provide shortcut methods and documentation for setting up Google Cloud Storage API usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.storage and related modules; license comments; documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication; no network or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; license comments and standard module imports are typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license headers, docstrings, import statements, and an __all__ declaration. It imports specific classes and variables from the google.cloud.storage package, and provides documentation for API usage. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communications. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup and documentation module for Google Cloud Storage API with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and normal for its purpose.",
