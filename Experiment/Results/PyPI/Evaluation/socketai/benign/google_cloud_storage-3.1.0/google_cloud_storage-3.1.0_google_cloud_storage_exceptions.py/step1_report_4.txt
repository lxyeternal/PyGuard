{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to HTTP response errors and data corruption, with compatibility considerations for different library versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.resumable_media, constructor parameters response and args in exception classes",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and logging, potential data exposure if response objects contain sensitive information",
  "flows": "Response object passed to exception constructors, stored in exception instance for later inspection",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import fallback to generic Exception; no apparent hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on defining exception classes with compatibility logic for different library versions. It uses conditional import handling and standard inheritance patterns. The response object is stored in the exception class, which is typical for debugging or handling errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious data leaks. The code appears to be well-structured for its purpose and does not perform any external or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with compatibility handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
