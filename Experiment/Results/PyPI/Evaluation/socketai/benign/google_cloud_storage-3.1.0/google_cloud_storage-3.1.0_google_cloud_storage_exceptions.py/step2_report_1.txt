  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines custom exception classes (`InvalidResponse` and `DataCorruption`) that extend from base classes imported from `google.resumable_media`, with fallback to `Exception` if the import fails.\n   - The constructors accept a `response` object and optional arguments, store the response as an attribute, and pass arguments to the superclass.\n   - The use of conditional import and inheritance is a common pattern for maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.\n   - The response object is stored for debugging or error handling, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and intended for error handling.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n   - The use of try-except import for backward compatibility is typical and not malicious.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.5 or below, justified by the code's harmless purpose and lack of security issues.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The only minor consideration is that storing the response object could expose sensitive information if the exception is logged or exposed elsewhere. However, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are justified based on this code alone.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling pattern with backward compatibility support.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated scores, with a low security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (since it's very low but acknowledging that exceptions can sometimes expose internal data if misused)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe, benign, and typical for its purpose in a library.",
