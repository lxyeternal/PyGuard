  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, correctness, and security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code defines exception classes `InvalidResponse` and `DataCorruption`, with conditional inheritance based on optional imports. The response object is stored as an attribute. No suspicious behavior, data flow, or external activity detected.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code appears correct; the use of conditional inheritance for backward compatibility is standard practice.\n- **Scores review:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior; the code is typical exception handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues, safe, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes with backward compatibility. No external data flow or suspicious logic.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The implementation is straightforward and correct.\n- **Scores review:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard exception class definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—exception classes with conditional inheritance, storing response objects.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors; code is standard.\n- **Scores review:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No security issues or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical for error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, defining exceptions with backward compatibility, no external or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores review:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—exception classes, fallback inheritance, storing response object.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or security issues.\n- **Scores review:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard exception handling code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports describe standard, correct exception class definitions with backward compatibility handling.\n- **Malware:** No indication of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** No security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with benign code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since no security issues are present.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exceptions with backward compatibility support, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
