  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Review and Logical Confirmation:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes (`InvalidResponse` and `DataCorruption`) that inherit from dynamically imported parent classes, with fallback to `Exception` if the import fails.\n- The constructors accept a `response` object and optional `*args`, store the response in an attribute, and pass arguments to the superclass.\n- The use of try-except import statements ensures backward compatibility, which is a common pattern.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious data handling is present.\n- The response object is stored as an attribute, which is standard for exception classes, enabling debugging.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exceptions with backward compatibility support. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n**2. Review of the Reports:**\n\nAll five reports uniformly describe the code as:\n\n- Standard exception class definitions.\n- Using conditional inheritance for backward compatibility.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- No external data flows, injections, or suspicious patterns.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\nThe confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**3. Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**4. Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n\n- The only point to consider is the storage of the `response` object. If `response` contains sensitive information, storing it in exceptions could pose a security concern. However, this is a common pattern for debugging and error handling, and there's no indication that the code mishandles sensitive data.\n- The code's logic is straightforward and does not involve any suspicious or malicious operations.\n\n---\n\n**5. Final Assessment and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign implementation of custom exceptions with backward compatibility considerations. No anomalies, malicious activity, or security risks are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, the code is safe, standard, and intended for error handling in a library. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
