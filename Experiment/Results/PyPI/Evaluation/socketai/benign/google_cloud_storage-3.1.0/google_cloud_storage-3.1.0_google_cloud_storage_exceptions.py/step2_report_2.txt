  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code defines custom exception classes (`InvalidResponse` and `DataCorruption`) with conditional inheritance based on the availability of `google.resumable_media`.\n   - The classes store the `response` object as an attribute, which is typical for debugging.\n   - The import fallback to `Exception` is a standard pattern for backward compatibility.\n   - No external data flows, network activity, or data processing are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions with backward compatibility support. No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and analyze the code accurately.\n   - They recognize that the conditional inheritance is standard practice and does not introduce security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - Confidence is 1, justified by the clear, straightforward code and accurate analysis.\n\n**Suggestions:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks justifies a risk score above 0.5.\n   - The code is purely for exception handling with compatibility fallback.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustment needed; all scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - The only potential concern is the storage of the response object, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score remains 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their analysis on the code's structure and behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the purpose and nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exceptions with backward compatibility, and there are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.**",
