{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP response errors related to media transfer issues, maintaining backward compatibility with older versions of a library.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.resumable_media, initialization of exception classes, and their constructors.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and class instantiation, no external data or user input processed.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> class definitions -> exception class initialization -> exception instantiation with response objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for optional import, dynamic class inheritance based on import success, no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data, no obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes that extend either imported exceptions or base Exception class for compatibility. It employs conditional inheritance based on import success, which is standard practice for maintaining backward compatibility. No external input processing or network activity occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be well-structured, intended solely for error handling, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with backward compatibility considerations. It does not contain malware or security risks. It is benign and serves the purpose of exception management without any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
