  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to HTTP responses, with backward compatibility support for different library versions.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'google.resumable_media' and the response parameter in exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Storing the response object as an attribute; no external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of parent classes -> instantiation of exception with response -> storing response attribute; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import and inheritance for backward compatibility; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes that extend from dynamically imported parent classes, with fallback to Exception. The constructors accept a response object and optional args, store the response, and pass args to the superclass. This pattern is standard for maintaining backward compatibility. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for error handling in a library. No anomalies or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions with backward compatibility support. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The response object storage is typical for debugging purposes and does not indicate malicious intent.",
