  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific HTTP response errors related to media transfer and response validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.resumable_media, exception class initializations, and the response objects passed to exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Super calls within exception constructors, potential attribute assignments, and import error handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> exception class inheritance -> instantiation with response objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with fallback, conditional superclass initialization, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes with flexible inheritance based on the presence of a library. It handles import errors gracefully, falling back to Exception. The exception classes store the response object for debugging or handling purposes. No untrusted data processing, external network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is typical for library exception handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard exception class definitions for handling HTTP response errors, with safe fallback mechanisms. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It is a benign part of a larger library setup.",
