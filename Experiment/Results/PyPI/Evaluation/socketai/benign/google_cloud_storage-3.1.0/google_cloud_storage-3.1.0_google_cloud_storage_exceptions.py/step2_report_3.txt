  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the corresponding code in detail:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes with backward compatibility handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The logic is standard for Python exception handling, with conditional imports and inheritance.\n- Response objects are stored as attributes, which is typical and safe.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the description; no issues or vulnerabilities are detected.\n- No evidence of code injection, malicious intent, or security flaws.\n- The exception classes are well-structured and serve their purpose.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- None identified. The code appears correct, maintainable, and appropriate for its purpose.\n- The fallback to generic `Exception` in case of import failure is a common pattern for backward compatibility.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports, which is justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no higher scores are warranted.\n- The code is standard exception handling with compatibility logic, not risky or malicious.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume potential security issues due to dynamic import and exception handling, but these are standard practices.\n- No external data flows or untrusted input processing are present that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The report's scores are reasonable.\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured, safe implementation of custom exceptions with backward compatibility support. No security concerns are evident.",
