  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'google-cloud-storage', handling version loading, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'google/cloud/storage/version.py' via exec(), reads README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() to execute version.py content; no other untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Executes version.py content to set version variable; static reading of README; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on version.py, which could be risky if the file is compromised, but is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of exec() is standard but should be used with trusted files. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. Dependencies are legitimate, and the code structure is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured setup configuration with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for version loading, which is acceptable in controlled environments with trusted files.",
