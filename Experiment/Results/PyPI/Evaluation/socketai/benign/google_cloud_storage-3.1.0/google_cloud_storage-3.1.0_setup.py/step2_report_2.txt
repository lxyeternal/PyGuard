  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reads version via exec from version.py, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, considering the exec usage, but common in setup scripts.\n- **Comments:** The use of exec on version.py is typical but can be risky if the file is compromised. No malicious code detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Also a typical setup script, reads version info from version.py, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the report.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, standard practice.\n- **Comments:** No anomalies or suspicious code; use of exec is confined to version.py.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard setup, reads version and README, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1.\n- **Comments:** No suspicious behavior; standard pattern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, notes potential risk in executing version.py via exec, but common.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to mention of potential risk, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Comments:** Use of exec is typical but should be kept trusted.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected across all reports. The code performs standard package setup tasks, reads version info via exec (a common pattern), and reads static files.\n- **Use of exec:** While exec can be risky if the file is compromised, in this context, it's used solely to execute a trusted version.py file. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Dependencies and data flow:** All dependencies are legitimate, and data flows are straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Based on the code provided, no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The only concern is the use of exec, which is a known pattern but should be kept in trusted files.\n\n### Adjusted Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to exec usage, which is a common pattern in setup scripts but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or obfuscation. The use of exec is typical but should be maintained with trusted files.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or details are needed.",
