  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script for packaging; reads version via exec.\n- Sources: Reads version.py content via exec; no suspicious data.\n- Sinks: Uses exec on trusted file; no malicious code detected.\n- Flows: Data flows are straightforward; no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: Use of exec is common but can be risky if version.py is compromised.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. All dependencies and logic are standard.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate setup script; no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (slightly elevated due to exec, but acceptable in trusted context)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Sources: Reads version.py and README; no suspicious data.\n- Sinks: No data sinks or external code execution.\n- Flows: Static data; no untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: None detected; exec is used in a common pattern.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior; safe practices.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe setup script.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Package setup with metadata.\n- Sources: Reads version and README; no untrusted data.\n- Sinks: No suspicious sinks.\n- Flows: Data flows are static; no external code execution.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script; no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe and standard.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Package setup, reads version.py and README.\n- Sources: Reads version.py via exec, which could be risky if compromised.\n- Sinks: Uses data in setup; no code execution beyond exec.\n- Flows: Same as above; exec on version.py.\n- Anomalies: Use of exec is a minor concern if version.py is compromised.\n- Analysis: Common pattern; no malicious code observed.\n- Conclusion: Slight risk due to exec, but generally safe.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Package setup.\n- Sources: Reads version and README files; all static.\n- Sinks: No dangerous sinks.\n- Flows: No untrusted data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard setup script; safe practices.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code or behavior. The use of exec is standard in setup scripts for version loading, assuming the version.py file is trusted. No signs of backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to exec usage, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The use of exec on version.py is a known pattern but should be kept in a trusted environment. If the version.py file is verified to be unaltered and from a trusted source, the risk remains minimal.\n- No malware or suspicious activity detected across all reports.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to exec pattern, but overall low risk)\n\nThis setup script appears legitimate, standard, and safe. No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious activity.",
