  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script; reads version via exec() from a trusted file; no malicious code detected.\n- **Evaluation:** The use of exec() is common in setup scripts for dynamic version loading, assuming the version.py file is secure. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; security risk 0.2 seems slightly high but reflects awareness of exec() risks, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard package setup with version read via exec(); no suspicious behavior.\n- **Evaluation:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The confidence score is high.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup script.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script; reads version and README; no malicious code.\n- **Evaluation:** No anomalies or suspicious activity; use of exec() is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.1; appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate package configuration.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern; potential risk noted with exec() on version.py.\n- **Evaluation:** The use of exec() on version.py is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised. However, this is standard practice in many setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, but security risk 0.2 indicates some concern about exec().\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly higher concern due to exec(), but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup; reads version and README; no suspicious code.\n- **Evaluation:** No anomalies; safe practices followed.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe standard setup scripts; no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Use of exec():** Common in setup scripts for version loading; risk exists if the version.py file is compromised, but this is a known and accepted pattern.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to exec(), but justified given the context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- The use of exec() should be noted as a potential vector if the version.py file is compromised, but in controlled environments, this is standard.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (acceptable risk, primarily due to exec() usage, which is common in setup scripts but warrants caution if files are untrusted)\n\n**Summary:** The setup scripts are typical, well-structured, and do not exhibit malicious intent. The use of exec() is standard but should be maintained with trusted files to mitigate risks.",
