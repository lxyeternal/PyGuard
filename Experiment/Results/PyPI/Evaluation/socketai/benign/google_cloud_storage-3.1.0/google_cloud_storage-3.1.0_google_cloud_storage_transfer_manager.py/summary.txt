  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for concurrent media operations with no evidence of malicious activity. The main security concern is the use of pickle serialization, which could be exploited if untrusted data is deserialized. No malware or backdoors are detected. The risk score should be low to moderate, reflecting the serialization practices, but overall, the code is safe in a trusted environment."
