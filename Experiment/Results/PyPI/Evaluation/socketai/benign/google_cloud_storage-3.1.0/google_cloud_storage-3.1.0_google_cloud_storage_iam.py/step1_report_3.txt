{
  "purpose": "Defines IAM roles and permissions related to Google Cloud Storage.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause harm.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of static role and permission definitions with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions representing IAM roles and permissions for Google Cloud Storage. It includes role names and permission strings, with no dynamic code, user input handling, or external data processing. There are minor issues such as 'STORAGE_BUCKETS_UPDATE' assigned the same string as 'STORAGE_BUCKETS_LIST', which appears to be an error but is not malicious. No code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of IAM role and permission definitions intended for use in managing access controls. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only concern is a probable typo or misassignment in one of the permission constants, but this is not security-related.",
