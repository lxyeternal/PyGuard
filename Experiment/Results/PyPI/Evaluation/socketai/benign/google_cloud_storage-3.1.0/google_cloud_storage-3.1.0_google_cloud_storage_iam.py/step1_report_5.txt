  "purpose": "Defines IAM roles and permissions for Google Cloud Storage, specifying access levels for storage objects and buckets.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only constant string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external system interactions; purely constant definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward role and permission definitions without dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant string definitions for roles and permissions related to Google Cloud Storage. It includes role names and permission strings with descriptive comments. There are no input, output, or executable behaviors that could lead to data leakage, injection, or malicious activity. The code does not perform any runtime operations, network communication, or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, non-malicious definitions file for IAM roles and permissions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign configuration setup for access control.",
