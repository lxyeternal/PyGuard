  "purpose": "Define IAM roles and permissions related to Google Cloud Storage.",
  "sources": "Constants assignment statements defining roles and permissions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static constants with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard role and permission definitions. Minor typo in 'STORAGE_BUCKETS_UPDATE' value ('list' instead of 'update') may indicate a documentation mistake, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string assignments defining roles and permissions for Google Cloud Storage IAM policies. No input processing, data handling, or execution logic is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The minor inconsistency in the 'STORAGE_BUCKETS_UPDATE' permission value appears to be a documentation error, not malicious behavior. The file is license- and permission-definition metadata, typical for SDKs or API client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains static definitions of roles and permissions for GCP Storage IAM policies with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard, benign configuration or documentation file.",
