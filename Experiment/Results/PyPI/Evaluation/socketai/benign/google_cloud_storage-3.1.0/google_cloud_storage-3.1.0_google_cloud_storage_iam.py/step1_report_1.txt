  "purpose": "Define IAM roles and permissions related to Google Cloud Storage service.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read; only constant string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward documentation of IAM roles and permissions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string constants for roles and permissions associated with Google Cloud Storage. All definitions are static and serve as configuration or reference data. There are no dynamic inputs, network operations, or executable logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The licensing and copyright comments are standard and do not influence runtime behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static set of constants defining IAM roles and permissions for Google Cloud Storage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate documentation or configuration code.",
