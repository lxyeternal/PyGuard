  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is static, only defining constants for IAM roles and permissions. No data flows, no dynamic code, no network activity, no suspicious constructs.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that there's no malicious behavior or security risk is accurate. The confidence level is 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar static definitions. Minor typo noted in `'STORAGE_BUCKETS_UPDATE'` assigned the value `'storage.buckets.list'` instead of `'storage.buckets.update'`. This appears to be a documentation or copy-paste mistake, not malicious.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or security issues. The typo is a documentation mistake.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The small risk score might be slightly high considering it's just a typo in a constant, but since it could cause misconfiguration, a small risk score is acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, static constants. Minor issue similar to Report 2—`STORAGE_BUCKETS_UPDATE` assigned `'storage.buckets.list'`.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior. The typo is likely an error, not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The risk score is minimal, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Static definitions, no dynamic code or data flow.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or security concern.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—static constants, no data flow, no malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, static nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with some small increases (0.1) due to minor typos that could cause misconfigurations but are not security threats.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code is purely static, defining constants for IAM roles and permissions.\n- No dynamic code, no network operations, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- The small typo in some permission strings is a documentation/configuration error, not malicious.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk; minor typo does not constitute a security issue)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The code is benign, purely definitional, and does not pose security concerns.",
