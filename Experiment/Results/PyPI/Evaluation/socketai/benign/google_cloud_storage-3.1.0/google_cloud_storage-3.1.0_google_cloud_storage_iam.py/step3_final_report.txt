  "purpose": "Static definitions of IAM roles and permissions for Google Cloud Storage, intended for access control configuration.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining roles and permissions; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static constants with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in 'STORAGE_BUCKETS_UPDATE' assigned 'storage.buckets.list' instead of 'storage.buckets.update', likely a documentation or copy-paste mistake.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining IAM roles and permissions. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors. The minor typo identified does not impact security but should be corrected for accuracy. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The code is purely configuration data with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free from malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor typo is a documentation or implementation mistake, not a security concern. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature. No further security action is necessary.",
