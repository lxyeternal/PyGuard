  "purpose": "Parse Label Studio XML configuration strings to extract structured information about controls, inputs, outputs, labels, and conditionals for use in annotation and ML model relevance.",
  "sources": "Input XML configuration string, reading tags and attributes during parsing.",
  "sinks": "Logging statements for debugging and info; exception raising on XML syntax errors.",
  "flows": "Input string -> parse XML -> iterate over tags -> identify control/input/output tags -> extract attributes -> build structured output data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; regex in has_variable() is straightforward; no external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard XML parsing with lxml, extracting relevant attributes for Label Studio configs. It handles nested tags, conditionals, variables, and logging appropriately. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. Regex for variable detection is safe. Exception handling is proper. The code is read-only regarding input data, with no network or system modifications. Overall, it is a benign, well-structured parser with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard parser for Label Studio configurations with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the malware score remains at 0. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, confirming the code's benign nature.",
