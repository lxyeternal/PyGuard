  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing local and remote files, URL resolution, caching, and downloading within Label Studio environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LABEL_STUDIO_URL, LABEL_STUDIO_HOST, LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY, LABEL_STUDIO_ACCESS_TOKEN), URL inputs, local file paths, environment variables for tokens and hostnames.",
  "sinks": "File system (local paths), network requests to download files, local cache storage.",
  "flows": "URL inputs -> URL processing and environment variable resolution -> local file checks or download -> caching -> returning local file path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; standard URL handling, environment variable usage, and file operations. No obfuscation or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for handling file URLs, local storage, and remote downloads with caching. It uses environment variables for configuration, constructs URLs for cloud storage, and performs network requests with appropriate headers. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The potential security concerns relate to external URL handling and environment variable reliance, which are typical for such utilities but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource management utility with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is low, primarily related to external inputs, which is standard for such modules. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical concerns with external URL handling and environment variables.",
