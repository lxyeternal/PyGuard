{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing local and remote files, especially in the context of Label Studio, including downloading, caching, and resolving URLs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LABEL_STUDIO_URL, LABEL_STUDIO_HOST, LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY, LABEL_STUDIO_ACCESS_TOKEN); URL parameters; local file system; user input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Downloading files via HTTP requests; copying files within local directories; reading from environment variables; writing to cache directory.",
  "flows": "Input URLs are processed to determine their type; local files are loaded directly or copied; remote URLs are downloaded with optional authorization; local or cloud storage URLs are reconstructed and accessed accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials; the code dynamically constructs URLs and handles various file sources, but no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. Usage of access tokens and hostname resolution appears standard. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles different types of file sources, including local storage, uploads, and cloud storage, with appropriate URL transformations and local caching. It incorporates environment variable configurations for hostname and API keys, with proper fallbacks and warnings for localhost. The download process includes standard headers and optional authorization tokens, aligning with expected security practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are evident. The code does not perform any suspicious actions beyond typical file management and network requests, and no malicious signals or anomalies are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for managing files in Label Studio, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or supply chain attacks. It follows standard practices for URL handling, caching, and environment variable usage. Overall, it is a safe and typical implementation for its purpose.",
