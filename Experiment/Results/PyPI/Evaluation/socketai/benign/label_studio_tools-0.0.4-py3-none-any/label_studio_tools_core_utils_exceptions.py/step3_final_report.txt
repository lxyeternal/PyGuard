  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific XML syntax errors in Label Studio, likely to be ignored by error tracking systems.",
  "sources": "Class declaration inheriting from Exception; no data input, output, or external calls.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or interact externally.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class inheriting from Exception with no additional logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The class name suggests usage for error handling, but this is standard practice. No external interactions or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; no adjustments are necessary.",
