  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for ignoring specific syntax errors in Label Studio XML processing.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself; no data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; only class declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns; this is a straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition inheriting from Exception, used to represent a specific error type related to Label Studio XML syntax errors ignored by Sentry. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious behaviors. It does not perform any operations, external communication, or data handling. The code is minimal and standard for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
