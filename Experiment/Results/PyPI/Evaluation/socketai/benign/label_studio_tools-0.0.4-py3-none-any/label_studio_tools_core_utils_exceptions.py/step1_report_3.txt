  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for ignoring specific syntax errors related to Label Studio XML.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception with no additional logic or data handling. It contains no input processing, no data output, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The class name suggests it is used for specific error handling in a larger application context, but on its own, it does not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a custom exception class. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
