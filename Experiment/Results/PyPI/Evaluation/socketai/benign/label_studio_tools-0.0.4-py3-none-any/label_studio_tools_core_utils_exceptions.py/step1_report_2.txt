  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named LabelStudioXMLSyntaxErrorSentryIgnored",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code solely defines a class",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code is only a class definition",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with no unusual constructs or secrets; no suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single exception class inheriting from Exception, with no additional methods or attributes. It contains no data input, output, network activity, or suspicious logic. The class name suggests it might be used for handling specific XML syntax errors related to Label Studio, with some sentry ignore logic implied, but there is no implementation detail indicating malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign class definition with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
