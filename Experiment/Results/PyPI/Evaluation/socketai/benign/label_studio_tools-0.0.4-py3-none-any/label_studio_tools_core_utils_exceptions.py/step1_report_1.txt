  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for ignoring specific XML syntax errors in Label Studio.",
  "sources": "None, as the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, no data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a straightforward class definition with no unusual constructs or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception, intended to represent ignored syntax errors in Label Studio XML processing. It contains no data reading, data writing, or external interactions. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is present. It is a simple class declaration, typical in Python for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a specific purpose in error handling within a larger application.",
