  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Scores are appropriately cautious, with malware set at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.4, and security risk at 0.45. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants ongoing review if further code is provided."
