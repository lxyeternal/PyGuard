  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, subprocess calls, network functions, dynamic code execution points, data input points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, subprocess execution, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, subprocess), possibly via dynamic code execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, unvalidated subprocess/network calls, suspicious pattern of data handling without concrete malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, which could be used maliciously, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. No hardcoded secrets or direct malicious payloads are evident. The suspicion is moderate, justified by patterns rather than confirmed exploits. The absence of concrete malicious code leads to cautious scoring. The overall structure and behavior do not indicate active malware but warrant monitoring if more code becomes available.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Scores are appropriately cautious, with malware set at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.4, and security risk at 0.45. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants ongoing review if further code is provided.",
