  "purpose": "Analysis of potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks in the provided Python code or reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, untrusted data inputs, dynamic code execution (eval), configuration files, setup routines.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, file writes, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted inputs flow into eval or network functions, possibly leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec functions, obfuscation indicators, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, unusual variable usage, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code or reports indicate that Report 1 contains obfuscated code with eval usage and untrusted data handling, justifying a malware score of 0.3 and obfuscation score of 0.4, with a moderate security risk of 0.45. Other reports lack code or suspicious patterns, with scores of zero or very low, consistent with benign assessments. The scores reflect the evidence, with potential for moderate risk in Report 1 due to dynamic execution and obfuscation, but no confirmed malicious payloads. Minor score adjustments could be made to lower risk in reports lacking code, but current scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports' scores are consistent with their analyses. Report 1 warrants a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score due to indicators like eval and obfuscation, but without confirmed malicious payloads, the current scores are appropriate. Other reports correctly reflect benign or insufficient evidence. The security posture based on these assessments remains cautious but justified.",
