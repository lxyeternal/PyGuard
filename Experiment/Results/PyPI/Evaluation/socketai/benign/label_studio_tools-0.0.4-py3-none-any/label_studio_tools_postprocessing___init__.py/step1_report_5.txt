{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the import and setup of dependencies, along with some configuration or initialization routines, potentially for a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, imports external modules, and possibly reads files or network resources if present in unseen parts of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources into functions or modules, which may pass data to sinks such as network sockets, files, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network addresses are observed. The code structure appears standard, with no obvious backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python import statements and possibly configuration routines. There are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Since only the import/setup section is visible, the risk of malicious activity is low. No anomalous behaviors like hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity are apparent from the provided code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard setup code for a Python project without malicious intent.",
