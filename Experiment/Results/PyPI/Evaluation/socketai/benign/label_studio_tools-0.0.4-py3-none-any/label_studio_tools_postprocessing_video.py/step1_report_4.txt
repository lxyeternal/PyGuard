{
  "purpose": "The code extracts key frames from video annotation results and constructs interpolated frames between keyframes for annotation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads annotation results, including sequences of frames and their properties such as 'x', 'y', 'rotation', 'width', 'height', 'time', and 'enabled'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data leading to security-sensitive operations like file writing, network transmission, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'results' into deep copies and processing functions; interpolated frame data is generated and returned, but no untrusted external sink (e.g., network or system call) is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to perform standard data processing without suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The logic is straightforward and focused on interpolation.",
  "analysis": "The script processes annotation data to generate intermediate frames, ensuring data integrity and smooth interpolation between keyframes. It relies on standard Python features and external configuration (_VIDEO_TRACKING_TAGS). No external inputs are directly used in insecure ways, and no network or file operations are present. The use of deepcopy and sorting functions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code does not execute any system commands or perform network communication. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate utility function for video annotation processing without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for keyframe interpolation in video annotation workflows. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, nor does it present significant security risks. The code is well-structured and appears safe for use.",
