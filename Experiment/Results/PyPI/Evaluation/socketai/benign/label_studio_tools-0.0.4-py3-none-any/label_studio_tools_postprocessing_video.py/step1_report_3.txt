{
  "purpose": "The code extracts key frames from video annotation results, interpolating frames between annotated keyframes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameter 'results' and its nested structures, especially 'sequence', 'value', and frame attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data for security-sensitive operations like network or file access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'results' through deep copies, processing in '_construct_result_from_frames', and ultimately outputs modified frame sequences.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive deep copying and interpolation, but no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes structured data representing video frames and annotations, performing sorting, interpolation, and conditional logic. No indications of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs are present. Usage of deep copies and standard libraries is benign. No insecure data handling or system-level operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for processing video annotation data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate data processing script without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
