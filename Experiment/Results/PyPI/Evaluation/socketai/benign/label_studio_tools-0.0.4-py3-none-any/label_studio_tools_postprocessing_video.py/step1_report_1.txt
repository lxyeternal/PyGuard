{
  "purpose": "The code processes video annotation results to extract key frames and interpolate intermediate frames, primarily for labeling or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'results' parameter passed into extract_key_frames, specifically from 'results' list elements, and from nested dictionary keys such as 'sequence', 'value', 'frame', and 'enabled'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to security vulnerabilities are present; the code mainly manipulates data internally without external system calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'results' through deep copying and sorting; frames are processed via _construct_result_from_frames, which interpolates values and constructs new frame data. No external sinks or network activity are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of deep copies and sorting is standard; no obfuscation or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to extract key frames from video annotation data, manipulating nested dictionaries and lists. It sorts sequences, interpolates frame data linearly, and manages flags like 'enabled'. The logic appears consistent with typical data processing tasks. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are found. The code operates within a controlled scope, performing data transformations without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data processing for video annotation frames without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is clean, predictable, and does not include any malicious payloads or suspicious logic.",
