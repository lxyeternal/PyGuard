{
  "purpose": "The code processes video annotation results to extract key frames and generate intermediate frames with interpolated attributes.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'results' parameter in 'extract_key_frames' and properties within each result such as 'sequence', 'frame', 'enabled', and various attributes like 'x', 'y', 'rotation', 'width', 'height', 'time'.",
  "sinks": "Potential modification of 'result' dictionaries within '_construct_result_from_frames', possibly affecting downstream data processing or storage, but no direct sink for untrusted data (e.g., network or file operations) is present.",
  "flows": "Results are deep-copied, processed, and augmented within loops. No external or network flows are observed; data flows from input 'results' through processing functions to output 'final_results'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or backdoors. Usage of 'deepcopy' and lambda functions appears standard. No external data sources, network calls, or insecure practices are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks: copying data structures, sorting sequences, and interpolating attributes across frames. It does not execute any external commands, perform network operations, or handle sensitive credentials. The interpolation logic is straightforward, and the data transformations are within expected bounds. No unusual or malicious behavior is evident. The structure and functions are typical for video processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard implementation for extracting and interpolating video frames based on annotation data, with no suspicious activities or security concerns detected.",
