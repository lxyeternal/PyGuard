  "purpose": "Process video annotation results to extract key frames and interpolate intermediate frames for smooth tracking.",
  "sources": "Input annotation results, specifically the 'sequence' data within each result object.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Results are deep-copied, sorted, and interpolated between frames; no external data flow or untrusted input handling beyond internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing: copying, sorting, and interpolating frame data for video annotations. It includes interpolation logic that calculates intermediate frame attributes linearly. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The interpolation ensures smooth transition between key frames. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The use of deep copies and sorting is safe and standard. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical data processing for video frame interpolation. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
