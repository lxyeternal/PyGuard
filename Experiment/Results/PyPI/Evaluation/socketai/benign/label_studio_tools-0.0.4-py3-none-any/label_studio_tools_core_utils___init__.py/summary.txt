  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but reports 2 and 5 show obfuscation and unsafe practices that could indicate malicious intent. Slightly increasing malware scores for these reports reflects the suspicion without overestimating risk. Overall, the assessments are appropriate, with recommendations for marginal score adjustments based on observed patterns."
