  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency security reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall risk, and improve the most suitable report.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data (environment variables, user input), system/network calls, and data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network endpoints, file operations, or other sensitive functions where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (system/network operations), potentially without validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious indicators or obfuscation. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, with low to moderate security risk (0.2–0.3). Confidence levels vary from high (0.9) to moderate (0.4), depending on code context and analysis thoroughness. No discrepancies or overlooked issues are evident. For Report 5, potential security concerns from untrusted data handling justify slightly increasing the security risk score from 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting cautious assessment of possible vulnerabilities without confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are generally accurate and consistent. No evidence of malware or obfuscation exists. The security risk scores are appropriate but can be marginally increased for reports involving unvalidated inputs. Final recommended scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.4 for Report 5, with others remaining unchanged.",
