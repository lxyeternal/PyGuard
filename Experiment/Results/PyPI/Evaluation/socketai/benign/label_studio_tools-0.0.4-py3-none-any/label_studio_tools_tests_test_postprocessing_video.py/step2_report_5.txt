  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The report states the code is purely test cases with static data, no external sources, no network calls, no suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward test code, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the static nature of the test data, no external dependencies, and standard testing practices.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, no malicious indicators.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is standard unit tests with static data, no external or malicious behaviors.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n- **Assessment:** No concerns here.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above—benign test code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with prior assessments; static data, no external interactions, no malicious intent.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is purely test code with static, hardcoded data.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The purpose is solely to verify the correctness of the `extract_key_frames` function.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** All are 0, as the code poses no security threat.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard set of unit tests with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and poses no security risk. It is purely testing logic for a known, trusted function.",
