{
  "purpose": "The code contains multiple test functions for verifying the behavior of the 'extract_key_frames' function from the 'label_studio_tools.postprocessing.video' module, specifically testing frame extraction logic under various scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from predefined example dictionaries within each test case.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no external network or file system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is fed directly into the 'extract_key_frames' function; the flow is internal to the test code, with no data going to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists solely of test cases with static data and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a series of test functions that create sample input data and call 'extract_key_frames' to verify its output against expected values. The test data is static and hardcoded, used solely for validation. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data sources are involved. No network connections, file operations, or other side effects are observed. The presence of multiple assertions confirms that the code is designed for testing correctness rather than malicious activity. Overall, the code is straightforward test code with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign test cases for a video frame extraction function. It does not include any malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or external interactions. The code is standard testing logic verifying expected outputs based on static input data.",
