  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of unit tests with static, hardcoded data. There are no indications of external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The tests verify the behavior of the `extract_key_frames` function under various scenarios, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis, emphasizing the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. They correctly identify that the code is standard testing code with no malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports and the code itself indicate no malicious behavior, no justification exists for assigning higher risk scores. The code is purely for testing and does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions about vulnerabilities; they base their conclusions on the static, controlled nature of the test data and the absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis, indicating no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no signs of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a set of well-structured, static unit tests for a specific function. There are no external dependencies, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or malicious patterns. The purpose is solely to verify expected behavior, and all evidence points to a benign, safe codebase.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
