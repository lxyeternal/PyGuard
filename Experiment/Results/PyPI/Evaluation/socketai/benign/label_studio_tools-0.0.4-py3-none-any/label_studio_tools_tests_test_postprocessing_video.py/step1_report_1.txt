{
  "purpose": "The code contains test cases for the 'extract_key_frames' function, validating its behavior with various input scenarios involving video frame sequences.",
  "sources": "Input data for 'extract_key_frames' function, provided as 'example' objects within each test case.",
  "sinks": "The function 'extract_key_frames' itself is a dependency, but no external untrusted sources, network calls, or data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'extract_key_frames', and output is validated through assertions; no untrusted data manipulation or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists solely of test functions with predictable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a series of unit tests verifying the behavior of the 'extract_key_frames' function using various input scenarios, including enabled/disabled frames, frame counts, and edge cases. All data is hardcoded within the test cases. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The tests check for expected output consistency and handle various normal and boundary conditions. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as backdoors or hidden behaviors, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate testing code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely tests a video frame extraction function with controlled data inputs. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
