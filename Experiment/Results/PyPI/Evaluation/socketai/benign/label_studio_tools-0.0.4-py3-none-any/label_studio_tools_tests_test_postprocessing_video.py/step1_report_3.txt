{
  "purpose": "The code contains multiple test functions that validate the behavior of the 'extract_key_frames' function from the 'label_studio_tools.postprocessing.video' module. It primarily tests frame extraction logic for various input scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data embedded within each test function, specifically the 'example' data structures representing video annotation sequences.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident as the code does not process untrusted input or perform any output operations; it only calls an imported function and asserts expected results.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'example' test data into 'extract_key_frames', then to assertions verifying frame properties; no external untrusted data or user input is involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code appears to be standard unit testing code for a specific function.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of multiple test functions that validate the output of 'extract_key_frames' given various input scenarios. All data used are static, hardcoded within test functions, and there are no indications of malicious payloads, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure is typical for unit tests, with no suspicious code constructs, no use of eval or exec, and no network operations. The function under test is imported from a trusted library, and the tests do not manipulate external systems or secrets. Therefore, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for a video frame extraction function. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe, and its purpose is to validate expected behavior of the referenced function with different input scenarios.",
