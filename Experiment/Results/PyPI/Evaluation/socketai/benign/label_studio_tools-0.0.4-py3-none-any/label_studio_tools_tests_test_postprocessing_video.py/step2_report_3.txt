  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All five reports explicitly state that the code consists solely of unit tests with static, hardcoded data. They note the absence of external inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or any suspicious patterns such as backdoors, secrets, or malicious payloads. The tests are straightforward, verifying the behavior of the `extract_key_frames` function.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**  \n   The provided code is a series of test functions that create specific input scenarios for `extract_key_frames`. The data used is static, designed to validate various edge cases and typical behaviors. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Given the analysis, this is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable test code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified since there's no evidence of security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or external threats.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**  \n   The only aspect to consider is whether the function under test (`extract_key_frames`) could be malicious. However, since it is imported from a trusted library (`label_studio_tools.postprocessing.video`) and the test data is static, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is purely for testing purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks evident.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard testing code verifying expected behavior of a function with static data. There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores of zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. No adjustments are necessary.",
