{
  "purpose": "The code contains unit tests for the 'extract_key_frames' function, designed to verify its behavior with various input scenarios involving frame sequences and enabled/disabled states.",
  "sources": "Static, hardcoded input data within test functions, including frame sequences and associated attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external inputs or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The test data flows into the 'extract_key_frames' function, and the assertions verify the output sequences without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward test code with static data and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static unit tests with predefined input data, verifying expected outputs of a trusted function. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The tests include assertions on sequence length, frame attributes, and presence of 'auto' flags, all consistent with benign testing practices. The function 'extract_key_frames' is imported from a known library, and the data used is typical for video frame annotation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for testing purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the safe and static nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
