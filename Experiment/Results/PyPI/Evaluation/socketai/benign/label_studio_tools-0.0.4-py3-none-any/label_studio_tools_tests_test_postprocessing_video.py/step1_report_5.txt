{
  "purpose": "The code contains a series of test functions for verifying the behavior of the 'extract_key_frames' function from the 'label_studio_tools.postprocessing.video' module, focusing on different scenarios of frame sequences and enabled/disabled states.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures (examples) defined within the test functions; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'extract_key_frames', which processes input data, but does not involve external data sinks such as network or file output; it simply processes data in memory.",
  "flows": "Input data structures flow into 'extract_key_frames' function, which produces processed sequences; no untrusted data flow or external side effects are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard unit tests for data processing logic with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit test functions that define specific input scenarios for the 'extract_key_frames' function and perform assertions to verify correct behavior. There are no external inputs, network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution. The code only manipulates static data, ensuring controlled testing conditions. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The test data and assertions are straightforward, aiming to verify the correctness of frame extraction logic under various conditions. Overall, this is benign testing code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for a video frame extraction function. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external data handling beyond static test data, and no obfuscated or harmful code segments. The code's purpose is solely to validate functional correctness. It poses no security threat or malware risk.",
