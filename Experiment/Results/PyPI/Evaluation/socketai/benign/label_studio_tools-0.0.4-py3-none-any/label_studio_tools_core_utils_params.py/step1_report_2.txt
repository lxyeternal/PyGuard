  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve boolean and string environment variables and request parameters with validation.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables), params.get (request parameters)",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, no data is written or transmitted externally within this code.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or request parameters is processed and returned, but no external data flows occur beyond local variable handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses string-to-boolean conversion with common true/false mappings. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected. The function 'cast_bool_from_str' correctly handles string inputs. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to extract boolean and string values from request parameters and environment variables, considering multiple environment variable name prefixes. It uses safe string matching and conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor implementation. It appears to be a standard utility module for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a configuration helper for environment variables and request parameters. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected.",
