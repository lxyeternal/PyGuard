  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving boolean values from request parameters and environment variables with multiple prefixes.",
  "sources": "os.environ for environment variables; params.get for request parameters",
  "sinks": "Return values used for application configuration and logic decisions",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or request parameters flow into boolean parsing functions and are returned for use",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward handling; potential minor misconfiguration risk due to multiple prefixes but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple, standard utility functions for configuration management, including boolean parsing and environment variable retrieval with multiple prefixes. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The boolean parsing correctly interprets common string representations. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The environment variable lookup with multiple prefixes could pose a misconfiguration risk but is a common pattern. Error handling in cast_bool_from_str raises exceptions on invalid input, which is acceptable. Overall, the code is clear, safe, and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for configuration retrieval, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores are justified and reflect typical configuration handling risks, not malicious intent.",
