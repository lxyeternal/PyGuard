{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for retrieving boolean and string environment variables, possibly for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables via os.environ.get() and user-supplied parameters via the params dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables are accessed, but no data is written back or transmitted externally; no external network or system modification is performed.",
  "flows": "User input in params is processed and converted to boolean values; environment variables are read and returned, potentially influenced by external environment settings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code's logic for boolean conversion is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious payload detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves configuration values from environment variables or request parameters, converting strings to booleans with proper validation. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. It does not perform any external network operations, file modifications, or sensitive data handling beyond environment variable access. The use of environment variables with prefixes suggests configurable behavior, but nothing malicious is present. The functions are straightforward and do not contain hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration utility for retrieving environment variables and request parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code's design is typical and safe for intended use.",
