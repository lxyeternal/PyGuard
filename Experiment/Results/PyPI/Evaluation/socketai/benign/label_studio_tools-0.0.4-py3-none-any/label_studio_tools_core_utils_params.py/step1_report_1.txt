  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to retrieve boolean and string environment variables or request parameters, supporting multiple naming conventions and default values.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables), params.get() (request parameters) via bool_from_request()",
  "sinks": "Returning values from get_env() and bool_from_request(), which could influence application behavior based on external input",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or request parameters flows into bool_from_request() and get_env(), then to return statements affecting application configuration",
  "anomalies": "The get_env() function uses environment variables with multiple prefixes, potentially leading to unintended configuration overrides; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is evident. The use of environment variables is typical, but potential for misconfiguration exists.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to parse boolean values from request parameters and environment variables. The function cast_bool_from_str() correctly interprets common boolean string representations. get_env() searches multiple environment variable keys for configuration, which is a standard pattern but may introduce complexity or misconfiguration if environment variables are manipulated maliciously. The functions do not perform any data processing that could lead to code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions. No suspicious behavior such as network communication, file operations, or code execution is present. The code structure is straightforward and does not obfuscate logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for configuration retrieval from environment variables and request parameters. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident. It appears safe, assuming the environment variables are managed securely and the parameters are validated at higher levels. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected.",
