  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving boolean and string environment variables and request parameters with type casting.",
  "sources": "os.environ for environment variables; params.get for request parameters",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions (cast_bool_from_str) and environment variable retrieval, which may influence application behavior based on external input",
  "flows": "Input data from os.environ or params → cast_bool_from_str or direct return → influence application configuration or logic flow",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious URL or network activity; use of environment variables and request parameters is standard. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for extracting boolean and string data from environment variables and request parameters, with proper type conversions and validation. It uses standard libraries (os) and safe string comparisons. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads are evident. The functions do not perform network operations, file modifications, or execute system commands beyond retrieving environment variables and parameters. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility functions for configuration management, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected. It follows common patterns for safe environment and request data handling.",
