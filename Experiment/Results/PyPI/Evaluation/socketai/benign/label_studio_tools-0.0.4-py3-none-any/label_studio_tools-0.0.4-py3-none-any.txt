Scores are appropriately cautious, with malware set at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.4, and security risk at 0.45. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants ongoing review if further code is provided."

Report 1 warrants a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score due to indicators like eval and obfuscation, but without confirmed malicious payloads, the current scores are appropriate. Other reports correctly reflect benign or insufficient evidence. The security posture based on these assessments remains cautious but justified."
