  "purpose": "Compatibility wrapper for pytest marker retrieval, ensuring support across pytest versions.",
  "sources": "The 'item' object and method calls ('get_closest_marker' / 'get_marker').",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network calls, or data processing beyond internal method calls.",
  "flows": "Method calls on 'item' object; no untrusted data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard exception handling for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve a pytest marker using 'get_closest_marker' and falls back to 'get_marker' if an AttributeError occurs, indicating an older pytest version. It involves simple method calls on the 'item' object with exception handling, no external data or network activity, and no malicious or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, compatibility utility with no security concerns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign compatibility wrapper for pytest marker retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate.",
