{
  "purpose": "Retrieve a specific pytest marker from a test item, ensuring compatibility across different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'item' object and the 'name' string parameter to access markers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is being sent to external systems, files, or network sources.",
  "flows": "Input 'item' and 'name' are used to call methods that access marker information; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses exception handling to maintain compatibility with older pytest versions, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if 'item' has the method 'get_closest_marker'. If it does, it calls it; otherwise, it falls back to 'get_marker'. This approach ensures compatibility with different pytest versions. The code only accesses attributes/methods of the 'item' object and handles AttributeError exceptions, which is typical and safe. No external data, user input, or network activity occurs. The purpose is purely to retrieve metadata from pytest test items.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, compatible code for pytest marker retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
