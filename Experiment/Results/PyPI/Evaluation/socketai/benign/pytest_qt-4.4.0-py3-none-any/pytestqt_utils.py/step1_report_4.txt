{
  "purpose": "Retrieve a marker from a pytest item, maintaining compatibility across pytest versions.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'item' parameter and accesses its methods 'get_closest_marker' or 'get_marker'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed or output; the code solely interacts with the 'item' object.",
  "flows": "The function attempts to call 'item.get_closest_marker(name)'; if it raises AttributeError, it calls 'item.get_marker(name)'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code adapts method calls based on attribute availability, which is standard compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple compatibility wrapper for pytest marker retrieval. It attempts to call 'get_closest_marker', and if an AttributeError occurs (likely due to an older pytest version), it falls back to 'get_marker'. This approach ensures compatibility without executing any external or malicious code. No suspicious or malicious logic, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not perform any network operations, handle untrusted input beyond method calls, or include obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility helper for pytest marker retrieval. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
