{
  "purpose": "Retrieve a pytest marker from an item object, maintaining compatibility with different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "The 'item' parameter passed into the function, specifically calling 'get_closest_marker' or 'get_marker' methods on it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or malicious effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input 'item' is read to access its methods; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to call two different methods based on exception handling, which is standard for compatibility, with no suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The function simply checks for a marker in a pytest item object, first trying 'get_closest_marker' and falling back to 'get_marker' if AttributeError occurs. This is a compatibility pattern for different pytest versions. No external data inputs are read directly, and there are no side effects or security-sensitive operations. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, version-compatible retrieval of a pytest marker without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard compatibility utility function with no suspicious elements.",
