{
  "purpose": "Retrieve a pytest marker from a test item, ensuring compatibility with different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'item' object and attempts to access marker information through 'get_closest_marker' or 'get_marker' methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'item' is checked for marker retrieval methods; no untrusted data flow beyond method calls, which are internal to pytest objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code simply manages method compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that attempts to retrieve a marker from a pytest item, first using 'get_closest_marker' and falling back to 'get_marker' for older pytest versions. It employs a try-except block to handle AttributeError, indicating version compatibility. There are no external data sources, no network or system modifications, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and limited to internal API calls within pytest objects, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple compatibility wrapper for pytest marker retrieval. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is standard and purpose-driven without suspicious features.",
