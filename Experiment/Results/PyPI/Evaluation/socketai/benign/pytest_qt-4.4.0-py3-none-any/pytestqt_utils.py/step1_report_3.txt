  "purpose": "Retrieve a marker from a pytest item for compatibility with different pytest versions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'item' which is a pytest test item object, and 'name' which is the marker name.",
  "sinks": "Return value is directly from method calls on 'item'; no external untrusted data or output effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'item' and 'name' -> method call on 'item' (get_closest_marker or get_marker) -> return marker object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling to maintain backward compatibility; no suspicious or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The function simply attempts to call 'get_closest_marker' on 'item', and if AttributeError occurs (indicating older pytest versions), it falls back to 'get_marker'. Both methods are typical API calls for pytest objects. No data manipulation, network access, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a compatibility shim for pytest marker retrieval and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward, benign utility function.",
