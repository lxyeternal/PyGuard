  "purpose": "Define the package version based on setuptools_scm's versioning system.",
  "sources": "Importing 'version' from 'pytestqt._version' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "Import from 'pytestqt._version' -> assign to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from an internal module and assigns it to '__version__'. This is standard practice for version management. No external data input, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior present. The module appears to be a simple version declaration script, likely auto-generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
