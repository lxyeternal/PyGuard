{
  "purpose": "Define the package version based on an external version source managed by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from pytestqt._version import version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The imported 'version' is assigned directly to '__version__', with no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module, likely auto-generated during the build process by setuptools_scm. It then assigns this value to the '__version__' variable for package versioning purposes. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior detected. The code is minimal and typical for version assignment in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is standard for managing package version information and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
