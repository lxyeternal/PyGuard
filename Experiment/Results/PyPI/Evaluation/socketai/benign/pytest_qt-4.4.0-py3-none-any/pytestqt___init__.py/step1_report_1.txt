{
  "purpose": "To define the package version based on the version provided by the setuptools_scm tool, which automatically manages versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from pytestqt._version import version'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; code only imports and assigns a version variable.",
  "flows": "The imported 'version' is assigned to '__version__', establishing a version identifier for the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module within 'pytestqt'. It then assigns this imported version to the '__version__' attribute for package identification. There is no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code serves a standard purpose of version management. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate version assignment mechanism with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
