  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\n# _version is automatically generated by setuptools_scm\nfrom pytestqt._version import version\n\n__version__ = version\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code simply imports a `version` string from a local module `pytestqt._version` and assigns it to `__version__`.\n- There are no user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data sinks.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated or part of standard version management practices.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n- They correctly identify that the code is used for version management, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' reasoning is sound and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores seem reasonable and consistent across reports. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n- Since the code is purely for version assignment with no malicious or risky behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware score considerations**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of scores with the report**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward version assignment, auto-generated or standard, with no malicious intent or security issues.**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a minimal, negligible risk, mainly because it's auto-generated, but still very low)\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nWhile the code is safe, I assign a tiny risk score (0.1) just to acknowledge that auto-generated code can sometimes have undisclosed issues, but in this case, there's nothing suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and standard.  \n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.  \n- No further action needed.",
