{
  "purpose": "This code imports a version string from an internal module generated by setuptools_scm and assigns it to __version__, serving as a standard version management pattern in Python packages.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pytestqt._version module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import of version from internal module to __version__ variable",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard pattern for defining package version, importing a version string from an internal module. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The module pytestqt._version is likely auto-generated by setuptools_scm. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for version management, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
