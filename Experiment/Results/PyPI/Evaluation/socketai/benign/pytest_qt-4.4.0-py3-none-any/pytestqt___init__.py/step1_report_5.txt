{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from an internal module to set the package's __version__ attribute, likely for version tracking.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from pytestqt._version import version' – reading the internal module to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources are present; the code only assigns a variable.",
  "flows": "The source 'version' from 'pytestqt._version' flows into the __version__ variable, but there are no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and involves standard version assignment with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from an internal module of the package, which is standard practice for maintaining versioning. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, or code execution involved. The module path appears legitimate, and the operation is simple attribute assignment. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version assignment statement, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a typical pattern used in Python packaging.",
