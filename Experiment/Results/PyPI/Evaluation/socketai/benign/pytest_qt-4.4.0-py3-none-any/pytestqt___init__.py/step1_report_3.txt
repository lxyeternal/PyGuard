  "purpose": "Define the package version by importing it from an external module generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'version' from 'pytestqt._version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not handle input or output operations.",
  "flows": "Import of 'version' from a module; assignment to '__version__'. No data flow from external sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a standard package-generated module and assigns it to the '__version__' variable. It relies on an external, presumably trusted, versioning system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The structure is minimal and standard for package versioning. The imported module is part of the 'pytestqt' package, which is an open-source testing utility, indicating this is a typical version assignment without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply assigns a version string from an external module to the '__version__' variable, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for version management in Python packages.",
