  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n# _version is automatically generated by setuptools_scm\nfrom pytestqt._version import version\n\n__version__ = version\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- The code simply imports a `version` string from a local module `pytestqt._version` and assigns it to `__version__`.\n- No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or external data handling occurs.\n- The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices for version management in Python packages.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent, each emphasizing that the code is a standard, auto-generated version assignment.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data sinks, no suspicious patterns, and no anomalies.\n- The reasoning is sound; all reports correctly interpret the purpose and behavior of the code.\n\n**Potential concern:**  \nAll reports are very similar, which suggests they might be generated from a template or automated system. This isn't inherently problematic but worth noting.\n\n**No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in benign nature)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores seem reasonable and consistent across reports. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The highest scores are `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- Since the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and does not perform any suspicious actions, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are justified as they are.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Consideration**\n\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, no external communication, no suspicious behavior.\n- The import is from a local, presumably trusted, module.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMalware score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- No claims are made beyond the obvious; all reports acknowledge the benign, standard nature of the code.\n- The assumption that importing a version string from an internal module is safe is correct.\n\n**No unwarranted assumptions detected.**\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- All reports are consistent: they recognize the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version assignment pattern.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Estimation:**\n\nBased on all the above, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- The code is straightforward and standard.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n- **Code security:** Safe, standard version assignment.\n- **Reports:** Accurate, consistent, and justified.\n- **Scores:** Correctly assigned; no changes necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is benign, and the security risk is minimal to none.",
