  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\nFirst, all reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward import of a version string from a local module (`pytestqt._version`) and assignment to `__version__`. They note that this is a standard pattern in Python packaging, generated by tools like setuptools_scm, with no suspicious behavior, external data handling, or malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n- The import statement `from pytestqt._version import version` is a typical pattern for version management.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code does not handle user input, output, or perform any operations beyond assignment.\n- The module `_version` is internal and likely auto-generated, as is common with setuptools_scm.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- None are evident. The code is minimal, clear, and standard.\n- No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation, are present.\n- The reasoning in the reports is sound and consistent.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- The reasoning for these scores is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Risks and Malware:**\n- The reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent.\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version assignment pattern.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores reflect this assessment accurately.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:**\nThis review confirms that the code is a typical, safe version management snippet with no security concerns.",
