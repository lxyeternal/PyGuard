{
  "purpose": "This code provides testing utilities for Qt signals, including signal blockers, signal spies, and callback blockers, primarily used in pytest-based testing of Qt applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input from signals (connect, disconnect, signal emission), callback functions, and configuration parameters such as timeouts and signal lists.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include disconnecting signals, emitting signals, handling callback arguments, and raising exceptions upon timeout or signal emission issues.",
  "flows": "Signals are connected to internal handlers (e.g., _quit_loop_by_signal), which update internal state and potentially trigger exceptions; callbacks are invoked, and signal emissions are monitored and recorded. Signal data flows from signal emission to connected slots, which update internal states and may raise exceptions based on test conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code employs standard PyQt/PySide mechanisms, uses functools.partial, and handles signals robustly. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are detected. The code mainly manages signal connections, disconnections, and timeout handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-structured, standard testing utilities for Qt signals and callbacks. It manages signal connections, disconnections, waiting with timeouts, and error handling for signal emission and callback invocation. The functions and classes follow expected patterns for signal handling in PyQt/PySide. No code indicates malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system modifications. The presence of exception handling and signal monitoring aligns with testing utilities, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate testing utility module for Qt signal management in pytest. It does not contain any malicious code or behavior. It is designed to facilitate signal and callback testing and includes robust error handling for expected and unexpected signal behavior.",
