  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, considering the code's functionality, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code is for signal testing in Qt, using signal emissions, signal tuples, and function arguments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Focuses on signal emission, exception raising, and signal parameter storage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The code is standard for testing Qt signals.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, legitimate testing code with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, given the code's testing nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes testing utilities for signals, signal blockers, and spies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Monitors signal emissions, disconnections, and exception handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, standard signal handling, and no external communication.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate testing code, very high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility classes for signal handling, waiting, and assertions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signal connection, emission, waiting, and exception raising.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, standard Qt signal handling, no external access.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid testing utility, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — minimal, due to testing scope.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing utilities for signals, including blocking and verification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signal connection/disconnection, emission, and verification.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, standard patterns, no external access.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, safe testing code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — consistent with testing utilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Signal and callback testing utilities, signal connection/disconnection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Signal emission, callback invocation, exception raising.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or external communication. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate testing code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — acceptable for testing utilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is transparent and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1), justified by the fact that this code could be misused if integrated maliciously, but as-is, it is safe.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, given the code's testing utility scope.\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scoring aligns well with the code's functionality. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk beyond the inherent potential misuse in a malicious context.",
