{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for testing Qt signals and callbacks, including mechanisms for waiting for signals, verifying emissions, handling timeouts, and disconnecting signals safely. It is designed for use in testing Qt applications to ensure signals are emitted as expected.",
  "sources": "Signal connections via connect() methods, signal emission triggers, callback invocations, and environment variables are not directly used; the code relies on Qt's signal-slot mechanism and internal state tracking.",
  "sinks": "Signal emissions stored in internal lists, exceptions raised on timeouts or unexpected emissions, and signal disconnections via _silent_disconnect.",
  "flows": "Signals are connected to internal slots; upon emission, internal state is updated; if conditions are met, the event loop is quit; exceptions are raised if timeouts occur or signals are not emitted as expected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The code uses standard Qt and pytest mechanisms. No external network or file system access is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of testing utilities for Qt signals, with clear structure and purpose. It manages signal connections, waits for signals with timeouts, verifies signal parameters, and disconnects signals safely. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on signal emission tracking and validation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's intent and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of testing utilities for Qt signal handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score reflects its utility scope and safety. Overall, it is safe for supply chain use in testing environments.",
