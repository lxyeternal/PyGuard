{
  "purpose": "This module provides an abstraction layer for importing and interfacing with different Qt Python bindings (PyQt5/6 and PySide2/6) to ensure compatibility across various environments when used with pytest-qt.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PYTEST_QT_API), system modules (sys.modules), and dynamically imports Qt-related modules based on configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses dynamic import functions (__import__), calls functions on imported modules (e.g., QtCore.QMessageLogger), and accesses attributes that depend on runtime module state. These are typical for normal module loading, not directly malicious.",
  "flows": "Source: Environment variables and system modules → Dynamic imports and attribute access → Function calls and property access based on imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard dynamic imports, environment variable checks, and version validation. No obfuscated code, no unexpected network connections, or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads Qt bindings based on environment variables, system state, and import success, which is typical for cross-platform compatibility. It performs environment checks and raises exceptions if unsupported or incompatible versions are detected. All dynamic operations are standard for plugin-like modules. There is no evidence of malicious code or sabotage. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. It adheres to safe practices for runtime imports and version checks.",
  "conclusion": "The module appears to be a legitimate, well-structured compatibility layer for Qt bindings in pytest-qt. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard dynamic import techniques, environment variable handling, and version validation. Overall, the code is safe and intended solely for facilitating Qt API compatibility.",
