{
  "purpose": "Provides a compatibility layer for importing Qt classes across different Qt bindings (PyQt5/6, PySide2/6), abstracting API differences.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PYTEST_QT_API), sys.modules, dynamic __import__ calls, module attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic imports and attribute access that could be influenced by environment variables or module states.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or sys.modules check → dynamic __import__ → attribute access on imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to determine import paths; reliance on dynamic import patterns, but no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility checks, dynamic imports, and version validation for Qt bindings. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Use of environment variables could be manipulated but is typical for such configuration modules. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer for Qt bindings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is reliance on environment variables, which is common in such modules but does not indicate malicious activity.",
