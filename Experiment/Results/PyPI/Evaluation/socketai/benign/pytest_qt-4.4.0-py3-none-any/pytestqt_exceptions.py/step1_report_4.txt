{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for capturing and handling exceptions in Qt event loops during testing, as well as custom exception definitions for test-related errors.",
  "sources": "sys.excepthook, sys.stderr, sys.last_exc, get_marker (from pytestqt.utils), and internal exception lists",
  "sinks": "sys.excepthook (can affect global exception handling), sys.stderr (can output exception info), pytest.fail (raises test failures with exception info)",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught by _except_hook are stored in self.exceptions; capture_exceptions yields this list; fail_if_exceptions_occurred triggers pytest.fail if exceptions are present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious network activity or file manipulation; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond standard function calls",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages exception capturing during Qt event loop testing by overriding sys.excepthook and storing exceptions. It formats and reports exceptions through standard streams and pytest mechanisms. The code defines custom exceptions for test failures and screenshot errors. There is no indication of malicious behavior or covert activities. The code relies on standard Python modules and pytest utilities, with no suspicious patterns or external calls. It appears to be a utility module intended for testing frameworks, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for capturing and reporting exceptions in Qt-based tests. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It operates solely within the test environment to manage exceptions and errors, with no evidence of malware, data leaks, or security risks.",
