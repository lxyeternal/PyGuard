{
  "purpose": "The code provides exception capturing, formatting, and handling utilities for testing Qt applications with pytest, including context management and custom exceptions.",
  "sources": "Input data from exceptions captured via sys.excepthook and test markers; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Formatting functions write exception details to StringIO streams; sys.stderr; potential pytest.fail() invocation with exception messages.",
  "flows": "Exceptions captured via sys.excepthook flow into format_captured_exceptions, which formats and outputs them; exceptions can trigger pytest.fail() through fail_if_exceptions_occurred.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. Exception handling and formatting are standard; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up exception capture during tests, temporarily replacing sys.excepthook with a custom handler that records exceptions. Exceptions are stored in a list, formatted, and can trigger test failures. It includes context management for exception collection and methods to restore original hooks. No external data sources or malicious flows are present; the code functions solely for testing purposes with standard exception handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for capturing and formatting exceptions during Qt application testing in pytest. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate testing support code.",
