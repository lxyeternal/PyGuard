  "purpose": "Provides exception capturing utilities for Qt testing with pytest, managing sys.excepthook, formatting exceptions, and integrating with pytest.fail.",
  "sources": "sys.excepthook, exception list in _QtExceptionCaptureManager, traceback.print_exception, sys.stderr",
  "sinks": "sys.stderr, pytest.fail, formatted exception strings",
  "flows": "Exceptions are captured via sys.excepthook, stored in a list, formatted, and potentially trigger pytest.fail()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard exception handling patterns",
  "analysis": "The code installs a custom sys.excepthook to capture uncaught exceptions during Qt tests, stores exceptions, formats them for display, and can trigger test failures. It properly restores the original hook after use. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; use of standard modules and practices indicates a legitimate utility. The only minor concern is the global override of sys.excepthook, which could interfere with other exception handling in a production environment, but this is typical for testing utilities. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for exception handling in pytest-qt testing scenarios. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The slight security risk associated with overriding sys.excepthook is justified in a controlled testing context and does not indicate malicious intent.",
