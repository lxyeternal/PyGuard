  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for capturing and handling exceptions during Qt event loop execution in pytest tests, including context managers, hooks, and custom exception classes.",
  "sources": "Input sources are mainly function parameters, exception hooks, and test item markers. No external untrusted data sources or input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stderr and uses pytest.fail() for reporting errors. No data is sent over the network or written to external files beyond error reporting.",
  "flows": "Exceptions captured via sys.excepthook are stored in internal lists, formatted for display, and can trigger pytest.fail() for test failure reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed. The code adheres to standard exception handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utilities for exception capturing within a test environment, mainly targeting Qt event loops in pytest. It installs a custom sys.excepthook to log exceptions, formats exception information for output, and provides mechanisms to report errors. The functions and classes are straightforward, use standard Python modules, and do not contain suspicious behavior or malicious code. No external network activity, data theft, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test utility code intended for capturing and reporting exceptions during pytest runs involving Qt. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
