{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, to track package version information.",
  "sources": "The version string assigned to __version__ and version, and the version tuple assigned to __version_tuple__ and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sources are present; no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned static values; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of type checking conditional blocks and static version assignments are typical; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated version module with static version assignments. It includes conditional type checking imports, but no dynamic or external input handling. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be a simple, benign version metadata container.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version module with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages version information for the package.",
