  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module.\n- The code assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional type checking imports.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code structure is standard and typical for such version files.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No errors or flaws are evident. The logic is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\n  These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly set to 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No potential vulnerabilities or security risks are present.\n\n- **Potential issues with the code?**  \n  No. The code is a standard version declaration, auto-generated, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's evident behavior.  \n- The scores reflect the actual risk profile accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a typical, auto-generated version info snippet. It contains no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, and no malicious logic. The static assignment of version strings and tuples is standard practice and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The code is benign and safe. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that this code remains static and unaltered in the repository.",
