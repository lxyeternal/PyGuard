  "purpose": "This code defines version-related metadata for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables, static string data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden logic, or obfuscation detected. Conditional typing imports are standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information for a Python package, with conditional import statements based on TYPE_CHECKING for type hints. The version string is hardcoded as '4.4.0', and version tuple is assigned accordingly. No external inputs, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for auto-generated version files.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version metadata file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
