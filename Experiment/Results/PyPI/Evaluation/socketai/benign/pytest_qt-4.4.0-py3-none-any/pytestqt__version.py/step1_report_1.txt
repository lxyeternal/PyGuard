  "purpose": "Define version information for a package using setuptools_scm metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, reading type checking flag.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior; code is straightforward version info assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, with a conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING for type annotations. It assigns static version data ('4.4.0') to variables and defines types accordingly. There are no external inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated version module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical auto-generated version information snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package version variables.",
