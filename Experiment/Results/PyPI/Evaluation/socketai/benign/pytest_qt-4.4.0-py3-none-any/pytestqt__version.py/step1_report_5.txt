  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for package management and version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns static version information within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; all variables are assigned static values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code includes only standard version assignment logic with conditional type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version definition script, likely auto-generated by setuptools_scm. It defines version-related variables and ensures compatibility with type checking. No external data sources, inputs, or suspicious operations are present. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard for package versioning, and does not contain any malicious intent or security risks.",
