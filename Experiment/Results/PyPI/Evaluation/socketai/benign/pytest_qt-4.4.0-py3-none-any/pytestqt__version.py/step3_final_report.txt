  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, auto-generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic behavior or external inputs.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and version tuple; conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, no external data flow, no output effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated version info code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version module assigning static version strings and tuples, with conditional type checking imports. It contains no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no secrets or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, standard behavior. No malicious or security-compromising logic is present. The code's structure and content are typical for such version files, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. It poses no security risk and is safe for use. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, and confidence is high.",
