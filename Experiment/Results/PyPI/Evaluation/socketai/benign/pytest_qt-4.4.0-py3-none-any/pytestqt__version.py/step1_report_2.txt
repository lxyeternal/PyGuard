  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version tracking and type hinting.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to potential data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to multiple variables, no flow of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for version definition.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a typical pattern for handling version information with conditional type checking. It assigns static version data and sets up type hints. No external input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated version declaration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
