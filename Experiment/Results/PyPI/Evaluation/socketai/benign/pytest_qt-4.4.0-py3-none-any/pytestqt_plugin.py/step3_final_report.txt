  "purpose": "Provides pytest fixtures and hooks for managing Qt application testing, including QApplication lifecycle, exception capture, and logging.",
  "sources": "Configuration options, internal API calls, and fixture setup within pytest environment.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data leaks or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Internal flow of configuration and fixture management; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest plugin setup for Qt testing, managing QApplication instances, exception handling, and logging. It uses typical pytest fixtures, hooks, and configuration options. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and there are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, readable, and follows best practices for test infrastructure. The security implications are minimal, with no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard pytest setup for Qt application testing with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
