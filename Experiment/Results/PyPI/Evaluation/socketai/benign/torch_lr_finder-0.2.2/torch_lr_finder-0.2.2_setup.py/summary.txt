  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with conditional external dependency installation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is reliance on external repositories, which is a common practice but warrants trust in the source. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
