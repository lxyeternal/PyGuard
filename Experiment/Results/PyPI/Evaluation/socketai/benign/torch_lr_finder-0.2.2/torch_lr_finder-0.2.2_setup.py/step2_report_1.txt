  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, scoring, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script installs 'apex' conditionally via subprocess, based on command-line args and torch version. It reads README.md and sets up package metadata.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The subprocess calls execute pip commands to install external dependencies, which could be risky if the repository is compromised, but this is a common practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the potential risk in external dependency installation but notes the code is standard and low risk overall.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The only concern is reliance on external repositories, but no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the dynamic installation of 'apex' from GitHub.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. The subprocess calls are standard for such setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly notes the security concern about remote code execution during dependency installation but considers the code legitimate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and accurate. No issues with the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—conditional 'apex' installation via subprocess, reading README.md, setting up package.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or obfuscation; subprocess calls are typical but could be exploited if the source repository is compromised.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly states the code is standard with a typical security concern.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script, with optional apex installation based on command-line args.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report accurately describes the code as legitimate with a typical dependency installation risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on apex installation, reading README.md, and setup configuration.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. The subprocess calls are straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard and low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with conditional external dependency installation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are set to 0, which is justified; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated (0.2) due to reliance on external repositories for apex, which could be compromised, but this is common practice and not malicious in itself.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** All reports are consistent, accurate, and cautious about external dependency risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting dependency on external repositories but not indicating malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe overall assessment aligns with the reports' conclusions: the code is standard, with a minor security concern regarding external dependency installation, but no evidence of malicious activity.",
