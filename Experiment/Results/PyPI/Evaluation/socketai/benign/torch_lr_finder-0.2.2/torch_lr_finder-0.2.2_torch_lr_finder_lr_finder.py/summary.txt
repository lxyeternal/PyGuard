  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate utility suite for PyTorch training and hyperparameter tuning. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or covert operations. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is justified by the filesystem operations involved in checkpointing, which are typical in such utilities."
