      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with conditional external dependency installation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is reliance on external repositories, which is a common practice but warrants trust in the source. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import of classes from a reputable open-source library used in machine learning workflows. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are accurate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate utility suite for PyTorch training and hyperparameter tuning. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or covert operations. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is justified by the filesystem operations involved in checkpointing, which are typical in such utilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured testing suite for a PyTorch learning rate finder. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements. The security risk is negligible, and malware scores are 0. The overall risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by its testing nature but no actual security threat."
