  "purpose": "This code defines an import interface for the aws_profile_manager module, exposing specific classes for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from aws_profile_manager.common.common, aws_profile_manager.profile_switch.switch, aws_profile_manager.profile_add.add, aws_profile_manager.profile_edit.edit, aws_profile_manager.rotate_keys.rotate",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data outputs or network operations are present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing logic present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with explicit imports and a clear export list; no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from submodules within aws_profile_manager and defines __all__ for export. It does not include any logic, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, backdoors, or malicious code injection are evident. It is a typical module setup file with clean, explicit imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization script that exposes specific classes for external use. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on this snippet.",
