{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that manages AWS profiles, providing imports for common functionalities, switching profiles, adding profiles, editing profiles, and rotating keys.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports specific classes from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data transmission present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present; this is purely import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from various internal modules related to AWS profile management and declares these for public export. There is no data manipulation, no input/output operations, no dynamic execution, nor any suspicious or malicious logic present. The structure and content are typical for a Python module interface file.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving as an interface to other modules in a profile management system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
