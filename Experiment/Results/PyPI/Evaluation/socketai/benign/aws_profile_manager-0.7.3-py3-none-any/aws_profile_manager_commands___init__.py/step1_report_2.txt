{
  "purpose": "The code defines exports for a Python package related to AWS profile management, including common functionalities, profile switching, adding, editing, and rotating keys.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from various modules within the aws_profile_manager package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports modules and defines __all__, no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely imports modules and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports classes from different submodules of aws_profile_manager and declares them in __all__ for export. There is no execution, data handling, or dynamic behavior that could pose security risks. The structure suggests a typical module __init__.py file or a package export list, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes classes related to AWS profile management.",
