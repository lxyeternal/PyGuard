{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for an AWS profile management package, organizing and exposing specific classes from different modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various submodules within the aws_profile_manager package",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no output or data handling occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; this is purely an import and export declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present in this code snippet",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from internal modules and defines the __all__ attribute for exports. It does not execute any logic, handle input/output, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected. Since this is a standard module export pattern, it is unlikely to contain malicious intent. The code is straightforward and maintains good coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely responsible for exposing certain classes for external use. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
