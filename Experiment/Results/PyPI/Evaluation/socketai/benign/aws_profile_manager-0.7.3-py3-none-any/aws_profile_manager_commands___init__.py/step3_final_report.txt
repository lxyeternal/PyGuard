  "purpose": "Module initialization file for aws_profile_manager, exposing specific classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal submodules: common, switch, add, edit, rotate.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only imports and defines __all__, with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export module with no suspicious constructs or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as a module interface. No data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify these scores. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident. The code is a standard pattern for Python package __init__.py files, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup file with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or revision is necessary.",
