  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to switch the default AWS profile in the user's credentials file.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via command-line options, reads profiles from the user's AWS credentials file, and retrieves the user's home directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes to the AWS credentials file, outputs logs, and may prompt the user for input.",
  "flows": "User provides optional profile name -> code verifies profile existence -> may create backups and prompt user input -> rewrites credentials file -> logs outcome.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and custom modules without revealing sensitive data. No suspicious network activity or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'click' for CLI interaction, reads and modifies AWS profile configurations, and involves user interaction for profile switching. No data leakage, malicious network calls, or malicious code appears. The custom modules 'aws_profile_manager' are external but their usage is for profile management. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of logging and user prompts is typical for CLI tools. The logic is straightforward, managing profile configurations without handling sensitive data insecurely or executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS profile switcher CLI tool without malicious intent. It manipulates configuration files as expected and does not perform any suspicious actions. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
