  "purpose": "Manage AWS profiles by switching the default profile through user input and external classes.",
  "sources": "Reads user input for profile name, retrieves profiles from local AWS credentials files via external classes.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated profiles to credentials file, logs information and errors.",
  "flows": "User input -> profile validation -> profile selection -> profile list update -> credentials file rewrite.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, external modules used but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for switching AWS profiles, relying on external modules for file operations. It performs local file reads/writes and user prompts without any malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity. The external modules' trustworthiness is a consideration, but no malicious behavior is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to file manipulation and dependency trust. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign AWS profile management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The moderate security risk stems from external dependencies, but the code itself is safe. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain as is unless external modules are compromised.",
