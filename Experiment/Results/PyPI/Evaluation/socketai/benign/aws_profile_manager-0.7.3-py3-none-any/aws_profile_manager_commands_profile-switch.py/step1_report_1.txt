  "purpose": "This script manages AWS profile switching by modifying the ~/.aws/credentials file based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input via --aws-profile-name option, and methods from aws_profile_manager (Common and Switch classes).",
  "sinks": "rewrite_credentials_file method which writes profile data to credentials file, and logging functions that output information.",
  "flows": "Input aws_profile_name flows into conditional logic for profile selection, then data flows into rewrite_credentials_file which updates credentials file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious network activity; logic appears consistent with profile management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI utility for switching AWS profiles. It gathers profiles, creates backups, prompts the user for input if necessary, and rewrites the credentials file. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of logging for warnings and errors is standard. External classes (Common, Switch) are presumed to handle file and profile operations; no malicious behavior is evident from their usage here. No untrusted data is used in dangerous operations, and no insecure coding patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs profile switching for AWS credentials without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It solely manipulates local files and logs information. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
