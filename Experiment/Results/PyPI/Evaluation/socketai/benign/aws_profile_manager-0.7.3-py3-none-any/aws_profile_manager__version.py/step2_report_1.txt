  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code only assigns a static version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n- They appropriately note the absence of obfuscation, data flows, or anomalies.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified because the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and standard practice.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- Given the code's simplicity, the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:  \n- The code snippet is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.  \n- All reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code snippet is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports correctly reflect this, and the scores are appropriate.",
