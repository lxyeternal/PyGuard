  "purpose": "This code snippet declares a static version string for a Python package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. It is a standard practice for package metadata. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, with consistent scoring of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or external components support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
