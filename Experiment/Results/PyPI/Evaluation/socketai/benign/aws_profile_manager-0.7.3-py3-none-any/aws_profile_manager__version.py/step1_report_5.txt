  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version variable assignment with no additional logic, input handling, or external data interactions. This is typical in Python modules to indicate versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. No external dependencies or data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version string declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a benign component of a larger project.",
