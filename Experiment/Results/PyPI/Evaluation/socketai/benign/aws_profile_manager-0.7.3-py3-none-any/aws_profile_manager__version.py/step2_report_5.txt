  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity or security risks, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or suspicious behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a simple version string assignment.\n   - No false positives or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign version declaration.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, given the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|----------------|------------------|------------|--------------|\n| 0              | 0                | 0          | No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no security risk. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate and accurate. No changes are necessary.",
