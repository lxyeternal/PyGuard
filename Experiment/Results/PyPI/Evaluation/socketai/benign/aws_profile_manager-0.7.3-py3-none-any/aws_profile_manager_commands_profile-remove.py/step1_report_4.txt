  "purpose": "This script removes an AWS profile from the user's credentials file, with user confirmation.",
  "sources": "User input via input() for confirmation and command-line options for profile name and confirmation flags.",
  "sinks": "Deletion of profile data from the 'all_profiles' dictionary, which is then rewritten to the credentials file.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line options or user prompts flows into deletion of the profile entry, which then updates the credentials file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious code behavior; the code primarily performs file manipulation based on user input.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input for profile selection and confirmation, manipulates a local dictionary of profiles, and rewrites the credentials file. The use of input() for confirmation is standard. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident. The code interacts with the filesystem via the rewrite function, but this is part of its intended functionality. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing AWS profiles with no malicious intent. It securely prompts the user and modifies local credential files as expected. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is observed.",
