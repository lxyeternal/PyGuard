  "purpose": "Module initialization and re-export of classes related to AWS profile management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from aws_profile_manager.common.common, aws_profile_manager.profile_switch.switch, aws_profile_manager.profile_add.add, aws_profile_manager.profile_edit.edit, aws_profile_manager.rotate_keys.rotate",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input used or processed",
  "flows": "Import statements establish module dependencies; no data flow from sources to sinks as no runtime data processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export setup, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as a module export interface. There are no dynamic code, external data flows, or suspicious patterns. The code is static, clear, and standard for Python package modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0. The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and intent.",
