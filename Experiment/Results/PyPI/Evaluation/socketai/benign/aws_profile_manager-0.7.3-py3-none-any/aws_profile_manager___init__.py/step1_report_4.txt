{
  "purpose": "The code defines the public interface for the aws_profile_manager package by exporting specific classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from multiple modules within the aws_profile_manager package: common.common, profile_switch.switch, profile_add.add, profile_edit.edit, rotate_keys.rotate.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and an __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or side effects observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes from internal modules and sets the __all__ attribute to specify exported symbols. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or external interactions. All elements appear to be standard Python module structuring. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data leaks, or harmful code snippets. The code is straightforward and intended for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module interface declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves to define which classes are publicly available for import from the package.",
