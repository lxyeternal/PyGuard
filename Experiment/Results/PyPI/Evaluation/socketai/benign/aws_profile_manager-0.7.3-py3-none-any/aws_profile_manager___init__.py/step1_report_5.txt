  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from different submodules within the aws_profile_manager package, likely to expose them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from aws_profile_manager.common.common, aws_profile_manager.profile_switch.switch, aws_profile_manager.profile_add.add, aws_profile_manager.profile_edit.edit, and aws_profile_manager.rotate_keys.rotate.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observed in this code snippet; it is primarily import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains import statements and an __all__ declaration. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a structured package and declares an export list via __all__. No data is being processed or transmitted. The structure suggests standard module setup. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining accessible classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for exposing classes from a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues. It appears to be legitimate application code with no security concerns.",
