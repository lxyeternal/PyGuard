  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a package related to AWS profile management, including common functions, profile switching, adding, editing, and key rotation.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from 'aws_profile_manager' sub-packages",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output operations; mainly module imports and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; standard import and export syntax",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a structured package and an export list (__all__). There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The structure is straightforward, typical for Python module exports, and contains no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves to organize and expose specific components of the package.",
