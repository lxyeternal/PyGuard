  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is only import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification for scores:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above; purely import/export.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard module interface setup.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar import/export pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward import statements.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, external data flow, or security concerns, the overall risk score should be **very low**, close to 0.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code snippets are purely structural, setting up module exports.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just in case, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
