  "purpose": "The code imports modules and defines an export list for the aws_profile_manager package, likely facilitating profile management functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from aws_profile_manager.common, aws_profile_manager.profile_switch, aws_profile_manager.profile_add, aws_profile_manager.profile_edit, and aws_profile_manager.rotate_keys modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which are standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and export list setup for the aws_profile_manager package. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for Python module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a module initializer with standard import and export declarations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
