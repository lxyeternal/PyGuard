      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The primary security flaw is the unsafe dynamic execution of plugin code via eval() without validation, leading to a high potential for malicious activity. The scores in the reports are appropriate, but the malware score in Report 2 should be increased to reflect the high risk. Overall, this code is insecure in untrusted environments and should be refactored to use safer mechanisms such as importing modules securely, sandboxing, or code signing."

The moderate security risk stems from external dependencies, but the code itself is safe. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain as is unless external modules are compromised."
