  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the current default AWS profile from user's ~/.aws/credentials.",
  "sources": "common.get_all_profiles(), common.get_users_home()",
  "sinks": "logging.warning()",
  "flows": "common.get_all_profiles() and common.get_users_home() provide profile data to switch.get_defaults_backup(), which is then logged.",
  "anomalies": "Logging potentially sensitive profile info; reliance on external classes with unknown internal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and an external module, then creates instances of Common and Switch. It retrieves all profiles and user home directory, then calls get_defaults_backup() with profile data, logging the result. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is logging profile info, which could expose sensitive data if logs are accessible. External classes' behavior is unknown, but no malicious activity is evident. The code is straightforward and benign, with no network activity or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for displaying AWS profile info. The primary security consideration is the potential exposure of sensitive data via logs. No malicious intent or malware is detected. The risk score should be low, around 0.2, reflecting the minimal threat but acknowledging possible data leakage through logging.",
