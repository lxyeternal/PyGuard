{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to prompt the user for AWS profile credentials and session tokens.",
  "sources": "Input functions that read user-entered data from standard input via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code only collects user input and returns it, with no processing or transmission.",
  "flows": "User inputs are collected through input() calls and returned as strings; no data flows to external systems within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly prompts for sensitive credentials and session tokens without any encryption or validation, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions are straightforward prompts for user input of AWS credentials and session tokens. There are no data leaks, external communications, or suspicious code patterns. The code simply collects and returns user-entered data, which is typical for credential collection interfaces. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple credential collection interface with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior; it is likely part of a larger credential setup process.",
