{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to prompt the user for AWS credential details and a profile name.",
  "sources": "User input via input() prompts for profile name, AWS access key ID, secret access key, and session token.",
  "sinks": "Input values are stored in local variables and returned; no direct data leak or external transfer occurs within this code segment.",
  "flows": "User inputs (sources) are captured and returned without further processing or external transmission; no flow to external systems or insecure handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code straightforwardly prompts for sensitive credentials without additional security measures (e.g., masking input), but this alone isn't suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains simple input prompts for AWS credentials and profile name. It does not perform any external communication, file operations, or insecure handling of data beyond collecting user input. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The lack of masking input for credentials is a minor security concern but not malicious. Overall, the functions appear to serve as credential collection prompts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a user interface for inputting AWS credentials. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this fragment.",
