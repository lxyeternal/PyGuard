  "purpose": "The code defines a class 'Add' with methods to prompt the user for AWS credentials and profile information via input(), returning the collected data.",
  "sources": "Input prompts for profile name, AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, and AWS Session Token.",
  "sinks": "Returned credential data; no data transmission or storage shown.",
  "flows": "User inputs collected via input() are returned directly; no further data flow or external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward credential prompts with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple credential collection interface with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. It collects sensitive data via input() without masking, which is a security concern but not malicious. The malware score is justified as 0, as there is no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or network activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clear code. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the sensitive nature of credential collection but no active threat. The code's logic is benign, and the scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign credential prompt class with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure collection of credentials, but this does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
