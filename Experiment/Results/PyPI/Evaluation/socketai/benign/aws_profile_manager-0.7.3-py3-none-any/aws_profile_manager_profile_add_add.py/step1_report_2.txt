{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple interface for collecting AWS credentials and profile information from a user via input prompts.",
  "sources": "Input prompts asking for profile name, AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, and AWS Session Token.",
  "sinks": "Input functions which could potentially receive untrusted data; no direct data leaks or network transmission in the code itself.",
  "flows": "User inputs are collected via input() and returned; no further processing or transmission shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly prompts for AWS credentials, including secret keys, and stores them in variables without validation or encryption. No hardcoded secrets are present, but collecting credentials via input is sensitive. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of straightforward input prompts for AWS credentials and profile name, with no additional logic or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation. The practice of collecting sensitive credentials via input prompts is a security concern but not malicious in itself. Overall, the code is simple and benign, focused solely on user input collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in intent, serving as a credential collection interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. However, the direct collection of sensitive credentials warrants caution from a security perspective, but this alone does not constitute malicious activity.",
