  "purpose": "This code imports a class or function named 'Add' from a relative module and makes it available for external use via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the relative module '.add'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module 'add' to the current module's namespace, then is exposed via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module pattern for importing and exporting specific components. It imports 'Add' from a relative module and explicitly declares it for external access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code structure is simple and adheres to common Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module with no malicious intent or security issues. It functions as a basic import/export setup with no suspicious elements.",
