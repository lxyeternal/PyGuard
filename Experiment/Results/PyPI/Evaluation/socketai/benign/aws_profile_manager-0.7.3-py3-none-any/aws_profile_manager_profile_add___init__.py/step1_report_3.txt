{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to be setting up an import for a class or function named 'Add' from a local submodule and exposing it as part of the module's public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module structure and attempts to import 'Add' from a local 'add' submodule.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; there are no external data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted sources; the code only performs an internal import and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class or function from a local submodule named 'add' and declares '__all__' for module exports. It is a typical pattern for Python modules to control what gets exposed publicly. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code does not interact with external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
