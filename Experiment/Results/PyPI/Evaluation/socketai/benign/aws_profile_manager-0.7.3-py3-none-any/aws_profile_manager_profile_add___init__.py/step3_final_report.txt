{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'Add' class from a local module '.add' and exposes it via the '__all__' list for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module pattern that imports a class and exposes it. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
