  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .add import Add\n\n__all__ = ('Add',)\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present**\n\n- The code is a straightforward import and export pattern in Python. It imports `Add` from a local module `.add` and exposes it via `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each report's reasoning and scores**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple import/export pattern with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is benign, standard import/export.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; standard pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, standard import/export, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final assessment and recommendations\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified.\n- The code is a minimal, benign module setup with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is standard and safe. All scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
