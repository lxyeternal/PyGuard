  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs",
  "flows": "Import statement flows into __all__ assignment, exposing Add",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal; simple import and export statement, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Add from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for module export. It is a typical module setup with no signs of obfuscated code, malicious activity, or security issues. There are no external data reads, sinks, or suspicious flows present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exposes a class.",
