  "purpose": "This script adds a new AWS profile to the user's credentials file, prompting for missing information and validating input formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from command-line options, user prompts via add.ask_* methods, and data from common methods such as get_users_home and get_all_profiles.",
  "sinks": "Methods that rewrite the credentials file, such as common.rewrite_credentials_file, and logging errors or terminating execution.",
  "flows": "Input data from CLI options and user prompts flows through validation functions and into the profile dictionary, then into the rewrite_credentials_file method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. Input validation appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious data flows. No external network or suspicious file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely prompts and validates AWS credential inputs, avoiding storing or transmitting secrets insecurely within the code. It performs validation checks on input formats and handles existing profiles properly. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors is evident. The only sensitive data handled is user-provided credentials, which are validated locally and stored in standard AWS credentials files. No external network activity or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing AWS profiles, with proper validation and no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily limited to the handling of AWS credentials which is appropriate for this context.",
