  "purpose": "This script adds a new AWS profile to the user's credentials file with validation for input data.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line options (--aws-profile-name, --aws-access-key-id, --aws-secret-access-key, --aws-session-token) and methods retrieving existing profiles and validating credentials from aws_profile_manager.Common.",
  "sinks": "Writing updated profile data to the credentials file via common.rewrite_credentials_file. Logging error messages and calling exit() on validation failures.",
  "flows": "User inputs (sources) are validated through common methods; upon success, data is stored in all_profiles and eventually written to the credentials file. Error conditions trigger logs and process termination.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials found. No use of unsafe code or obfuscated logic. The code's logic appears standard for credential handling. No suspicious network activity or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, profile management, and file rewriting with no signs of malicious behavior. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden actions. It relies on external methods (Common and Add) presumed to handle validation securely. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical credential management script with validation and user interaction. No malicious behavior or malware detected. It appears to be a legitimate utility for AWS profile configuration.",
