{
  "purpose": "This script adds a new AWS profile to the user's credentials file, prompting for necessary details and validating input.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line options and interactive prompts for profile name, AWS access key ID, secret access key, and session token.",
  "sinks": "Data written to the AWS credentials file through 'common.rewrite_credentials_file' which updates the profile information.",
  "flows": "User inputs (sources) flow into validation checks, then into data structures, and finally into the credentials file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Validation functions for AWS keys are used, but their implementation details are unknown. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers user input or command-line parameters for AWS credentials, validates them via 'common' methods, and writes the new profile data into the credentials file. Validation appears to focus on correct formatting of AWS keys. The process involves standard user input handling, validation, and file writing. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic beyond normal credential handling. The only potential concern is reliance on external 'common' methods for validation, but without their code, no malicious behavior can be inferred from their use here.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for managing AWS profiles with no indications of malicious intent or malware. It performs standard validation and credential management functions without suspicious activity.",
