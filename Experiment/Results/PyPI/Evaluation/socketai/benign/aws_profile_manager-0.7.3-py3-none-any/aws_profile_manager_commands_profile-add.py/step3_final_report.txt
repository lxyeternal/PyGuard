  "purpose": "Adds a new AWS profile to the user's credentials file, validating input and updating stored profiles.",
  "sources": "Command-line options, user prompts via 'add' module, validation functions in 'common' module.",
  "sinks": "Credentials file write operation via 'common.rewrite_credentials_file'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation functions -> profile data update -> file rewrite.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity. External 'add' module's security depends on its implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard credential management: it validates AWS keys, prompts for missing data, and updates the credentials file. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Validation functions are used appropriately, and user input handling is typical for CLI tools. The external 'add' module's methods are assumed safe; if malicious, they could pose a risk, but no evidence suggests this. The logic for validation appears correct, with no signs of backdoors or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting typical handling of sensitive credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate AWS profile addition utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. External modules should be trusted or reviewed separately. The code is clear, straightforward, and performs expected credential management tasks without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
