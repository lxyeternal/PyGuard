  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiters for the opsworkscm service client in boto3, including documentation links and class definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, botocore.waiter, type_defs), class definition, method definition, docstrings, and module metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; code primarily defines types, classes, and documentation.",
  "flows": "Imports and class definition flow, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of conditional import based on sys.version_info is standard. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module providing type annotations and a custom waiter class for boto3's opsworkscm service. It imports necessary modules, defines a subclass of Waiter, and annotates the wait method with type definitions. The only dynamic behavior is conditional importing based on Python version, which is a common practice. No data handling, external input, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a well-structured, documented, and standard implementation for type annotations and waiters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly providing type annotations and class definitions for boto3 waiters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
