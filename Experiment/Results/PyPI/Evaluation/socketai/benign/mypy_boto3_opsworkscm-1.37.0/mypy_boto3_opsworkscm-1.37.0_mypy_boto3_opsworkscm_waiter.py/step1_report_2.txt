{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiters for the boto3 OpsWorksCM client, specifically for node association status monitoring.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, botocore.waiter.Waiter, and a local type definitions module. Reads the Python version from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code mainly sets up class definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected. Usage of standard library and botocore modules, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party libraries securely. It defines a subclass of Waiter for specific AWS service waiters, with detailed documentation links. No network, file, or environment operations occur that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of type hinting and class extension for AWS waiters. No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured Python module providing type annotations and a custom waiter class for AWS OpsWorksCM service. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
