  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to determine if the issues are valid, if the scores are appropriate, and whether any anomalies or risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, primarily defining a subclass of `Waiter` with a `wait()` method, including type annotations and documentation links.\n- No untrusted data sources, network operations, file I/O, or environment manipulations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution.\n- The use of conditional import based on Python version is standard practice.\n- The purpose appears to be providing type safety and documentation for AWS waiters.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and waiters for `opsworkscm`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for node association status.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no external data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Documentation and type annotations for `NodeAssociated` waiter.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, just class extension and documentation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Type-safe interface for waiting on node association.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow from untrusted sources, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and class extension for `OpsWorksCM` waiter.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Given the evidence, I agree with the assigned scores.**\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities present)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and class extension module for boto3 waiters, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
