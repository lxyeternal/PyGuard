  "purpose": "Type annotations and class extension for boto3 opsworkscm waiters, providing documentation and type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class definition with wait method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external input, or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and method call; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass of Waiter with type annotations, conditional import for compatibility, and documentation links. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code intended for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are accurate and justified.",
