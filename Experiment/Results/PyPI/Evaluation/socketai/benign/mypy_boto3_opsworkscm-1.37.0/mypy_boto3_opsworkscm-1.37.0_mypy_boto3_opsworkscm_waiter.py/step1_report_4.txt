  "purpose": "Type annotations and class extension for boto3 OpsWorksCM client waiters, providing type-safe interfaces for waiting on node association status.",
  "sources": "Import of sys, botocore.waiter.Waiter, and local type definitions; no external user input sources or data input points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines a class with a method that calls a superclass method without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and solely defines a typed subclass for boto3 waiters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version, and defines a subclass of Waiter with a wait method. The wait method overrides the parent method with proper type annotations. There are no indications of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign, well-structured type hinting and interface extension for a boto3 client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented type annotations and class extension module for boto3 waiters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
