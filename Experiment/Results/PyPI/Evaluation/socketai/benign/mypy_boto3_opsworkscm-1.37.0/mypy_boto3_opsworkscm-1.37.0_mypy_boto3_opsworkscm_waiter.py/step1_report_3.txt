  "purpose": "Type annotations and documentation for the OpsWorksCM client waiter, specifically for NodeAssociated waiters.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, imports from botocore.waiter, and type_defs for request typing.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or harm. The code primarily defines a class with a wait method that delegates to the base class.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to the wait() method are unpacked from a defined type, then passed to the superclass wait method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or malicious code. The code appears standard and focused on type annotations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and external dependencies, defines a subclass for a specific waiter, and provides docstrings referencing external documentation. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any sinks that could leak data or perform malicious actions. The purpose is purely to provide type annotations and documentation for a client wrapper, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type-annotated subclass for AWS OpsWorksCM waiter, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for documentation and type safety, with no suspicious behavior.",
