{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definition for OpsWorksCM waiter, facilitating waiting for node association status.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys module, imports from botocore.waiter, and imports a type definition from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines a class with an overridden method that calls the parent class's method; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or unusual behavior are observed. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and type definitions, defines a subclass of Waiter with an overridden wait method that calls the parent implementation, and includes documentation links. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and there are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign type annotation and subclass definition for boto3 waiters, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
