  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report accurately describes the code's purpose—type annotations and waiters for boto3's opsworkscm service. It correctly identifies import statements, class definitions, and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are present.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard. It is benign with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the imports and version-based conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical subclass extension for boto3 waiters, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the focus on type annotations and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, mainly for type safety and documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the import of modules and type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward subclass with proper typing, with no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a class extension for waiters with documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving as a type-safe wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily for type annotations, class extension, and documentation for boto3 waiters related to the opsworkscm service.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All scores are 0, which is appropriate since the code doesn't perform any data handling, network operations, or sensitive actions.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured Python module for type annotations and class extension.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The reported scores are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
