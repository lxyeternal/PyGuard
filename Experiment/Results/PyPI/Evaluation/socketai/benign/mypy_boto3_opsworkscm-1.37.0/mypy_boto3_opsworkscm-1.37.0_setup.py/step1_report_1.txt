{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-opsworkscm package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description; imports 'setuptools' for packaging; uses hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to files, network, or executes untrusted data. No untrusted input handling or external calls beyond standard package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets static metadata and reads a local file for description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code follows standard setup.py patterns; no obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'Path' for file reading, loads a local README.md file, and invokes 'setup()' with static package metadata and configuration. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or input handling is present. The dependencies and URLs point to legitimate repositories. The code structure and content align with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
