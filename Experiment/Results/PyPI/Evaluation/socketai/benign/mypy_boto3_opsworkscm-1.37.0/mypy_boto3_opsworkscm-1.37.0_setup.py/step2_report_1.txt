  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module.\n- The code reads a local README.md file, imports 'setuptools', and calls 'setup()' with static metadata.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1.0), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The only minor point is the URL: \"https://github.com/youtype/mypy_boto3_builder\" — the repository name \"mypy_boto3_builder\" differs from the package name \"mypy-boto3-opsworkscm\". However, this does not indicate malicious intent; it might be a legitimate repository hosting multiple packages or a typo. Since the URL points to a legitimate GitHub domain and repository, it doesn't raise security concerns.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate because the script performs only static configuration without any risky operations.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis and scoring.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe setup script is a typical, safe Python packaging script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The scoring aligns well with the code's nature.",
