  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-opsworkscm package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports Path from pathlib; imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sinks or operations that process external input.",
  "flows": "Reads file content from disk (README.md) and passes static configuration data to setup(), no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It follows standard Python packaging practices with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no sources of untrusted data, no dangerous data flows, and no suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It reads static files and passes configuration data to setuptools without processing untrusted input or executing suspicious code.",
