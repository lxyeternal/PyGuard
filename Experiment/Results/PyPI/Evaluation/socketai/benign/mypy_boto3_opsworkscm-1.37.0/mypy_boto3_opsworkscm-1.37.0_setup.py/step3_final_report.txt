  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-opsworkscm package, defining package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> setup() call with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure, no dynamic code or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script importing 'setuptools', reading a local README.md file, and calling setup() with fixed metadata. No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The URL points to a legitimate GitHub repository, and the package data is static. The script performs no suspicious operations, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with its benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate safe, static configuration.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
