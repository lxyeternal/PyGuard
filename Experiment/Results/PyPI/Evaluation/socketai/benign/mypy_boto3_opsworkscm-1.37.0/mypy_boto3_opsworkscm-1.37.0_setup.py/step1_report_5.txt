  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-opsworkscm package, used to install and configure the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static package metadata such as name, version, author, dependencies, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs; no dangerous output or command execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A – all data appears to be static or file-based, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, reading a static README file and defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input observed. The only file I/O is reading a static README.md. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for Python packaging. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and appears to be a benign, standard implementation.",
