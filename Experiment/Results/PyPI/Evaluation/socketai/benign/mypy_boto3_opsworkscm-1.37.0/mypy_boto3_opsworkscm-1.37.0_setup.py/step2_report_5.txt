  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The report confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None identified.\n- **Scores?** Malware and securityRisk are both 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification for scores?** Since no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are observed, scores are appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Valid and consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The report also finds the script benign.\n- **Errors, flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Both malware and securityRisk are 0, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no dynamic or unsafe code.\n- **Overall:** Correct and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The analysis confirms standard setup script behavior.\n- **Errors?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware and securityRisk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious code, no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The script is standard.\n- **Errors?** None.\n- **Scores?** Both 0, fitting the benign nature.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The script is a typical setup script.\n- **Errors?** None.\n- **Scores?** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, so **0.0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports find no obfuscation, so **0.0** is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Since no issues, **0.0** is justified.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no security concerns.",
