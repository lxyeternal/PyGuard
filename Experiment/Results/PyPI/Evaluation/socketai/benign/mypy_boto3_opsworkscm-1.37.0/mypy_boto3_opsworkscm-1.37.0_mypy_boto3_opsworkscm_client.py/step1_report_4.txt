  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the boto3 OpsWorksCM service, providing typed access to AWS API calls.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, third-party botocore types, and local type definitions; class and method definitions with their docstrings.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations calling AWS services via boto3, especially generate_presigned_url, and methods that handle input parameters via **kwargs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to methods (especially generate_presigned_url and methods accepting **kwargs) flow into AWS API calls; no evident data leakage or malicious data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. No suspicious external network calls, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard type annotation and API interface code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions, method signatures, type annotations, and docstrings referencing AWS SDK operations. It utilizes type hints, overloads, and standard patterns for AWS client wrappers. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The generate_presigned_url method uses parameters but does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. All imported modules are standard or documented local types. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured, and documented type annotation and client interface wrapper for AWS OpsWorksCM service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
