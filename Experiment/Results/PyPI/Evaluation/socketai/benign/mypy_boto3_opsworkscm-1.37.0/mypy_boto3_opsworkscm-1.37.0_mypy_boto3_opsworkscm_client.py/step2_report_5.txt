  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report confirms that the code is a straightforward type annotation and client interface for AWS OpsWorksCM, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It emphasizes the absence of untrusted data handling or external effects.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a benign SDK interface, primarily defining types and method signatures. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it highlights the code as a standard SDK client stub with proper type annotations, no external data processing, or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flow. It is a legitimate SDK interface.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the method signatures, type annotations, and the lack of executable or data processing logic. No malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely an interface definition, with no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The report's scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms that the code is a standard SDK wrapper with type annotations, no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious external activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; the code is purely for type checking and API interfacing.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the code as a well-structured type stub and client wrapper, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The only noteworthy point is the future-dated copyright (2025), which is benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no security risks. The code is a standard SDK interface.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is a standard SDK interface with no executable logic beyond method signatures.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation patterns are present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the above, the risk remains at zero, as there's no evidence of security threats or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a collection of type annotations and method signatures for AWS SDK interactions, with no executable or data-processing logic that could be malicious.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The presence of a future-dated copyright (2025) is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n### **Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface with no security concerns.",
