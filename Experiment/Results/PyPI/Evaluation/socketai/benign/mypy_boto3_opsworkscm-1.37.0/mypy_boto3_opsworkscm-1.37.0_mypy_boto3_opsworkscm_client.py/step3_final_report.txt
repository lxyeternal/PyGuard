  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS OpsWorksCM SDK in boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, kwargs unpacking, type definitions, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network activity, no execution logic.",
  "flows": "Method calls with kwargs unpacked into request types; no data flow indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type stub for the AWS OpsWorksCM client, providing method signatures, type annotations, and documentation references. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All method signatures accept kwargs unpacked from predefined request types, serving solely for type checking and IDE support. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present. The future-dated copyright (2025) is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious. The consistent zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk across all reports confirm the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious behavior or security threats. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate scoring. No modifications are necessary.",
