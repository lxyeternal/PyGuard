  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS OpsWorksCM service using boto3 and mypy stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, local modules (.paginator, .type_defs, .waiter), and method definitions within the OpsWorksCMClient class.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations where untrusted data could potentially be passed in (via kwargs) and used in API calls; however, these are standard boto3 interface methods.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from method parameters (kwargs) into API request formation; no explicit data processing or storage is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code strictly defines a client interface with type hints and documentation, with no hidden code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and method signatures for the AWS OpsWorksCM client, leveraging standard AWS SDK practices. It includes property and method definitions, overloads for paginators, and exception classes. The imports are from standard libraries and boto3, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code does not execute or process any data itself but defines a structured API client interface. No suspicious behaviors, such as network calls, file access, or data manipulation, are embedded within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured type annotation and interface definition for the AWS OpsWorksCM client. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, safe component for integrating with AWS services.",
