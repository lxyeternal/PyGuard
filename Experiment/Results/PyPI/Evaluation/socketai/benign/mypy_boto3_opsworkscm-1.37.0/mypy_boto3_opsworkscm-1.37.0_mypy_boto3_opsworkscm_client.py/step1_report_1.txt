  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS OpsWorksCM service in boto3-stubs for improved type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and local module imports; class and method definitions; constants and overloads.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data handling, external data processing, or network effects directly evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code primarily defines types and interfaces without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and API client definition for AWS OpsWorksCM service, utilizing standard Python practices and boto3 patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or abnormal logic are present. The structure includes type hints, overloads for paginators, and exception classes, all consistent with SDK interface definitions. There are no signs of malicious data handling or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK interface definition for boto3, with no signs of malicious intent or security threats. It solely provides type annotations and method signatures for the AWS OpsWorksCM client, aligned with official SDK practices.",
