{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS service identifiers, status values, and paginator/waiter names using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for various literals; no external or untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is detectable; the code only declares constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior are present. The only dynamic aspect is conditional importing of 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type declaration module that provides Literal type aliases for different AWS services and statuses. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions; it solely provides type definitions. The code is well-structured and follows standard practices without obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purely declarative module used for type hinting with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could compromise system security or leak data.",
