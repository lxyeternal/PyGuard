  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS services, statuses, and resource identifiers to be used as type annotations in Python code.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions of string literals assigned to type aliases; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code only defines types.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code solely establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code includes conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' conditionally for compatibility, then defines multiple type aliases as string literal types for use in type annotations. All definitions are static and only assign predefined string sets to type aliases. No external inputs, data processing, or execution of arbitrary code is present. The presence of copyright notice and documentation link does not affect security. The code appears to be purely for type safety purposes. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS service literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or output any data; it merely provides static type annotations. Therefore, the risk of malware or security issues from this code is negligible.",
