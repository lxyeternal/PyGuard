{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS service literal types and related constants, primarily for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the 'sys' module to determine Python version; it assigns string literals to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows from untrusted sources; the code does not process external input or data outputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward, with version-based imports and literal type definitions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-based import logic for 'Literal', defines a comprehensive set of string literal type aliases representing AWS resource states, types, and names. It mainly serves as a type definition module for static analysis or type checking. The structure is clear, with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no indications of malicious intent. All components are static, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definitions module intended for static typing and documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate type checking for AWS service literals. There are no suspicious signals or anomalies that suggest malware or security threats.",
