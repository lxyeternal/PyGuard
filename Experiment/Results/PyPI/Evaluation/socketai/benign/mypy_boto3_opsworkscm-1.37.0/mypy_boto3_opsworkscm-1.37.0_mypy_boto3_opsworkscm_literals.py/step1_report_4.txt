{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service components, including statuses, resource names, and pagination/waiter identifiers, for type annotations and validation.",
  "sources": "The code imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions; defines numerous Literal type aliases with fixed string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing logic; the code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for type annotation purposes. The only notable aspect is the conditional import based on Python version, which is normal for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares string literal types for AWS resource identifiers, statuses, and other fixed strings used in API interactions. It conditionally imports 'Literal' for Python >=3.12 or from typing_extensions for earlier versions, which is standard practice. There are no inputs, outputs, or processing logic; it solely provides type aliases. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, data manipulation, or code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions used for type safety in AWS SDK related code. It contains no malicious intent, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and no security risks. It is safe for use.",
