{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literals, ensuring type safety and clarity for AWS service identifiers and statuses.",
  "sources": "Literal string definitions assigned to type aliases; import statements for 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines type aliases and does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or runtime data processing occurs as this module only contains type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions using 'Literal' for various AWS service statuses and names. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a standard practice for compatibility. The module appears solely focused on static type annotations, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The copyright notice is benign and unrelated to code security.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a static type annotation module for AWS service literals, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard, safe, and well-structured definitions file.",
