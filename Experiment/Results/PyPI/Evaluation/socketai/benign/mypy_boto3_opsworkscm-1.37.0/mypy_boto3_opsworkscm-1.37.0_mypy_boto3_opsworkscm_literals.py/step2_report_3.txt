  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code content, potential security issues, anomalies, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, statuses, and related identifiers.\n- It uses conditional imports for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data processing occurs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines literals for AWS service identifiers and statuses.\n- **Analysis:** No external sources or data flows. No sinks. No anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for type safety. Malware score: 0.\n- **Score justification:** The code is static, with no malicious behavior or security risk. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining AWS literals.\n- **Analysis:** No external input, no data flow, no anomalies. The conditional import is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward type definitions. Malware score: 0.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious or risky elements. Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Defines AWS resource states and types for static typing.\n- **Analysis:** Static definitions, no external data, no dynamic code. The version check for 'Literal' is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with no security concerns. Malware score: 0.\n- **Score justification:** No signs of malware or obfuscation; score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, with extensive AWS literals.\n- **Analysis:** Pure static definitions, no external data, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent. Malware score: 0.\n- **Score justification:** The code is safe, with no malware indicators.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Defines AWS service literals for type safety.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions. Malware score: 0.\n- **Score justification:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of dynamic behavior, external inputs, or security-sensitive operations, the risk score should be very low, ideally 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a benign, static type declaration module with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nEnsure that the scores remain consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary; the current scores are appropriate.",
