  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential security concerns, or misalignments with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for AWS services, statuses, and related constants.\n- The code includes conditional imports for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No external inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose is solely for static type checking and documentation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - No issues are present. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely static type definitions with no runtime behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all assessments are accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign, well-structured type declaration module.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are present.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis that the code is purely for static type annotations, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are correct in their assessment. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
