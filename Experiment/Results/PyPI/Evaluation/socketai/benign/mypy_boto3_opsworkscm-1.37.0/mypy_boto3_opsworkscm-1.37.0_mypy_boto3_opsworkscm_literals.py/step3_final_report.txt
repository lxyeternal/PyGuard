{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS services, statuses, and related identifiers to facilitate static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static type alias definitions; no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard conditional import for 'Literal', no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias declarations for AWS resource identifiers, statuses, and names, with conditional import for compatibility. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or runtime logic. The structure is straightforward and follows standard practices for type hinting in Python. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type declaration module intended for static analysis and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
