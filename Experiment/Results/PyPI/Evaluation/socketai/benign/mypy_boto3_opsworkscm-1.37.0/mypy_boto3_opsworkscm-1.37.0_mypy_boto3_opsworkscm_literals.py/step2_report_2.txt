  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is purely a static type declaration module defining string literal types for AWS services, statuses, paginator/waiter names, etc.\n- It includes conditional imports for `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- There are no external inputs, data processing, dynamic code execution, or any runtime logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The purpose is to improve type safety and documentation for AWS SDK code.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines string literal types for AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the static nature, no external inputs, and standard practice.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely declarative, no risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining literals for AWS services and statuses.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the static, non-executable nature, and standard import practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, negligible security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar static type definitions, with environment-based import logic.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is static, with no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, safe for use.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, defining literals with conditional import.\n- **Analysis:** Properly recognizes the standard pattern and the static nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar static definitions for AWS literals.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no runtime logic, no external data, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Code content:** Purely static type alias definitions for AWS resource identifiers, statuses, and names.\n- **Behavior:** No dynamic code, no external inputs, no data flow, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly assigned as 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly assigned as 0.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly assigned as 0, since no operational or security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores:** All reports have assigned appropriate scores (0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk).\n- **Justification:** The code is a benign, static type declaration module with no security concerns.\n- **Potential adjustments:** None needed; all assessments are justified and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, safe, and well-structured static type definitions module for AWS service literals. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are appropriate, and the overall analysis aligns with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
