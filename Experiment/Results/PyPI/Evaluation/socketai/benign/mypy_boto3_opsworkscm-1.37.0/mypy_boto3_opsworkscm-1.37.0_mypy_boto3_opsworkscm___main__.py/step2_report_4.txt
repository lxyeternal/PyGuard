  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It reads from `sys.argv` and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n- No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no credentials, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The logic is simple, deterministic, and solely informational.\n\n**Assessment of the Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They consistently note the absence of obfuscation, external calls, or data leaks.\n- The confidence level is high (1.0), and the analysis is thorough.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correctly indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since the code does not perform any harmful actions or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The code is very simple, and there are no hidden behaviors or vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n- The code is purely informational and does not process untrusted data beyond command-line arguments.\n- No signs of backdoors, credential leaks, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior.",
