  "purpose": "Provides CLI functionality to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; reads from sys.stdout to display information.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output to stdout; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and primarily informational.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a simple CLI with functions to display package info and version. It reads command-line arguments to decide which info to display and outputs to stdout. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation. The code is clean, minimal, and purpose-driven, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI entrypoint to display package information. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscated code.",
