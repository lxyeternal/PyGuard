  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package info and version.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, calls print_info() which writes package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, providing CLI functionality to display package info and version. It reads input from sys.argv and outputs to stdout without processing untrusted data beyond command-line arguments. No external calls, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard entrypoint script with no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a CLI interface to display package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
