  "purpose": "Provides CLI interface to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv, then outputs version info or package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information about the package and its version. It only reads command-line arguments and writes predefined strings to stdout. There are no external data inputs beyond command-line args, no network calls, and no data processing that could lead to leaks or malicious actions. The code structure is simple, clean, and does not include any obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only outputs static package information based on command-line input.",
