  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) triggers output functions that write to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code observed. The code is straightforward and mainly for informational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script contains two functions: print_info() and print_version(), which output package information and version details respectively. The main() function checks for '--version' argument and calls appropriate functions. The code is simple, clean, and performs only informational output. No external network requests, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical CLI utility without malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple CLI interface for printing package info and version number. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this script.",
