  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entry point to provide package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs package info and version)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data to stdout)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. No unusual code or obfuscated patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, implementing simple CLI functions to display package info or version. It reads command-line arguments and writes output to stdout. There are no external network connections, no untrusted data processing, and no suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing only informational output with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
