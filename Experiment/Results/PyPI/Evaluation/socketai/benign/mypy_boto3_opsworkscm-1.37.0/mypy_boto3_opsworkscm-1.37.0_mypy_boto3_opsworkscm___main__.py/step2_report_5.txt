  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It uses static strings, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external dependencies.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code is minimal, clean, and purpose-specific.\n\n2. **Reported Issues**:\n   - All reports unanimously state that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, no malicious behaviors, and no obfuscation.\n   - They confirm the absence of external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.\n   - The purpose is purely informational.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent and justified. There are no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The code is very simple, and the reports are consistent.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is sound.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely informational, the risk scores should remain low.\n   - The reports' confidence levels are all 1.0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No reason to adjust scores or suspect hidden malicious intent.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code and reports, the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all be **0**.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.",
