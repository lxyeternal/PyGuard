  "purpose": "Simple CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`)",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout (`sys.stdout.write`)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leads to outputting version info; otherwise outputs package info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, straightforward code with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line input. It reads from `sys.argv` and writes to `sys.stdout`. There are no external network calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted data. The logic is simple and deterministic, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which are consistent with the code's behavior. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence and reports support this conclusion, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
