  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS OpsWorksCM service interactions, facilitating type safety and clarity in Python SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, conditional typing imports, and type definitions that specify data schemas for requests and responses.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code mainly defines data types without executing external commands or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to type annotations, with no active data processing or external data sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code is purely declarative with standard type definitions. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Python type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No executable logic, no data processing, nor network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. It is a straightforward schema definition module for AWS service data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type definitions for AWS SDK usage. No malicious intent, no malicious behavior, and no security risks detected. It is purely declarative, designed for type safety.",
