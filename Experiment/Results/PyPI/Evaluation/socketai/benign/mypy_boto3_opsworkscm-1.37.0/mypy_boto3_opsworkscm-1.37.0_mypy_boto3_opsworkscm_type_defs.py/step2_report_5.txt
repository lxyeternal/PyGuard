  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as static type definitions for the boto3 AWS SDK, specifically for the opsworkscm service.\n- They highlight the use of conditional imports for compatibility, standard TypedDict class definitions, and no runtime logic.\n- None mention any suspicious code, external data handling, or potential vulnerabilities.\n- All scores assigned are zero for malware and security risk, aligning with the description.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code contains only static type definitions; no runtime or dynamic code is present.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or handling of untrusted data.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent. The code's purpose is purely to provide type annotations.\n\n### Score Reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions.\n- No signs of security threats, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is documentation and static analysis support, not execution.\n\n### Potential Assumptions and Challenges:\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as purely static type annotations.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are justified given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — No security risk or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for AWS SDK's opsworkscm service. It is free from malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
