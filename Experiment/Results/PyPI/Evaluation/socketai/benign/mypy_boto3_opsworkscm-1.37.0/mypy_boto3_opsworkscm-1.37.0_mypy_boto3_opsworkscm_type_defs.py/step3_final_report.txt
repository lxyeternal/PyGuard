  "purpose": "Type annotations for opsworkscm service type definitions.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, no dynamic data handling or external input.",
  "sinks": "None; no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static TypedDict class definitions used for type hinting in the boto3 AWS SDK for the opsworkscm service. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, but contains no executable code, data processing, network calls, or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves as static type annotations for AWS SDK. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are accurate and justified.",
