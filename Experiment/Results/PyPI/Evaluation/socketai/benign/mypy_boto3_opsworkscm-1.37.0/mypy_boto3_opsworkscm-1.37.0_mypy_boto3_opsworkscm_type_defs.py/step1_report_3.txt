{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the opsworkscm service in boto3, providing data structure schemas for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from literals, system info for Python version checks, and annotations for various TypedDict classes defining request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks indicating untrusted data handling, network operations, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as request parameters and system info into structured TypedDict objects, without any dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version-dependent imports and conditional typing extensions; no suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static type definitions and conditional imports to support different Python versions. It does not include any code execution, network communication, or handling of untrusted data streams. The only external references are to documentation and literals, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious payloads. The code is well-structured, standard for type annotations, and contains no suspicious logic or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of type definitions for boto3's opsworkscm service. It appears legitimate, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as type annotations to improve code clarity and static analysis support.",
