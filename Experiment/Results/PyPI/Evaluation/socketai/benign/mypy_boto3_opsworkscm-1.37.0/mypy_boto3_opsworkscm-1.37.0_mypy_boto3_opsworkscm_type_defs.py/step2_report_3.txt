  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as static type definitions for the boto3 opsworkscm service.\n- No runtime logic, data handling, network operations, or external data processing are present.\n- The code uses conditional imports for Python version compatibility, which is standard practice.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are noted.\n- The purpose is solely for static type checking and documentation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears clean, well-structured, and free of errors or malicious content.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The conditional imports for compatibility are appropriate and standard.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - Risk scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No justification needed; all reports agree on zero risk.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities as false positives, given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-formed set of type definitions for AWS SDK usage.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden logic)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:** The code's purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation, which inherently carries no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely declarative. No changes needed.",
