{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the OpsWorks CM service API in Python, used for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, standard library modules, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to outputs; mainly static type annotations and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; code is standard type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of TypedDict class definitions for API request and response structures, with conditional imports for compatibility. No runtime code, data handling, or external network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a static type hinting library for AWS OpsWorks CM service client in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS OpsWorks CM service, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It functions solely as a static type checking aid, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
