  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is purely static type definitions for the boto3 opsworkscm service, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It notes the use of conditional imports for compatibility and confirms no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code matches this description. No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The type definitions are standard and straightforward.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Confirmed as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature, use of constants, and compatibility imports. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with this description. It’s a collection of TypedDicts with conditional imports, serving as type hints.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly identified as 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code being static type definitions, with no runtime code or external data handling. No suspicious constructs or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is indeed a set of static data schemas with no executable logic or external interactions.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Appropriately 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the absence of runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely declarative for type safety.\n\n- **Assessment:** Matches the code’s content.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Correctly 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the code as data schemas with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code aligns with this description.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Appropriately 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree that the code contains no malicious behavior. The code is purely static type annotations with no runtime logic, network calls, or data processing.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected. The code is straightforward, with conditional imports for compatibility, which is standard practice.\n\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent. No secrets, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is justified. The overall security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the code’s nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the provided reports' assessments. The code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code’s content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and serves its purpose as static type annotations for AWS SDK. No changes or concerns are necessary.",
