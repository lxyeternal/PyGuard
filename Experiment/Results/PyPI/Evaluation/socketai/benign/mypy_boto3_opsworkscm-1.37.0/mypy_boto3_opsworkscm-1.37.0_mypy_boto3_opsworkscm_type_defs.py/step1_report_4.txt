{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for the opsworkscm service API in Python, used for static type checking and IDE assistance.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, datetime, and various type definitions; no runtime data input or external data sources; type annotations derived from imported modules and static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data processing; no functions executing untrusted input or writing data to external systems; purely data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code defines data types and structures without any runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code strictly consists of type definitions with no executable logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for an AWS service's SDK, including TypedDict definitions and conditional imports based on Python version. It does not execute any runtime logic or handle input/output operations that could be exploited. All content appears to be static type definitions intended for static analysis and IDE assistance. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or malicious behavior. No external data processing, network communication, or file manipulation occurs within this code. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions for the opsworkscm service, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely facilitates type checking and code clarity, with no runtime or malicious activity embedded.",
