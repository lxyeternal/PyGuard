  "purpose": "Type definitions for the opsworkscm service in boto3, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, and local modules; class attribute definitions; type annotations within classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions. No dynamic code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; purely static type definitions with no runtime data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions for various API request and response formats. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, which is standard. No data processing, user input handling, or dynamic execution occurs. No external network calls, cryptographic operations, or other suspicious activities are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for a boto3 service. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The purpose is documentation and type safety, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
