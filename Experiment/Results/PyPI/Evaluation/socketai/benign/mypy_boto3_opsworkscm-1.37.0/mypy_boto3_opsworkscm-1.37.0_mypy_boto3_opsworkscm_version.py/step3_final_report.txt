  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string.",
  "sources": "No input or external data; static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future year '2025' in comment, which is likely a placeholder or typo but not security-relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string with a copyright comment. No dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious behavior. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which is not security-relevant. All reports are accurate, and scores are appropriate.",
