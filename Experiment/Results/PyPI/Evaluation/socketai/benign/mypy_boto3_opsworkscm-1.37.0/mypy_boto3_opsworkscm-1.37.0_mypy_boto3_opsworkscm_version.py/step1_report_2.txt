  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "The version string assignment is straightforward and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a version string with a hardcoded value. It includes a comment about the source of truth and copyright information. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks. The version string is static and does not interact with any other code or external inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe.",
