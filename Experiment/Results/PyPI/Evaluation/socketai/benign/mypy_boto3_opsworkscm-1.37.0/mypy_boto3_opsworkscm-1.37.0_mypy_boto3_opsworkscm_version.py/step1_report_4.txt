  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package, serving as the source of truth for version information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the __version__ variable with a static string \"1.37.0\".",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input, output, or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without any data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; simple variable assignment and comment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a comment indicating source of truth for versioning and assigns a version string to __version__. No dynamic code, no input/output, no external data handling, and no malicious constructs are present. It is a standard version declaration commonly found in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign component typical of package metadata.",
