  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025) which is unusual but not malicious; no suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single string assignment to __version__ and a copyright comment. The version number appears standard. No input reading, external data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The future copyright year may be a typo or a placeholder but does not pose a security risk. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version identifier with no malicious or security issues.",
