  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`.\n- It includes a copyright comment with a future year (2025).\n- No dynamic code, input/output, network calls, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The version string is static and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming current date is before 2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- They correctly identify that the code is just a static version assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- Obfuscated, malware, and security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n- The reports do not consider the future year (2025) as a potential anomaly. While not malicious, it could be flagged as a typo or placeholder, but this is minor and not security-relevant.\n- The reports do not challenge the assumption that the version assignment is safe, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions. Malware score should remain **0**.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- The code is straightforward, not obfuscated. Obfuscated score remains **0**.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, the overall security risk remains **0**.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- The only anomaly is the future year, which is unlikely to impact security but could be flagged as a typo. However, it does not elevate the risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable; no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\nThis code is a typical version declaration file with no malicious intent or security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not security-relevant.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- The current scores are appropriate.  \n- No further action needed.",
