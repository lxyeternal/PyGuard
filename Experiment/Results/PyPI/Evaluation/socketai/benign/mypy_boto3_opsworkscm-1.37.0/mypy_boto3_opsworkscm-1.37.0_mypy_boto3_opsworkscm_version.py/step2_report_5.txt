  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment. No issues, input handling, or malicious code are present.  \n   **Confirmed:** No issues detected in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which could be a typo or placeholder, but this is not a security concern.  \n   **No significant errors or flaws** are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   **Scores seem reasonable and consistent** across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   None of the reports assign a high risk score; all are zero, which aligns with the benign assessment.  \n   **No justification needed for higher scores**.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.  \n   **No issues here**.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a static version string assignment without malicious intent.  \n   **Claims are justified and cautious**.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\n- The only anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in the comment, which might be a typo or placeholder. While not a security issue, it could be corrected for accuracy.\n- The code is a typical version declaration pattern, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately cautious. The code is benign, and no changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign assessment of the code snippet.",
