  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3's opsworkscm service, serving as static type hints without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Class methods accepting **kwargs for pagination parameters, version-dependent imports, and class inheritance based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, no data leaks, no processing of untrusted data; methods delegate to boto3's paginator functionality.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods pass kwargs directly to boto3's paginator, with no data manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import for 'Unpack' based on Python version; no obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type stub classes for boto3 paginators, with no malicious or suspicious logic. It defines classes inheriting from Paginator, with type annotations for request and response types, and uses conditional imports for compatibility. No external data handling or code execution occurs. The purpose is solely to provide type hints for IDEs and static analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a static type hinting layer for boto3's opsworkscm paginators, with no security risks or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation.",
