{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS OpsWorksCM service client, providing structured and typed access to paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, sys.version_info for Python version checks, and uses class inheritance and method parameters, especially in the paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods are potential data flow points, accepting untrusted keyword arguments that could influence the behavior or data returned, but they only wrap existing boto3 functionality.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements and type definitions to class inheritance, and within the classes, the paginate methods receive and process arguments to generate paginated responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is evident. The code strictly defines type annotations and paginator classes based on boto3 documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines paginator classes with type annotations for boto3's OpsWorksCM client, with version-dependent imports and detailed documentation links. The paginate methods delegate to boto3's native implementation, with no indication of data manipulation or malicious behavior. There are no suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations or data leaks. The only dynamic aspect is the version check for Unpack, which is standard. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation and wrapper module for boto3 paginators, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation layer for boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It strictly provides typed wrappers for AWS API pagination, adhering to official documentation and best practices.",
