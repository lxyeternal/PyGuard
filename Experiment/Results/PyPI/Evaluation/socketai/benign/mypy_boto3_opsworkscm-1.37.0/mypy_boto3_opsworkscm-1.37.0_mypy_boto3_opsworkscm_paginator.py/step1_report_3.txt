  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 opsworkscm service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and botocore.paginate; type definitions; dynamic class inheritance based on TYPE_CHECKING; class methods calling parent paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods that accept **kwargs with specific type definitions; no direct untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls to paginate with **kwargs flowing from input parameters to parent class methods; no external data flows or network connections within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or backdoors; use of conditional type imports based on Python version is standard practice; no malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginators for the boto3 opsworkscm service with type annotations and conditional imports for Python versions >= 3.12. It dynamically assigns base classes depending on TYPE_CHECKING, which is typical for type stubs. The paginate methods invoke parent class methods with type-annotated parameters, adhering to expected patterns for boto3 paginators. No suspicious behaviors, external data leaks, or malicious code are present. The structure aligns with standard boto3-stubs implementation practices, focusing on type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation layer for boto3 paginators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves as a type-safe interface without side effects or external data exfiltration.",
