{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 opsworkscm client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and botocore; type definitions from local modules; dynamic class inheritance based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable access; no data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "The code defines paginator classes that call the parent Paginator.paginate method with user-provided kwargs, returning PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for type stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe wrappers for paginators of the boto3 opsworkscm service. It imports necessary modules, defines type variables, and creates paginator classes with 'paginate' methods. No dynamic execution, network access, or data manipulation is present. The conditional imports for Python version compatibility are standard. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured type stub with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators, serving as type hints for IDEs and static analysis tools. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
