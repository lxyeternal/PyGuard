{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 opsworkscm service client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and defines classes for paginator objects.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods use **kwargs to accept input parameters, but do not process untrusted data directly; no untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows are present. The classes and methods facilitate paginated API calls with controlled parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious logic, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated sections. It is straightforward and adheres to standard patterns for boto3 stubs and paginators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type-safe paginator classes for the opsworkscm service, with clear type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation links. There are no code injection points, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The methods simply override paginate functions to accept parameters and return iterators over responses, consistent with standard boto3 paginator implementations. The code is well-structured and appears purely for type annotations and class definitions without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily serves as a type-safe interface for paginated API responses.",
