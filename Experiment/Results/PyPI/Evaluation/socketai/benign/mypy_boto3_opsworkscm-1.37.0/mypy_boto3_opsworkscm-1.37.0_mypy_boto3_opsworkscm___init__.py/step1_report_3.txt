{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the AWS OpsWorksCM service, exporting client, paginator, and waiter classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from relative paths (.client, .paginator, .waiter), and defines constants and documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up class exports and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code contains a copyright notice with a future date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of import statements, documentation, and constant definitions. It imports classes from local modules and re-exports them. The code includes a detailed docstring with example usage and a link to documentation. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic execution is present. The future-dated copyright notice is unusual but not indicative of malicious intent. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward module interface for the OpsWorksCM AWS service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exports classes and contains helpful documentation. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
