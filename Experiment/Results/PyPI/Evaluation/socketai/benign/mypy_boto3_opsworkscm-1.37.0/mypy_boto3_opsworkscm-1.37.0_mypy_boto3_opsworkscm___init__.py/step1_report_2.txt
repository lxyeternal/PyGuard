  "purpose": "Main interface for opsworkscm service, providing client, paginator, and waiter classes for interacting with AWS OpsWorksCM.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No external or untrusted input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted destinations; no sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of imports, class definitions, and documentation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes and functions from internal modules to define a client interface for the opsworkscm service. It includes documentation, licensing information, and an explicit __all__ list for exports. No external data reading, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for a service interface library.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard interface module for AWS OpsWorksCM SDK bindings. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
