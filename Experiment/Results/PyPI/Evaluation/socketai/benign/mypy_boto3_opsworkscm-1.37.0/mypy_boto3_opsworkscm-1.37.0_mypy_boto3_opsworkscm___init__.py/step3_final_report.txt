  "purpose": "Provides an interface layer for AWS OpsWorksCM service, exporting client, paginator, and waiter classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No external data sources or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports classes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright date (2025), but no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with documentation, class exports, and no dynamic or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The future date is noted but not problematic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard SDK wrapper with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
