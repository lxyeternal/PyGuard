{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the AWS OpsWorksCM service, defining clients, paginators, and waiters for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and the inline documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; primarily defining classes and importing modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets up class references and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from relative modules, defines a client alias, and exports several class references and constants. It includes a documentation string with usage examples and a copyright notice. There are no indications of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, and the code appears to be a standard interface module for AWS SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface module defining AWS OpsWorksCM client components and documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks. The implementation is standard for SDK wrapper code.",
