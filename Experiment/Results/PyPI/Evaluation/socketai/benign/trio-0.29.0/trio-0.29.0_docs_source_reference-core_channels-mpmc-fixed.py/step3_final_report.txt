{
  "purpose": "Implement a concurrent producer-consumer pattern using Trio's async channels with multiple producers and consumers, introducing random delays for variability.",
  "sources": "Producers read no external input; generate messages within loops. Consumers receive messages from cloned channels.",
  "sinks": "Consumers process received messages by printing; no external data sinks or leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Producers send messages via send_channel clones; consumers receive from receive_channel clones; data flows are internal within the async environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Use of 'random.random()' is benign for testing delays.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured async producer-consumer pattern with proper channel management and no external vulnerabilities. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. Random delays are harmless and typical for concurrency testing. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores accurately reflect its safety profile. No modifications are necessary.",
