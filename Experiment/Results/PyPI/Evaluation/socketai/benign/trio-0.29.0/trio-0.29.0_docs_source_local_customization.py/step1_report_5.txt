{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Sphinx domain directive for representing interfaces in documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, Sphinx modules, and docutils; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily registers a class and a setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Sphinx extension patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and Sphinx-specific modules, defines a class 'Interface' extending PyClasslike with methods for handling signatures and index text, and registers this class as a directive for the 'py' domain via the setup function. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The code performs standard extension registration without external input or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal Sphinx extension component for documenting interfaces, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
