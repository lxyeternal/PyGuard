  "purpose": "Define a custom Sphinx documentation directive for an interface class to enhance documentation generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library, sphinx modules, and type hints; class and function definitions; setup function adding directive.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information. No network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows or external interactions; flow is limited to class method calls for documentation processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be straightforward documentation extension. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines an Interface class extending PyClasslike with methods for handling signatures and index text. The setup function registers this class as a directive in Sphinx. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or unsafe patterns. The code is intended for documentation purposes only and does not perform any data manipulation, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx extension module that adds a custom interface directive for documentation purposes. No malicious activity or security risks detected.",
