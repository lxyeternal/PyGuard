  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports standard Sphinx and docutils modules.\n- Defines a class `Interface` extending `PyClasslike`, with methods `handle_signature` and `get_index_text`.\n- Implements a `setup` function to register this class as a directive named \"interface\" in the \"py\" domain.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward Sphinx extension component for documenting interfaces.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly extends Sphinx's documentation capabilities by adding a custom directive for interfaces.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious code, external network calls, or data leaks.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard patterns.\n- **Security risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **None observed.** The code is standard and safe.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the code is purely for documentation extension, with no external data handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns, the scores of 0 are justified.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0 or 0.9), consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No report suggests any assumptions that could lead to false positives.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign Sphinx extension component with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe, straightforward, and correctly implemented for its purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
