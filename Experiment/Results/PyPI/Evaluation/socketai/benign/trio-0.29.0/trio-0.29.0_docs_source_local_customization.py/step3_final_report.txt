  "purpose": "Defines a Sphinx extension component that adds an 'interface' directive for documenting interfaces, extending PyClasslike with signature handling and index text generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, docutils.parsers.rst, sphinx modules, and sphinx.ext.autodoc; class methods handle signature and index text; setup function registers directive.",
  "sinks": "Method handle_signature appends to signode; get_index_text returns formatted string; setup registers directive; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "handle_signature receives signature string and signode, modifies signode; get_index_text generates descriptive string; setup registers directive in Sphinx app.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard class extension and registration pattern; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign Sphinx extension component for documenting interfaces, extending existing classes, and registering a directive. It contains no malicious activity, external data handling, or obfuscation. The methods perform standard documentation tasks. All signals point to safe, standard code with high confidence. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Sphinx extension component for documenting interfaces, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
