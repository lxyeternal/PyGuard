  "purpose": "Demonstrates Trio's async task management with custom instrumentation for tracing task lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; code reads no untrusted data; internal functions and Trio's API calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is straightforward and does not process untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is clear, straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign example of Trio's asynchronous task management, with a custom Instrument subclass for tracing. It spawns two child tasks that sleep briefly, managed within a parent coroutine. The instrumentation logs task lifecycle events but does not perform any malicious actions. No external inputs, data leaks, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is educational or for debugging purposes, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended for demonstration or debugging. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
