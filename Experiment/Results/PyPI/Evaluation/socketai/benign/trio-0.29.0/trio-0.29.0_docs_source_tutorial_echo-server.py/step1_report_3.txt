{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple TCP echo server that receives data from clients and sends the same data back, primarily for testing or debugging network communication.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming data from clients via 'async for data in server_stream'. No external input other than network data is processed.",
  "sinks": "Sends data back to clients with 'await server_stream.send_all(data)'. No data is stored or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data received from clients (source) flows directly into the send_all method (sink) without modification or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code lacks any suspicious network connections or malicious payloads. Exception handling is standard and limited to logging.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a TCP server that echoes received data back to the sender. It uses Trio's asynchronous features for handling multiple clients concurrently. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leakage mechanisms, and no suspicious network behavior beyond basic echo functionality. The code structure is straightforward, with proper exception handling and comments. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no unusual data flows, or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an echo server with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It performs basic network I/O operations without suspicious activity or malicious intent.",
