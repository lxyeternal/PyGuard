  "purpose": "A simple TCP echo server that receives data from clients and echoes it back.",
  "sources": "Reading data from 'server_stream' via 'async for data in server_stream'.",
  "sinks": "Sending data back to clients with 'await server_stream.send_all(data)'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from client input to server, then back to client; logs are generated for received data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous TCP echo server implemented with Trio. It assigns a unique identifier to each connection for debugging, logs received data, and echoes it back. Exception handling is minimal but appropriate. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logging of data could be a minor concern if sensitive data is transmitted, but this is typical for debugging purposes and not malicious. The port number is within valid range and not in use by default system services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard TCP echo server with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score of approximately 0.1-0.2 reflects its simplicity and potential for misuse if exposed publicly, but the code itself is safe.",
