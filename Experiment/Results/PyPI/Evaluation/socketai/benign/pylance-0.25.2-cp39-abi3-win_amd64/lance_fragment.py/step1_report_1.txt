{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for handling dataset fragments, metadata, and data file management within a larger data processing system, specifically for writing, merging, deleting, and retrieving dataset fragments.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources such as pa.Table, pa.RecordBatchReader, file paths, or dataset objects; configuration parameters like schema, filter expressions, and dataset URIs.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate or modify fragment metadata, data files, or perform dataset mutations like delete or merge; also writes data fragments to storage.",
  "flows": "Input data is coerced and passed through functions that create or modify fragments, which then produce metadata, data files, or write data to storage. Deletion predicates and merge schemas flow into mutation operations. Metadata and fragments flow between creation, deletion, and merging functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses warnings.warn for deprecation notices and deprecated parameters, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No use of unsafe eval or dynamic code execution detected. No suspicious network or system commands are present. The code appears standard for dataset and fragment management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions, dataset fragment handling, and functions for writing, creating, merging, and deleting fragments. All operations are high-level dataset management tasks, with no direct system commands, network operations, or security-sensitive data handling like credential management. The functions perform data manipulations and metadata handling with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Use of warnings for deprecated features indicates maintenance but no malicious intent. The code follows standard patterns for dataset fragment management without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of dataset fragment management with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. It performs normal data handling, metadata serialization, and dataset mutation operations without suspicious or malicious code components.",
