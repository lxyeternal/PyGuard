  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension for image and tensor handling in PyArrow, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The only potential security concern is the handling of untrusted external URLs in 'read_uris', which is a standard risk in such functionalities but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical network I/O with untrusted sources. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for supply chain use."
