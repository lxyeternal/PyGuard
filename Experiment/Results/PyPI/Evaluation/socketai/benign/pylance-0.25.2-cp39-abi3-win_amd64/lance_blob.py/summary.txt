  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard dataset binary data access. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the slight security risk scores are appropriate given the context of handling untrusted binary data."
