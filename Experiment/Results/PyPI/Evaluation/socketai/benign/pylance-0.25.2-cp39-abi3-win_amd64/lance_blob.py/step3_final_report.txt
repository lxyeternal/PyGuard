  "purpose": "Utility classes for handling binary data in PyArrow datasets, providing iteration and file-like interfaces for binary columns and dataset blobs.",
  "sources": "PyArrow binary columns, LanceBlobFile instances used within BlobFile methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Reading binary data from pyarrow arrays or LanceBlobFile, converting to BytesIO objects or passing through BlobFile wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard validation and data handling without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for accessing binary data within datasets, with proper type checks and standard file-like method implementations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The logic is clear, and the code relies on trusted libraries. No malicious patterns or vulnerabilities are evident. The small security risk score in some reports reflects the handling of potentially untrusted binary data, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard dataset binary data access. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the slight security risk scores are appropriate given the context of handling untrusted binary data.",
