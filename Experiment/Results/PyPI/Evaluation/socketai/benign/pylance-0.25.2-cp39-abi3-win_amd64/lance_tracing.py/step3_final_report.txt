  "purpose": "A utility function to initiate tracing of lance events and export them to a Chrome trace file, ensuring cleanup on process exit.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'file' and 'level' provided to the function; external call to 'lance_trace_to_chrome'.",
  "sinks": "The external function 'lance_trace_to_chrome' which handles tracing; no direct sinks for untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'lance_trace_to_chrome'; the returned guard object registers a cleanup callback that calls 'finish_tracing' at exit.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward wrapper with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured wrapper around an external tracing utility, managing setup and cleanup via 'atexit'. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or code execution beyond calling the external function. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of 'atexit' for cleanup is standard. The external dependency 'lance' is assumed trustworthy based on context. The overall design is benign and intended for debugging or profiling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign tracing utility with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1). These scores are appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.",
