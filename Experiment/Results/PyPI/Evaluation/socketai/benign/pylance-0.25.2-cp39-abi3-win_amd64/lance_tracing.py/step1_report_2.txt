{
  "purpose": "Provides a function to start tracing lance events and automatically saves the trace data to a file upon program exit.",
  "sources": "User can specify an output file name via the 'file' parameter; no other input sources present.",
  "sinks": "The 'guard.finish_tracing()' method is called at program exit, which may finalize the tracing process.",
  "flows": "The function calls 'lance_trace_to_chrome' with parameters, then registers an exit callback to finish tracing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. No network activity or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a function that initializes tracing, and registers an exit handler to finalize tracing. All operations are straightforward and related to file handling and process cleanup. No external data sources, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard tracing setup and cleanup functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
