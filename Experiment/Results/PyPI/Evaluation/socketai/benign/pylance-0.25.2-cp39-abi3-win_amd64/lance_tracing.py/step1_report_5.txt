{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function to start tracing lance events and automatically finishes tracing when the Python process exits.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'file' and 'level' in the function, and the imported function 'lance_trace_to_chrome'.",
  "sinks": "The 'file' parameter, which specifies output trace file location; 'level' parameter affecting tracing detail; 'lance_trace_to_chrome' internally may involve file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'lance_trace_to_chrome', and the 'guard.finish_tracing()' method is called at program exit via atexit registration to finalize tracing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code uses standard library and calls an external function; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to start a tracing process, with optional file and detail level parameters. It imports a tracing function and registers a cleanup callback at exit. The function appears to be a straightforward setup for tracing, with no evident malicious behavior. No sensitive data handling or suspicious network activity is present. The reliance on an external 'lance_trace_to_chrome' function is standard, and no anomalies are detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign tracing utility setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages tracing lifecycle with proper cleanup. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.",
