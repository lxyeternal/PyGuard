{
  "purpose": "The code configures logging for a Python application, allowing environment-based log level setting and customizable log handlers.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LANCE_LOG', function parameters (file_path, level, log_handler).",
  "sinks": "Log file specified by 'file_path', logging output (potentially sensitive info if logs contain secrets).",
  "flows": "Environment variable reading -> get_log_level() -> set_logger() -> logging output to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed; no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically sets log levels based on environment variables, provides a configurable logger setup, and uses standard Python logging. It does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. There is no evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup for Python, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It handles configuration safely and without suspicious patterns.",
