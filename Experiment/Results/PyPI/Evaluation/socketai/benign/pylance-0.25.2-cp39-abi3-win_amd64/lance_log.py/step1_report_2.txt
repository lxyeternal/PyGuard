  "purpose": "Configure logging levels and handlers for the 'pylance' module based on environment variables or parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LANCE_LOG', function parameters, and the code itself for logger configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers, particularly file handlers that write logs to specified files.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LANCE_LOG' influences log level setting, which affects logger behavior. set_logger configures log handlers and levels based on function arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard logging configuration patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to determine log levels, maps Rust log levels to Python equivalents, and sets up logging handlers, including file handlers. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed in a way that could lead to security issues. The code manages logging configuration securely and appropriately. No suspicious or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles environment variables and logging setup without any malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.",
