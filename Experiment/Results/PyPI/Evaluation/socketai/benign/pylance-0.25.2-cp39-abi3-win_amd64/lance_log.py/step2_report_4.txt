  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard logging setup code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None observed. The logic for environment variable parsing and log level mapping appears correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 — **Unreasonable.** The report assigns a high risk score despite no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, the risk score should be near zero. The high score overstates the security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's high risk score is unjustified; it should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No suspicious or malicious behavior. Standard logging configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The logic is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 — **Unreasonable.** No security issues are present.\n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any malicious actions; high risk score is unwarranted.\n- **Conclusion:** Reduce risk score to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard logging setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 — **Unreasonable.** No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Justification:** No security risk exists; the score should be 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Lower to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 — **Unreasonable.** No security concerns.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard logging configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1 — **Unreasonable.** No security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Lower to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** Overestimated in all reports; given the code's nature, the risk should be near zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent across reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** for all reports, as the code is standard logging setup with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward logging configuration module, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The high risk scores assigned in the reports are unjustified and should be revised downward to reflect the actual security posture.",
