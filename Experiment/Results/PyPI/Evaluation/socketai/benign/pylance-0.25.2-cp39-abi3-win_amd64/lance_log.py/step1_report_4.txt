{
  "purpose": "Configure and manage logging levels and handlers for the 'pylance' module based on environment variables and function parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LANCE_LOG' for log level configuration; function parameters for log file path, name, level, format string, and handlers.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; standard logging setup does not typically leak data unless log content includes sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LANCE_LOG' influences log level; 'set_logger' function configures logging handlers and levels based on inputs, affecting where logs are stored and their format.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. Use of environment variables and logging setup appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to map Rust log levels to Python, determine log levels based on environment variables, and configure a logger with optional file handlers. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modification. The environment variable 'LANCE_LOG' controls log verbosity, but this is a common practice. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard logging configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration module with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It allows configurable logging levels and handlers but does not perform any harmful operations.",
