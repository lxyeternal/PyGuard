  "purpose": "Configure logging for the application, setting log levels based on environment variables and allowing customization of log handlers and formats.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LANCE_LOG' for log level; function calls for setting logger and handlers.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs via FileHandler or custom log handlers; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read influences get_log_level() -> sets LOGGER level; set_logger() configures handlers and formatters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard logging setup with environment variable parsing; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration module. It reads an environment variable to determine log level, maps 'trace' to 'DEBUG', and filters out entries with '=' to avoid misconfigurations. The set_logger function allows customization of log handlers, formats, and levels. There are no network calls, data leaks, code obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The environment variable handling and logger setup are standard practices. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-structured, simple, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior. The environment variable influences logging levels in a typical manner. The overall security assessment is very low risk, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
