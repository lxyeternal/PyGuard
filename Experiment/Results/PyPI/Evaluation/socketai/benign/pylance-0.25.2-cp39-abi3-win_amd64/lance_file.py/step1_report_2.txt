  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for reading and writing Lance data files, including metadata handling and data batch processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input paths (string or Path objects), and storage options (dictionary).",
  "sinks": "Returns data buffers, metadata objects, and file statistics; writes data batches and metadata.",
  "flows": "Input paths and storage options → FileReader/FileWriter objects → Data reading/writing methods → Output buffers, metadata, and statistics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. Usage of standard library and third-party modules (pyarrow) appears legitimate. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no backdoors, or covert data exfiltration methods identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of file I/O abstractions for Lance datasets, leveraging pyarrow and internal Lance modules. It handles paths, schema, buffers, and metadata without any embedded or hidden malicious logic. No code injection, network calls, or data leaks are detected. The code includes only standard patterns for resource management, data batching, and metadata handling. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The overall structure appears safe and consistent with typical data processing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a secure and standard implementation for managing Lance data files. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from the provided code. It is safe for use in data processing pipelines.",
