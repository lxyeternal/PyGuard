  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data conversion utility with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is resource exhaustion risk from processing untrusted images, which is appropriately reflected in the low risk scores. No modifications to the existing scores are necessary; they are consistent with the analysis."
