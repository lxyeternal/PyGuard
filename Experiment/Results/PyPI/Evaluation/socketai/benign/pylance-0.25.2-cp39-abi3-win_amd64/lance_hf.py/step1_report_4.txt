  "purpose": "Utility class for converting PyArrow RecordBatch data to Huggingface internal types, including images and tensors.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pa.StructScalar in _to_pil_image and from pa.Array in to_pytorch, as well as dataset info from ds_info.",
  "sinks": "Uses PIL.Image.open() which could load images from file paths or byte streams; no direct sink of untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "Extracts image data from scalar or array, converts via PIL.Image.open() to return images, and may process tensor info from dataset features.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional logic for image bytes and paths appears standard; no unusual or suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, no malicious network activity, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for converting dataset features into images or tensors. It imports necessary modules lazily inside functions to avoid unnecessary dependencies at import time. The image conversion reads image data either from byte streams or file paths without modification, which is standard. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or security issues are present. The try-except handles missing dataset feature keys gracefully. Overall, the code performs standard data conversion tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for data conversion, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It relies on well-known libraries PIL and PyArrow without misuse. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
