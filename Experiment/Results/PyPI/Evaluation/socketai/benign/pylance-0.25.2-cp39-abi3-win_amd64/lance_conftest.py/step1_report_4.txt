{
  "purpose": "Set up environment variables and seed for reproducibility in testing, and configure temporary working directory for tests",
  "sources": "Environment variables (NO_COLOR, COLUMNS), numpy.random.seed, pytest fixtures",
  "targets": "Not directly used for data leakage or malicious activity; environment variables influence test display/configuration",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set at the start; seed affects numpy random functions; fixtures modify environment and directory for testing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present; code appears standard for testing setup",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables to control test output formatting, establishes a fixed seed for numpy's random generator to ensure reproducibility, and uses pytest fixtures to set up a temporary directory for tests. All actions are typical for test environment configuration. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup script that configures environment variables, random seed, and working directory. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
