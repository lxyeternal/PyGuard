  "purpose": "Set up environment variables and working directory for testing, and initialize reproducibility seed.",
  "sources": "os.environ modifications, numpy.random.seed, import statements",
  "targets": "No untrusted data or external systems; environment variables influence test environment only",
  "flows": "Environment variables set -> test environment configuration; seed set -> reproducibility",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test setup code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, sets a fixed seed for numpy.random, and defines a pytest fixture that modifies environment variables and changes the working directory using monkeypatch. It performs environment setup typical for testing, with no network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The environment variables are set in a controlled, temporary context, and the seed ensures reproducibility. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and the code is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard test environment setup. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior is present. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
