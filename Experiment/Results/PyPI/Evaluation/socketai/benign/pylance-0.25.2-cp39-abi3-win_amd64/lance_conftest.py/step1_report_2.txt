  "flows": [
    "Environment variable modifications -> potential influence on subprocesses or other environment-dependent code",
    "Random seed setting -> deterministic behavior in randomness, unlikely to cause security issues"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed. Usage of standard testing fixtures and environment setup is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and sets up a testing environment with environment variables for color output and column width. It also initializes numpy's random seed to ensure reproducible randomness during tests. All operations are typical for test setup and do not contain malicious logic or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup script configuring environment variables and setting a random seed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
