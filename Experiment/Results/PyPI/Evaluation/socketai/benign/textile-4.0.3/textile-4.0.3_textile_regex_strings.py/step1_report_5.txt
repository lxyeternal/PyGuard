{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define various regular expressions for pattern matching, likely intended for text processing or parsing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own source to define regex patterns, conditional imports, and character sets based on environment or available modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks in this code; no data is sent over networks, stored insecurely, or used in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, defining regex patterns based on available modules, and setting string constants for regex matching.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, mainly defining regex patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import the 'regex' module for advanced pattern matching; if unavailable, it falls back to 'sys.maxunicode' to generate character ranges. It defines multiple regex pattern strings for matching various text features such as uppercase, lowercase, digits, spaces, symbols, and table cell attributes. The patterns involve complex regex constructs and Unicode considerations, but all appear to serve text parsing functions. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as network communication, system manipulation, or obfuscated code, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of regex pattern definitions used for text processing tasks. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
