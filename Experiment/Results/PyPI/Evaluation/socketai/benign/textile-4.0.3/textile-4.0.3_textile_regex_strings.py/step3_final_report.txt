  "purpose": "Define regex pattern strings for Unicode text parsing, HTML attribute matching, and related text processing tasks, with conditional imports for 'regex' or fallback to 'sys' and 're'-like behavior.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; it defines static regex pattern strings used for text parsing and validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets pattern strings without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in fallback pattern 'acr': r'{0}0-9' which likely intended to be r'{0}-0-9' or similar; resource-intensive Unicode string generation in fallback code, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static regex pattern definitions for Unicode and HTML attribute matching, with conditional import logic. No dynamic data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The fallback code for Unicode ranges is standard but may be inefficient. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are detected. The only notable issue is a probable typo in the fallback 'acr' pattern, which could affect regex matching but not security. The malware score is correctly 0, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1), primarily due to the fallback implementation's minor inefficiency, not malicious activity. The code's purpose appears benign and utility-focused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for regex pattern definitions related to Unicode and text parsing. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The minor typo in the fallback pattern is a bug but not security-related. The scores assigned across reports are consistent and appropriate, with no need for escalation.",
