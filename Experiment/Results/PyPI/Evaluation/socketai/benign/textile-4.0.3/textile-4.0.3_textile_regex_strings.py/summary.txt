  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for regex pattern definitions related to Unicode and text parsing. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The minor typo in the fallback pattern is a bug but not security-related. The scores assigned across reports are consistent and appropriate, with no need for escalation."
