  "purpose": "Define regex patterns for text processing, with fallback for environment-specific unicode handling.",
  "sources": "Imports regex module or sys.maxunicode; defines regex pattern strings.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Uses conditional import to set regex patterns; defines regex strings for various text attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden data exfiltration, or malicious logic; fallback code is standard for unicode handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a regex library for advanced Unicode pattern matching. If unavailable, it falls back to a unicode-aware pattern generation based on sys.maxunicode. It then defines various regex pattern strings for text attributes such as alignment, language, style, table span attributes, class/style/language attribute matching, punctuation, and symbols. The code is solely for pattern matching and text parsing purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior. The fallback logic and pattern definitions are standard for robust regex usage. There are no external data flows, data leaks, or malicious code embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, security-safe setup for regex pattern definitions, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is likely part of a larger text processing library or module, designed for pattern matching in HTML, XML, or similar documents.",
