{
  "purpose": "The code defines various regular expressions for pattern matching, including handling Unicode characters and fallback mechanisms for missing modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'regex' or 'sys' modules, Unicode character range generation, and regex pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from module imports to regex pattern definitions, with no input/output operations or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The pattern definitions are straightforward and typical for regex operations.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up regex patterns for text matching, with conditional import logic for the 'regex' module or fallback for the standard 're' module, including Unicode-aware patterns. It appears to be a utility module for regex pattern definitions, without any external input handling, network operations, or data leakage mechanisms. No malicious behaviors, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The code is well-structured and focused solely on regex pattern setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a pattern matching utility with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely configuration and pattern definition logic, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
