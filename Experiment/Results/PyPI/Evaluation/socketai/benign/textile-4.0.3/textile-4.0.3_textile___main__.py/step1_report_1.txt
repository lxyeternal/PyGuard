{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool that converts Textile markup language input into HTML output.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file or stdin, accesses textile module's VERSION attribute and textile function.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to a file or stdout; accesses textile module's attributes and functions.",
  "flows": "Input source (file or stdin) -> textile.textile() -> output sink (file or stdout).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns, standard use of argparse and textile library.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse for input handling, reading data from specified files or stdin, then processes the input via textile.textile(). It only accesses the textile module's version and processing functions, with no external network or system modifications. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code evident. The use of textile library appears standard and safe. No anomalous code, secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper around the textile library for converting Textile markup to HTML. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified.",
