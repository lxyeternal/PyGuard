{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool to convert textile markup into HTML output, reading from files or stdin and writing to files or stdout.",
  "sources": "User-supplied filenames or stdin, as well as reading from those files; no external or untrusted sources are explicitly read beyond user input.",
  "sinks": "Writing output to user-specified files or stdout; no data leakage or malicious sink behavior observed.",
  "flows": "Input files or stdin -> textile.textile() processing -> output to files or stdout; no external network or sensitive data transmission involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper around the textile library, handling input/output streams with optional file parameters. It properly manages resources with 'with' statements. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The textile library's usage appears standard; the version display feature is benign. No suspicious obfuscation or hidden code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for textile markup conversion. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It simply processes user-supplied files or stdin and outputs results, with no external network interactions or sensitive data handling.",
