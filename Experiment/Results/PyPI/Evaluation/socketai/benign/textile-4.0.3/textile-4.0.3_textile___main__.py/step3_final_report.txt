  "purpose": "A CLI tool to convert Textile markup to HTML using the textile library.",
  "sources": "Reading input from a file or stdin; accessing textile.VERSION",
  "sinks": "Writing output to a file or stdout",
  "flows": "Input read -> textile.textile() processing -> output written",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of textile library; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI wrapper around the textile library, handling input/output streams and version display. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or contain suspicious patterns. The textile library is used solely for markup conversion. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. The code's structure and behavior are standard and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward CLI utility for Textile to HTML conversion. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
