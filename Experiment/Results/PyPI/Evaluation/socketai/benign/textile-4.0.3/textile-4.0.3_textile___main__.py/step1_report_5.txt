  "purpose": "A command-line tool for converting Textile markup to HTML using the textile module.",
  "sources": "Reading input from a file or stdin; reading version information from textile.VERSION.",
  "sinks": "Writing converted HTML output to a file or stdout; printing version information.",
  "flows": "Input data read from infile or stdin flows into textile.textile function; version info from textile.VERSION is printed; output flows from textile.textile to outfile or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Use of standard argument parsing and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CLI interface for Textile to HTML conversion. It uses argparse for input/output files and version display. The input is read from files or stdin, processed via textile.textile, then written to files or stdout. Textile module's version is printed if requested. No untrusted data handling or security-sensitive operations are evident. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for Textile conversion with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly handles input/output streams and invokes the textile library as expected.",
