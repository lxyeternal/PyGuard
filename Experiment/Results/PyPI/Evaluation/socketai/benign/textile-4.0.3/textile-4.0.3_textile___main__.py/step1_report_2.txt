  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool to convert textile markup to HTML output.",
  "sources": "Reading from infile or stdin; reading version from textile.VERSION",
  "sinks": "Writing to outfile or stdout; printing textile.VERSION",
  "flows": "Input data read from infile or stdin -> textile.textile processing -> output written to outfile or stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse for command-line argument parsing, reading input either from a specified file or stdin, and outputting either to a file or stdout. It calls textile.textile to process the input data and prints the textile.VERSION when requested. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious network activity. The use of textile library is standard and does not appear suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI wrapper for the textile library, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It functions as a typical utility script without any malicious behaviors.",
