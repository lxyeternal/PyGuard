  "purpose": "Package initialization script importing internal modules and setting version info",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .version modules",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or external communication",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports specific components from internal modules, defines __all__ and __version__, and contains no dynamic or external operations. No data handling, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code is static, clear, and typical for Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature.",
