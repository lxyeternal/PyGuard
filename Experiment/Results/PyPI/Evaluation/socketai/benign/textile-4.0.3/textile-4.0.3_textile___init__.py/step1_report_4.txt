  "purpose": "This module appears to import core components and version information related to a Textile processing library, and sets export variables.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.core and .version)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "Imports from core and version modules, then sets __all__ and __version__ variables",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Import statements are standard and do not pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from internal modules, which is typical for package initialization. It assigns module export variables. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external network interactions. No suspicious patterns or malicious code indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file setting up module exports and versioning. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
