{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific components from local modules and sets module-level attributes for versioning and export control.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .core and .version",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no code execution, data leakage, or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; simply assigns imported data to module attributes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific elements from local modules, declares exported symbols, and assigns version info. All operations are static and involve no user input, external data, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It is a minimal module setup typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any suspicious operations or contain hidden malicious code.",
