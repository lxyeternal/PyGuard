{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's initialization module, importing specific components from internal modules and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core and .version), specifically 'textile', 'textile_restricted', 'Textile', and 'VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage or execution of untrusted data; the code does not handle external input or perform any output or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns imported values to module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a package __init__.py file. No unusual or suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from internal modules and defines the __all__ and __version__ variables. It functions solely to organize module exports and package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data handling, or security risks. The imports are from internal, presumably trusted modules, and there are no external data inputs or system commands executed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package initialization script with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It only manages module exports and versioning information.",
