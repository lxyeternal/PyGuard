  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard package __init__.py setup, with no malicious activity, data handling, or external communication.\n- The code snippets are minimal, importing internal modules and setting module-level variables.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The reported \"malware\" scores are all zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code provided matches the descriptions: straightforward imports, setting `__all__` and `__version__`.\n- No code execution, external data handling, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- The code is typical for a Python package's initialization module.\n\n### Flaws or errors in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- The scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n- Since all reports agree on zero malware and security risk, and the code is static, no changes are necessary.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- The risk scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n- No higher scores are justified because there is no evidence of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as zero; the code does not perform any malicious operations.\n- No need to challenge this.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code is static and does not handle user input or external data, so no assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted.\n- The reports correctly avoid speculation.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a typical, benign package initialization script with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scoring reflects the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes are needed. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
