{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import and export configuration, primarily setting up references to internal components and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.core and .version), specifically 'textile', 'textile_restricted', 'Textile', and 'VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; the code does not handle untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident; the code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from internal modules and sets up the module's public API with __all__, while also defining the package version. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package initialization code with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It simply exposes certain components and version information.",
