  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code snippets are all very similar: they import specific components from internal modules (.core and .version), define `__all__` and `__version__`, and contain no dynamic or external operations.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no external network communication, no execution of system commands, and no handling of user input.\n- The code appears to be a standard package `__init__.py` setup, establishing module exports and versioning.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Correctly states that the code is static, with no malicious activity, and no anomalies.  \n   - The confidence score is 1, which seems appropriate.  \n   - Malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity.  \n   - Risk score is 0, justified by the lack of any security concern.  \n   - No issues here.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Also accurately describes the code as a straightforward package initialization script.  \n   - Correctly assigns a confidence of 1 and malware score of 0.  \n   - Security risk is 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - No issues.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Similar to previous, correctly identifies the code as a benign package setup.  \n   - Confidence is 1, malware 0, risk 0.  \n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n   - No issues.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Consistent with others; standard import and export setup.  \n   - Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.  \n   - No anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n   - No issues.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same conclusion: standard package initialization code, no malicious or security concerns.  \n   - Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.  \n   - No anomalies.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard package initialization script.  \n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary. The analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
