{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive Textile parser converting Textile markup into HTML, supporting lists, tables, links, images, footnotes, and typographic glyphs.",
  "sources": "User input Textile text, URL references stored in internal dictionaries (urlrefs, shelf, fn, refCache).",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML output, stored URL snippets, and shelved HTML fragments for later retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input flows into regex-based parsing, internal shelving, URL encoding/decoding, and HTML generation; references and URLs are stored and later rendered.",
  "anomalies": "No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. Shelving and retrieval are standard for parsers; regex complexity is typical and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs regex for parsing Textile syntax, internal dictionaries for managing references and snippets, URL encoding/decoding, and sanitization. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors. The regex patterns are complex but standard for markup parsing. Shelving mechanisms are typical for such parsers, and no external network calls or obfuscated code are present. The code is transparent, well-structured, and aligns with common Textile parser implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented Textile parser with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The internal mechanisms are typical, and no vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
