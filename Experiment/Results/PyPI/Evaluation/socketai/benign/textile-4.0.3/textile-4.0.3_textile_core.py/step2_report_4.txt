  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the logical consistency, code behavior, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The parser converts Textile markup to HTML, with features like lists, tables, links, images, footnotes, and typographic glyphs. Inputs are Textile text and URL references, stored in internal dictionaries. Sinks include HTML output, URL references, and shelved snippets. No external network or system calls are detected. The code sanitizes output if requested.\n\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes that the code employs regex for parsing, internal shelves for HTML snippets, and URL encoding/decoding. No malicious behaviors or external network activity are observed. The internal storage mechanisms are typical for parsers, and no evidence of sabotage or malware.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The overall security risk is low. The report's confidence (0.9) is justified, and no obfuscation or malware is evident.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed analysis of the parsing process, URL handling, and internal storage. It emphasizes that no active malicious behavior is detected, though regex complexity could be exploited with crafted input.\n\n- **Analysis:** The detailed review of URL parsing and internal shelves confirms that no malicious code or network activity exists. The potential for regex-based exploitation is noted, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The parser is standard, with minimal security risk. The malware score remains at 0.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Observation:** \"Empty response\" — no analysis provided.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Cannot assess security based on no data. This report should be disregarded or marked as insufficient.\n\n---\n\n**Reports 4 and 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Both describe the parser as a comprehensive Textile-to-HTML converter, emphasizing regex-based parsing, internal shelving, URL handling, and sanitization. They find no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The functions are standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Analysis:** The detailed reasoning confirms that the code operates within expected parameters for such a parser. The internal shelving mechanisms are common and do not imply malicious intent. The regex complexity is typical for markup parsing and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious exploitation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The overall security risk is minimal, with no malware detected.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code is a standard Textile parser employing regex, URL encoding, and internal caching. No external network activity, code injection, or obfuscated code is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports confirm the code is transparent, with no signs of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the risk score should be very low, around 0.2 or less, reflecting typical parser complexity but no active threats.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — standard parser with regex complexity, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-implemented Textile parser with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The complexity and internal shelving are typical for such parsers and do not indicate malicious activity.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown per specific feature or further analysis.",
