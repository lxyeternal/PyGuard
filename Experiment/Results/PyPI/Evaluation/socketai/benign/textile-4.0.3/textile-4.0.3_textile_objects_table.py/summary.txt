  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Textile-to-HTML parser with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by regex parsing complexity but no actual exploits. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature."
