  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a Textile-to-HTML parser for tables, with regex parsing and HTML generation. No malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The malware score is 0, and confidence is high (0.9). The report correctly identifies the code's purpose and security posture.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Potential concern:** The report mentions that 'generate_tag' is external but assumes it's safe. Given the context, this is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code's purpose as a Textile parser, with no suspicious activity. Malware score is 0, and confidence is high (0.9). It notes regex parsing and HTML generation without malicious patterns.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0 is appropriate; no evidence of malware.\n- **Potential concern:** The report emphasizes that no untrusted data flows to system commands or network, which aligns with safe behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a Textile parser converting markup to HTML tables, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Score justification:** No malware detected; the code is purely markup parsing and HTML generation.\n- **Potential concern:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports—parsing Textile markup into HTML, no malicious behavior, no network or system modification. Malware score is 0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate; no malware.\n- **Potential concern:** Uses external functions presumed safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: straightforward Textile-to-HTML conversion, regex parsing, no malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence 1.\n- **Score justification:** No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and based on the code review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low risk scores (0 to 0.2), which is appropriate given the code's functionality.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is safe.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code is low risk, primarily parsing and HTML generation.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code relies on external functions (`generate_tag`, `parse_attributes`), but nothing indicates these are malicious.\n- Regex patterns are standard for parsing markup, not obfuscated or malicious.\n- No network, file system, or environment variable manipulations are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the code is safe. I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any suspicious activity.",
