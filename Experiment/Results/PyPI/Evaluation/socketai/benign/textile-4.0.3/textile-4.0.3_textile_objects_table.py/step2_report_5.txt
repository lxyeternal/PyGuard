  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code parses Textile table markup into HTML, with regex-based parsing and HTML generation via external functions.\n- **Findings:** No signs of code injection, malicious payloads, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The report notes the absence of suspicious logic.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on parsing Textile into HTML tables.\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious activity, network calls, or data exfiltration. The code relies on regex and external safe functions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, but the report justifies it as minimal, given the lack of external system interaction.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with minor security risk possibly due to regex parsing.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also a Textile parser for tables, with regex parsing and HTML generation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the lack of external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar parsing and HTML generation for Textile tables.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activities or suspicious patterns. Uses standard regex and external utility functions.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0.1 and 0, respectively, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard Textile-to-HTML table parser.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, network calls, or obfuscation. Uses regex and utility functions in a typical manner.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a Textile parser converting Textile markup into HTML tables. The code relies on regex parsing, attribute handling, and HTML generation functions (`generate_tag`, `parse_attributes`) which are external but presumably safe.\n\n- **Malicious Behavior & Risks:** No report indicates any signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration. The regex parsing, while extensive, is standard for markup processing and does not inherently pose security risks.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports' scores are reasonable given the analysis. The malware scores are 0, and risk scores are very low, reflecting the safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, justified by regex parsing but no real security concern.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.**",
