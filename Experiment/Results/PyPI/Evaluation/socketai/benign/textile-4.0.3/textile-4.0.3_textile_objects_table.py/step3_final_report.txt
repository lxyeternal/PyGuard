  "purpose": "Parse Textile table markup into HTML table elements, handling captions, colgroups, and table sections.",
  "sources": "Input string containing Textile table markup, including caption, colgroup, and table rows.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML string representing the table structure; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input Textile markup → regex parsing of captions, colgroups, and rows → creation of HTML tags via generate_tag → output HTML string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. Use of regex is standard for markup parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Textile to HTML parser focusing on table structures, utilizing regex for parsing captions, colgroups, and rows. It constructs HTML elements via external functions, with no network or system modifications. Regex patterns are standard and do not suggest obfuscation. No malicious payloads, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's purpose is straightforward, and its structure is clear. External functions are presumed safe, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Textile-to-HTML parser with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by regex parsing complexity but no actual exploits. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
