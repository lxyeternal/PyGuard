  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning accuracy, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code parses Textile table markup into HTML, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; regex parsing and HTML generation are standard.\n- No evidence of malicious code, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration.\n- The score of malware=0 aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk=0 is justified given the absence of network or system access.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on parsing Textile tables into HTML with standard regex and HTML generation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) despite no evidence of external data or code injection.\n- The reasoning emphasizes standard parsing, no suspicious activity.\n- The marginal increase might reflect cautiousness but isn't necessarily justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware=0 score is appropriate. The securityRisk=0.2 is perhaps slightly high but still within reason considering the complexity of regex parsing, which could, in theory, be exploited if regex patterns are maliciously crafted. However, given the code as presented, no actual malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a Textile parser converting to HTML, no malicious activity, standard regex usage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with previous reports; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The securityRisk=0.1 is conservative but acceptable, considering regex parsing could be exploited if patterns are malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable, given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion—standard Textile to HTML parser, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning applies; no malicious behavior detected.\n- The low securityRisk score aligns with the absence of external or unsafe operations.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard parsing, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The highest confidence (1) and no security risk are justified.\n- The code is straightforward, with regex parsing and HTML generation, which are common and safe in this context.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any network operations, code injection, or dynamic execution.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) in some reports, but given the regex parsing, a minimal risk score is acceptable if regex patterns are crafted maliciously. However, no such patterns are evident here.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to regex parsing, but no actual exploit evidence)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and standard for Textile to HTML conversion. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\nThe overall risk remains very low, with no indication of malware or malicious obfuscation.",
