  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\nfrom .block import Block\nfrom .table import Table\n\n__all__ = ['Block', 'Table']\n```\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal module setup, importing two classes (`Block` and `Table`) from local modules and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- There are no data flows, external data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard `__init__.py` or module export file in a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** No, the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None evident.\n- **Malware:** No, the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** None, as it only manages imports and exports.\n\n### Issues in the Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The reasoning is consistent across reports; they do not attribute any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is purely for module exports, it cannot contain malicious logic or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; their conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a standard module initialization pattern, common in Python packages.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
