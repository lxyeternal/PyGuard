{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing 'Block' and 'Table' classes from local modules and defining __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.block' and '.table' modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import and export",
  "flows": "Import statements (sources) lead to __all__ declaration (sink), but no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module setup for exports, with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores as 0. The code contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
