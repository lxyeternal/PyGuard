{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for a package, specifically exporting the 'Block' and 'Table' classes or functions from local modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.block' and '.table' modules",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is relevant here as the code only performs imports and export declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets present; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components ('Block' and 'Table') from local modules and defines '__all__' for explicit export. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions that could pose security risks. The simplicity and standard structure suggest it is a typical module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious activity.",
