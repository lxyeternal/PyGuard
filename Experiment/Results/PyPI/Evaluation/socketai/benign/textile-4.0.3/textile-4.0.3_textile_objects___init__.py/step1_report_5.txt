{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an __all__ list for module exports, likely as part of a package's __init__.py file, to expose Block and Table classes.",
  "sources": "Imports of .block and .table modules, and the assignment to __all__",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing two classes from sibling modules and defining an export list. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns. It functions as typical package initialization code, facilitating module exports without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an initializer to expose specific classes from the package. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
