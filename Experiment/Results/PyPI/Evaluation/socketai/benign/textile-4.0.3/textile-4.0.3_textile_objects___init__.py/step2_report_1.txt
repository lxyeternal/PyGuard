  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code is a minimal module setup that imports `Block` and `Table` from local modules and declares `__all__` for explicit exports.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for Python package initialization files, such as `__init__.py`.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual code behaviors are detected.\n   - The code's purpose is purely to set up module exports.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n   - Confidence is high (1), as all analyses agree.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - No report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk, malware, or obfuscated score.\n   - The purpose of the code is purely structural, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - The code is a standard module export setup, common in Python packages.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware are justified here.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware          | 0                 | No malicious activity or code behavior present.                            |\n| obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.                        |\n| securityRisk     | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected.                            |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe report's scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no security concerns. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, standard module export declaration.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
