  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   The code simply imports two classes (`Block` and `Table`) from local modules (`.block` and `.table`) and declares `__all__` to specify what gets exported when the module is imported. This is a common pattern in Python packages, typically in an `__init__.py` file.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code does not contain any data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - There are no logical errors or security flaws in this minimal code snippet.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and typical for a package setup.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - The overall risk scores are 0 or very close to it, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - Since all evidence points to this being a simple, benign module export, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No suspicious claims are made; all analyses are cautious and accurate.\n   - The code does not attempt to perform any actions that could be malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports, correctly reflecting the benign nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard module initialization pattern, with no malicious or security concern.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and overall risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The confidence should stay at **1** given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:\nThis is a benign, standard Python module export snippet with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
