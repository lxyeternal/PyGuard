  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence verification**:\n   - The code snippet provided is a minimal module setup that imports `Block` and `Table` from local modules and defines `__all__` for exports.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: the code is a simple module export setup.\n   - No logical errors or omissions are apparent; the analysis correctly states that there's no malicious activity or security concern.\n\n3. **Scores review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:\n   - Since all assessments indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, scores above 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard module export file with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are needed.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores reflect the absence of malware, obfuscation, or risk.\n- No further action required.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation or further analysis.",
