{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define exports for a Python module, specifically exporting 'Block' and 'Table' classes from local modules.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Block' from '.block' and 'Table' from '.table', which are local module imports within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this code; the code only sets up exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely for module exports and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple module initialization file, defining which classes are exported when the module is imported. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain any logic that could be malicious. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code strictly serves as an interface for module exports.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this code. It is a standard module export setup with no indicators of malware or security concerns.",
