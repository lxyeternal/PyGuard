{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python module that exports the Block and Table classes for use elsewhere, likely as part of a larger library or project.",
  "sources": "Imports of .block and .table modules; no input data sources or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from relative modules and declares an __all__ list for explicit export. There are no dynamic evaluations, user inputs, or external data interactions. The structure is typical for Python package modules. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present in this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module definition that exports two classes, with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger package.",
