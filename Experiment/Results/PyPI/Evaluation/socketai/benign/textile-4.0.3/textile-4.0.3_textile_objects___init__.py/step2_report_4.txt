  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\nfrom .block import Block\nfrom .table import Table\n\n__all__ = ['Block', 'Table']\n```\nThis code simply imports two classes from local modules and declares an `__all__` list for explicit exports. It is a standard pattern for Python package initialization or module exports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward and does not contain any errors, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- **Issues in logic or reasoning:** None. The code performs a typical import and export declaration.\n\n### Scores given in reports:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (correct)\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Risk score (0):** The code is purely for module setup, with no data processing, external data, or dynamic behavior. No reason to assign a higher score.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- **Malware score (0):** The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as executing code dynamically, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a simple module export pattern. No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\nGiven the nature of this code, it is unlikely that any hidden malicious activity exists here. If this is part of a larger package, further review of other modules would be necessary, but based solely on this snippet, no issues are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the reports' assessments, and I agree with their conclusions.",
