  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing HTML, URLs, and textile attributes, including HTML sanitization, URL validation, image size retrieval, and attribute parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, external URLs (for getimagesize), regex matches in parse_attributes.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML tags and attribute strings, URL fetches in getimagesize.",
  "flows": "Regex parsing and string manipulation in parse_attributes, URL fetching in getimagesize, HTML encoding/decoding in decode_high and encode_high.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of regex for HTML parsing is fragile but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions performing benign operations related to HTML and URL processing. Regex-based HTML parsing is known to be fragile but not malicious. The getimagesize function fetches images over the network, which could be misused but is a standard utility pattern. decode_high and encode_high functions handle HTML entities and code points safely. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are consistent with the code's nature. The low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified, mainly due to external URL fetching potential misuse, but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, utility functions with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
