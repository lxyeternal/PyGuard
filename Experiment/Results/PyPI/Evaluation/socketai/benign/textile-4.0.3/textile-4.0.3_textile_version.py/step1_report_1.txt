  "anomalies": "Single static string; no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string assignment. It does not read external inputs, perform any operations, or invoke functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The presence of only a version variable is typical in package configuration or metadata files.",
