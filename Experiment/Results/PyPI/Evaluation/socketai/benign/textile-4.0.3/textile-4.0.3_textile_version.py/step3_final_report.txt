  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the variable VERSION, typically used for package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assigned to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the assignment is static and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple, straightforward assignment with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct assignment of a version string to a variable, with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious activities are present. The code is typical for package versioning and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
