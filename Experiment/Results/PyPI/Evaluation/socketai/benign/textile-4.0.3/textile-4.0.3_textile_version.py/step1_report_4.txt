  "purpose": "Defines the version string of a software package or module.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reads).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or external data writes).",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no source-to-sink operations.",
  "anomalies": "Simple assignment; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable named VERSION. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no potentially dangerous operations or code execution. This is typical in package metadata files or module initializations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, representing a straightforward version assignment with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
