{
  "purpose": "The code defines a TextileFactory class that configures parameters for creating Textile objects, validating inputs and delegating parsing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameter values such as 'lite', 'restricted', 'html_type', and the 'text' argument in process() method.",
  "sinks": "The Textile.parse() method called with 'text' as input, which may process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from process() to Textile.parse() via delegation; configuration parameters are set during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with validation and delegation, no suspicious or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple factory pattern that sets configuration options and delegates parsing to an external Textile class. It performs input validation and does not perform network operations, file I/O, or obfuscation. The main security concern depends on Textile.parse() implementation, which is outside this snippet. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal security risk score reflects that the code only configures and delegates, with potential external risks depending on Textile.parse(). Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
