  "purpose": "Factory class to create and configure Textile objects for processing text with specified settings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the process method, class and method parameters set during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The 'parse' method of the Textile object, which processes input text.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into Textile.parse(), guided by configuration parameters established during TextileFactory initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a TextileFactory class that sets configuration parameters for creating Textile objects. It validates inputs like 'lite', 'restricted', and 'html_type'. The process method delegates text processing to Textile.parse(). No untrusted data sources or malicious behavior are apparent. The code primarily handles configuration and delegation without any network, file, or environment variable operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward factory for Textile objects, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs configuration validation and delegates processing to Textile, which is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, it is a benign component without suspicious behavior.",
