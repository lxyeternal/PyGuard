  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a `TextileFactory` class that configures parameters for creating `Textile` objects.\n- The `process()` method creates a `Textile` instance with the stored configuration and calls its `parse()` method with user-provided text.\n- The code performs validation on input parameters (`lite`, `restricted`, `html_type`) and sets configuration options accordingly.\n- There are no network calls, file operations, environment variable manipulations, or obfuscated/malicious code within this snippet.\n- The security of the overall system heavily depends on the implementation of `Textile.parse()`, which is external to this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues** are present in the code snippet itself.\n- The code is straightforward, with clear validation and delegation, and no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malware detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a factory class)\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms no malicious code, just a configuration factory.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Similar to above, emphasizes that the code is a standard factory, with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (still very low)\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Reiterates that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Notes that the `parse()` method is called with untrusted input, which could be a concern depending on `Textile.parse()`'s implementation.\n- **Analysis:** The code itself does not process or sanitize the input beyond delegation; potential vulnerabilities depend on `Textile.parse()`.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the risk depends on `Textile.parse()`, which is outside this code snippet.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains 0, as no malicious code is present here.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2, reflecting the dependency on external implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, the risk score should be very low, around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting that the actual security concern depends on `Textile.parse()`.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (minimal, contingent on external `Textile.parse()` implementation)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a simple factory with no inherent security issues.\n- The main concern is the external `Textile.parse()` method, which could be a vector if it contains vulnerabilities or malicious code, but that is outside this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk scores assigned are appropriate given the context. No modifications are necessary based on this review.",
