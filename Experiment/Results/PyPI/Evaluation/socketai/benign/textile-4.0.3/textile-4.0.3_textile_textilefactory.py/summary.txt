  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal security risk score reflects that the code only configures and delegates, with potential external risks depending on Textile.parse(). Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use."
