  "purpose": "Factory class for creating and configuring Textile parser instances for processing strings with specified settings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'text' in the process() method.",
  "sinks": "The 'parse' method of the Textile class, which processes the input text.",
  "flows": "The 'text' parameter flows into Textile.parse() via Textile(**self.class_parms).parse(text, **self.method_parms).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a factory class for creating Textile objects with configurable parameters. It performs input validation for 'lite' and 'html_type' parameters, setting configuration dictionaries accordingly. The 'process' method calls the Textile class's parse method with user-defined settings. No external data sources, environment variable use, or insecure operations are present. The code appears to be standard configuration and object creation logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a configuration factory for Textile parsing objects. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation with no security risks.",
