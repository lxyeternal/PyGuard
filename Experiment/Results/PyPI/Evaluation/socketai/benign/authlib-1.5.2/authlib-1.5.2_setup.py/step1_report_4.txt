{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'Authlib' Python package, including dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or user input handling occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as no input processing is performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using standard setup tools without any unusual constructs or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package name and required dependencies. It is a minimal, standard setup script with no embedded malicious logic. The 'install_requires' specifies a dependency on 'cryptography' version 3.2 or higher. There are no obfuscated parts, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical package setup script intended for publishing or installing a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
