  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package named 'Authlib' specifying a dependency on 'cryptography>=3.2'.",
  "sources": "Static import of 'setup' from 'setuptools' and static arguments in 'setup()'. No dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard setup code with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static package setup script with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or network operations. All dependency and metadata declarations are standard. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The dependency 'cryptography>=3.2' is a common cryptographic library with no malicious implications. The comments indicate metadata is stored elsewhere, which is standard practice. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence and reports are consistent, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate.",
