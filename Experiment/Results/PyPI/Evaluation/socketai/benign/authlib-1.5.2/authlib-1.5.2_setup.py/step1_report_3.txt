  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'Authlib' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only specifies static package information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with package name and dependencies. It lacks any dynamic execution, input handling, or suspicious constructs. The dependency 'cryptography>=3.2' is a standard cryptographic library with no malicious behavior associated. The comment indicates standard package metadata placement, with no embedded malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies in a conventional manner.",
