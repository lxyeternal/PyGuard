  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'Authlib' Python package.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function from setuptools, and the 'install_requires' list defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of setup and dependencies is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' to configure package installation. The 'install_requires' specifies a dependency on 'cryptography>=3.2'. All code is standard for packaging, with no signs of malicious intent. No code execution, data collection, or network activity occurs here. The comment indicates metadata is stored elsewhere, which is typical. Overall, the code appears legitimate and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies without any harmful logic.",
