  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the Authlib Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from setuptools import setup' and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and invokes setup() to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies a single dependency on 'cryptography>=3.2'. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing. The comments indicate metadata is maintained elsewhere, which is common practice. Overall, the code appears standard and legitimate for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
