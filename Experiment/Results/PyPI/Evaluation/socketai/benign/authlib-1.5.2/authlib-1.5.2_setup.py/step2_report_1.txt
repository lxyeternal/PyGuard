  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a minimal setup script importing `setup` from `setuptools` and calling it with static metadata and dependencies.\n- The code is straightforward, static, and does not perform any dynamic actions, input/output, or network operations.\n- The dependency specified is `cryptography>=3.2`, a standard cryptographic library with no known malicious behavior.\n- The comments mention that metadata is stored elsewhere, which is common practice and does not raise suspicion.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; no issues or malicious code are present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the script is a typical setup configuration.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are present in the code or the reports.\n\n### Score review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis and are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is static, straightforward, and involves no dynamic or network operations, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- Malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is correct; code is clear and readable.\n- Security risk score of 0 is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements, this is justified.\n- No hidden or malicious behavior is implied or detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are consistent with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence presented.",
