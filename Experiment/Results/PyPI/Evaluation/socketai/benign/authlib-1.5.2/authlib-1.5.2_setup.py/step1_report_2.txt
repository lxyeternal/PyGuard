{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the Authlib package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the setup() function call, the 'install_requires' list, and the import statement from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply specifies dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with static package metadata and dependency information. There are no dynamic or malicious behaviors such as code execution, network access, or data leaks. The dependencies specified are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The comments mention that metadata is stored elsewhere, which is normal practice.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious code present. It simply declares the package name and required dependencies, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
