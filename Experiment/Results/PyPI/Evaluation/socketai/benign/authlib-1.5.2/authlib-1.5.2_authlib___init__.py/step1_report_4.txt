{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports related constants for the authlib library, which implements OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports from the .consts module (author, homepage, version).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only assigns imported constants to module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants from a local module, assigns them to module-level variables, and includes metadata such as version, homepage, author, and license. It contains no user input, external data handling, or executable code that could be malicious. It appears to be standard package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package metadata and import setup with no signs of malicious behavior. It simply sets up some constants and metadata for the authlib library.",
