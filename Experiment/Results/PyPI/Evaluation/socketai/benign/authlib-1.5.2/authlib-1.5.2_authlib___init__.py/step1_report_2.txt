  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports related constants for the authlib library, which is used to build OAuth and OpenID Connect clients and providers.",
  "sources": "Imports constants 'author', 'homepage', and 'version' from the 'consts' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow leading to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns imported constants to module variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants from an internal module and assigns them to module-level variables. It only contains metadata definitions and import statements. No external data input, network activity, or executable code is present. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard module initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata and import setup for the authlib library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
