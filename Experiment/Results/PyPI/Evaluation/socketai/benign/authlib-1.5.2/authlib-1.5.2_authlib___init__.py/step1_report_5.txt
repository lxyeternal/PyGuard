  "sources": "Import statements for constants from the .consts module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only assigns imported constants to module variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata.",
