  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports constants and assigns them to package metadata variables. It contains no functions, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as standard package metadata. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
