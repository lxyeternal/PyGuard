  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a module that imports constants from a local `.consts` module and assigns them to module-level variables for package metadata.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, user input, network activity, or external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or metadata setup file for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and only sets package metadata.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Are there any?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent, and the code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`.  \n  **This is appropriate** since no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`.  \n  **This is appropriate**; the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign `0`.  \n  **This is appropriate**; the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any activity that would warrant a higher risk score. The code is purely static metadata setup.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code only imports internal constants and assigns them to module variables, there is no indication of malicious intent or hidden behavior.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is standard package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **The code is benign and standard.**  \n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent.**  \n- **No changes needed.**\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
