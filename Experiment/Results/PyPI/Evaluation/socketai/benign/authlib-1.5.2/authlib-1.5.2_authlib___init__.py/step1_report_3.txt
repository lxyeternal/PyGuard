  "purpose": "Provide metadata and import constants for the authlib library, which facilitates OAuth and OpenID Connect client and provider implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'author', 'homepage', and 'version' from the local 'consts' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns imported constants to module-level variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports metadata constants from a local module, assigns them to module attributes, and provides package info. There are no functions, user input handling, or network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package metadata initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
