  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports three constants (`author`, `homepage`, `version`) from an internal module `.consts`.\n- It assigns these constants to module-level variables (`__author__`, `__homepage__`, `__version__`).\n- It sets a license string.\n- There are no functions, user inputs, external data handling, or executable code.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for package metadata setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, standard package metadata setup.\n- They mention no suspicious behaviors, no external data, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- The analysis in each is consistent and accurate.\n- The confidence score is 1, and the malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is as described: a straightforward metadata setup. No issues or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores of 0, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores, and given the code's nature, none are warranted.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it include obfuscated or suspicious code. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All claims are supported by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code appears entirely benign and standard for package initialization.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
