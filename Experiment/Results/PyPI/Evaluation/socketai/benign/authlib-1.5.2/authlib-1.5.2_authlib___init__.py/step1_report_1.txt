{
  "purpose": "To provide metadata and import constants for the authlib package related to OAuth and OpenID Connect implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from .consts module: author, homepage, version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only sets module-level metadata variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns imported values to module variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code is simple and standard for module metadata setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants from a local module and assigns them to module-level variables, along with setting a license string. It serves as metadata setup for the package, with no execution of untrusted input or malicious behavior. There are no apparent suspicious actions or obfuscated code. The imports are from internal modules, not external sources. Overall, this appears to be a benign initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
