  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a deprecated wrapper issuing warnings, processing data via `JsonWebKey` methods, with no malicious activity or security issues identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Evaluation:** The low security risk score is reasonable given the code's nature. No issues with malware or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward wrapper functions with deprecation warnings. The security implications depend on the underlying `JsonWebKey` methods.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Evaluation:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior, these scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, wrapper functions with potential processing of untrusted data via `import_key_set` and `import_key`. No network or system modifications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Evaluation:** Slightly higher security risk score reflects that untrusted input could be processed insecurely depending on the underlying implementation. Still, no direct malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly higher risk score is justified; no change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, with no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Evaluation:** Appropriate, given the code's benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are suitable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others—simple deprecation wrappers, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Evaluation:** Completely reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the potential for untrusted data processing. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to processing untrusted data, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**In conclusion, all reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.**",
