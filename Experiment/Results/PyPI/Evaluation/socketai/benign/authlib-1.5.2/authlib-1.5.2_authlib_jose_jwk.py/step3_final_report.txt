  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for importing and exporting JSON Web Keys with deprecation warnings, encouraging direct use of JsonWebKey.",
  "sources": "Input data via 'obj' parameter in loads(), and 'key' parameter in dumps(), processed through JsonWebKey methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential processing of untrusted data in JsonWebKey.import_key_set, find_by_kid, and import_key, which could lead to vulnerabilities if these methods are insecure.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'obj' or 'key' into JsonWebKey methods, with deprecation warnings issued before processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; reliance on external library functions without internal validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward deprecated wrapper around JsonWebKey functions, issuing warnings to guide users towards direct use. It processes external input via imported methods that could be insecure if not properly implemented, but within this snippet, no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, considering the potential risk of untrusted data handling depending on the underlying library. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security issues is present. The deprecation warnings are standard and do not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, deprecated wrapper around cryptographic key functions with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score reflects cautious acknowledgment of untrusted data processing, but no active vulnerabilities are identified. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
