{
  "purpose": "Provides deprecated wrapper functions for loading and dumping JSON Web Keys, encouraging direct use of the JsonWebKey class.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via the 'loads' function parameter 'obj' and 'kid', and via 'dumps' function parameter 'key'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'JsonWebKey.import_key_set' and 'JsonWebKey.import_key' to process data; the output is a dictionary representing a key.",
  "flows": "Input data ('obj' or 'key') flows into 'import_key_set' or 'import_key' methods, which process the data into key objects; the results are returned or converted to dict.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'deprecate' function to indicate outdated methods; no direct use of environment variables, network operations, or code injection mechanisms; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that serve as deprecated wrappers around the 'JsonWebKey' class methods for importing keys. It issues deprecation warnings suggesting direct use of 'JsonWebKey'. The functions process input objects into key instances and convert them into dictionaries. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The deprecation warnings could potentially mislead if the new recommended method is not secure, but in isolation, this code appears benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. It simply wraps existing functionality with a warning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward deprecation wrapper around cryptographic key import/export functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks by itself. It simply encourages users to bypass these deprecated functions in favor of direct usage of 'JsonWebKey'.",
