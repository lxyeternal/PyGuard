{
  "purpose": "This code provides deprecated functions for loading and dumping JSON Web Keys, encouraging direct use of the JsonWebKey class.",
  "sources": "The code reads input objects `obj` and `key` passed to the `loads` and `dumps` functions, respectively.",
  "sinks": "The functions invoke `JsonWebKey.import_key_set`, `JsonWebKey.find_by_kid`, and `JsonWebKey.import_key`, which may process cryptographic key data, but no external sinks like network or file I/O are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow through `loads` to `import_key_set` or `import_key`; output of `import_key` is converted to a dict. No external data sinks or dangerous operations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs deprecated functions and encourages direct class use; no malicious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving deprecation warnings and calls to the JsonWebKey class methods for importing keys. No dynamic code execution, no data leakage, and no suspicious operations are evident. The functions serve as wrappers with deprecation notices. No network, file, or environment variable access occurs. The code does not perform any suspicious behavior or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, deprecated wrapper around cryptographic key import/export functions. It does not contain malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It encourages proper usage of a cryptography library with no evident threats.",
