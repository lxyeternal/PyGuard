{
  "purpose": "This code provides deprecated wrapper functions for handling JSON Web Keys, facilitating the import and export of key data structures.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments 'obj' and 'key', which are used in key import functions.",
  "sinks": "The key import functions may process untrusted data, potentially leading to security issues if input is malicious, but no direct sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (obj, key) is processed through import methods, with deprecation warnings issued. Data flows from input parameters into key import functions, which then produce key objects.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns; deprecation warnings are standard, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a deprecated function and issues warnings to encourage newer practices. It processes input data via the 'JsonWebKey' class methods for importing keys. There are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors; the code simply wraps existing library functions with deprecation notices. No untrusted data flows outside of expected input handling, and no external network or system modifications are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a deprecated wrapper around key handling functions with proper deprecation warnings. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security posture is safe, assuming the 'JsonWebKey' methods are secure. The code's purpose is straightforward, with no suspicious activity.",
