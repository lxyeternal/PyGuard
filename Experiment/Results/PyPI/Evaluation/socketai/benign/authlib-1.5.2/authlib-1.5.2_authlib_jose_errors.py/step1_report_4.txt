{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) operations, such as decoding, signature validation, and claim validation.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; it solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data processing within this code; it only raises exceptions based on provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily consists of class definitions with straightforward constructors and attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of custom exception classes for JOSE-related errors, each with descriptive messages. It uses standard Python class inheritance and exception handling patterns. No external data reading, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are found. Overall, the code appears to serve as a structured way to handle errors rather than execute malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for JOSE error handling, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious, and the structure indicates it is used for clearer error management within a larger JOSE processing library.",
