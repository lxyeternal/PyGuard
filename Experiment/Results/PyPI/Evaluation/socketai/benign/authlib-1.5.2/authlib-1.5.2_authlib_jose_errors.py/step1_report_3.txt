{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) error scenarios in an authlib-based authentication context.",
  "sources": "Import of AuthlibBaseError; instantiation of error objects and custom error classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily defines error classes without data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of error classes may set attributes or generate descriptive messages, but no data flow involving untrusted input is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The class definitions are straightforward and serve as exception structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various error types related to JOSE operations, inheriting from a base error class. There are no functions performing I/O, network communication, or data processing that could be exploited. The constructors mainly set descriptive messages or attributes. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for a security exception handling module, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of custom exception classes used for error handling in JOSE-related operations. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
