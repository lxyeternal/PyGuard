{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) operations within the authlib library.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from authlib.common.errors import AuthlibBaseError'. The code itself does not read external input but relies on errors that may be raised during runtime operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially when exceptions are raised during JOSE processing, especially in error handling and validation workflows. No external sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is evident; the classes are primarily for error categorization. The flow would involve error conditions in JOSE processing raising these exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard Python class inheritance for custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class. Each class encapsulates specific JOSE-related errors, with some constructors accepting parameters to provide detailed error descriptions. There are no external input sources, no data processing, or network interactions within this code. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are detected. The structure is typical for error handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for handling JOSE-related errors within a library. It contains no malicious code, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. The design facilitates clear error reporting during JOSE operations but does not introduce any security risks or malicious intent.",
