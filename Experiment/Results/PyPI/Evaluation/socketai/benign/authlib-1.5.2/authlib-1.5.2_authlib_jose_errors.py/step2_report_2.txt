  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's purpose, structure, and potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class (`AuthlibBaseError`).\n- The classes are specific to JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) error scenarios.\n- The code is straightforward, with constructors mainly setting descriptive messages or attributes.\n- No data processing, input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is purely for error classification, with no malicious behavior or security risks. This matches the code's structure.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that this code is standard exception class definitions. They note the absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward class inheritance without obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk score (general):**  \n  All reports give a risk score of 1, but this appears inconsistent with the content. These are exception class definitions, not active code that could be exploited. The risk should be low, perhaps around 0.0 or 0.1, unless integrated into a broader context that could cause issues.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and does not execute any logic that could be exploited.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n- The code does not handle untrusted input directly; it only defines exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature, **0.1** might be more appropriate than 1, since it's non-executable error definitions. But even 0.1 might be high; I would suggest **0** for the risk score.\n\n### Overall:\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for error handling in a JOSE context. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, serving as structured error handling.\n- The risk and malware scores should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score is **0**.\n- The overall risk score should be **0** or very close to it.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nUpdate the scores to reflect the code's benign nature, setting malware, obfuscated, and risk scores to **0**.",
