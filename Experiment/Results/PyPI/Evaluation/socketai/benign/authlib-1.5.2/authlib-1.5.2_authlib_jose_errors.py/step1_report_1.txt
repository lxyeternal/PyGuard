  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) operations in the authlib library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from authlib.common.errors and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input directly or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class inheritance for error handling with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behavior, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "This code strictly defines custom exception classes to categorize and handle errors during JOSE processing. All classes inherit from a common base error class. Constructors only set descriptive messages and attributes. There are no code execution, network calls, or input handling that could be exploited. No secrets or hardcoded credentials are present. The structure is clean, and the purpose is to facilitate error handling, not to execute any logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for error classification within the authlib library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions that could compromise security or leak data.",
