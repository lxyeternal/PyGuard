{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for JOSE error handling within the authlib library, categorizing various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions setting error messages and attributes; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; purely class attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or execution beyond class instantiation for error categorization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a base error class, setting descriptive error messages. It does not process input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The purpose is to categorize errors, not to execute logic or handle untrusted data. The code is standard for error handling modules, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a structured set of error classes for JOSE operations. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
