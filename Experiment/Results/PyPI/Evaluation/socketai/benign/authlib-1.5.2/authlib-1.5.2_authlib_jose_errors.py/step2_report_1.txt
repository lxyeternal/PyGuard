  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to JOSE operations.\n- All classes inherit from a common base, `AuthlibBaseError`.\n- Constructors mainly set descriptive messages or attributes.\n- No data processing, network calls, or input handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to categorize errors for better error handling, not to execute logic or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; defines custom exceptions.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n**Verdict:** Fully aligned, reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning confirming no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusions; the code is straightforward error class definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the absence of data flow, external I/O, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n**Verdict:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same reasoning; the code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** No, the code is just class definitions.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero, no malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** None, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could be exploited.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports correctly assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is purely for error classification within a security library, with no malicious or obfuscating elements. The current scoring is justified and should remain as is.",
