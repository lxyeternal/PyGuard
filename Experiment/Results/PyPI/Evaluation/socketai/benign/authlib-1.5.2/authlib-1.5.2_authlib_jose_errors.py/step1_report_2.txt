{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various errors related to JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) operations within the authlib library.",
  "sources": "Import of AuthlibBaseError from authlib.common.errors; class definitions and constructors that set error attributes and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Error handling flow through exception raising; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiations with specific messages based on error conditions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. All classes are standard error definitions with no code execution or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class. Each class sets specific error codes and messages for different JOSE error scenarios. No input handling, network operations, or data processing occurs. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code logic. The structure is straightforward and intended for error management within a larger security-focused library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom error classes for JOSE-related errors, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks detected. It does not process or handle untrusted data directly and appears safe.",
