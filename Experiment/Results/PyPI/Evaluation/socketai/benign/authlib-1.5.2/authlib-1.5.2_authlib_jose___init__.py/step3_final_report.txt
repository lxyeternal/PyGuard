  "purpose": "Setup and registration of JOSE cryptographic components, algorithms, and key classes within the Authlib library.",
  "sources": "Static imports, registration functions, class attribute assignments, and module exports.",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted input, external data, or network operations.",
  "flows": "Initialization and registration of cryptographic algorithms and key classes; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static registration and configuration of cryptographic components, with no dynamic execution, data processing, or external interactions. All operations are straightforward and standard for a cryptography library setup. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard setup module for cryptographic algorithms and key classes, and the scores should reflect that. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0; the risk score can be 0 or very close to 0 (e.g., 0.1) to acknowledge minimal inherent risk in cryptographic configuration.",
