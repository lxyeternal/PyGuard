  "purpose": "Functions for decoding JWT segments and extracting headers, ensuring proper validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Base64 URL-safe decoding of segments, JSON parsing of decoded data.",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not write to external systems or leak data.",
  "flows": "Input segments -> urlsafe_b64decode -> json_loads -> validated header/dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward decoding and validation routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT segment decoding with proper error handling, no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It processes untrusted input but does not perform any network operations, file access, or execute malicious payloads. The functions are clear, well-structured, and align with typical JWT processing routines. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure JWT decoding utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the context of processing untrusted data, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected.",
