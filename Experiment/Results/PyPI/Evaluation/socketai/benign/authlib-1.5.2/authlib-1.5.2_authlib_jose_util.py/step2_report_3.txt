  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Decodes JWT header/payload segments, proper error handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code performs standard decoding and JSON parsing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- Error handling is appropriate.\n- The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, given the code processes untrusted input but is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for decoding segments, standard JWT processing, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Functions are straightforward, with proper exception handling.\n- No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- The risk score of 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, decoding segments, standard processing, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Same reasoning as previous reports.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Decoding and validating token segments, standard routines, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code, no backdoors.\n- Proper error handling.\n- Risk score aligns with standard decoding routines.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** JWT decoding routines, no malicious behavior, standard validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Data flows are limited to decoding and validation.\n- Risk score is suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward decoding functions. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the fact that these functions process untrusted input but are standard in token decoding routines.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard, well-understood operations for decoding JWT segments.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- Error handling is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are reasonable, given the context of decoding untrusted data, but do not indicate any active security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — standard decoding routines handling untrusted input, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The risk scores could be slightly lower, but given the context, they are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the code's functionality. No adjustments necessary.",
