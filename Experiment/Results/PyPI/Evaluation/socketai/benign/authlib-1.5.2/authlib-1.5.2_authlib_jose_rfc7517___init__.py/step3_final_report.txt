{
  "purpose": "This module provides an implementation of JSON Web Key (JWK) as per RFC 7517, serving as a structural component for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: _cryptography_key, asymmetric_key, base_key, jwk, key_set",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports and exports classes/functions",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely static import/export setup",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no dynamic code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module header with descriptive comments and import statements. It does not process data, execute logic, or perform network operations. The imported modules are not shown, but their inclusion does not imply malicious intent. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no security issues or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, structural setup for a cryptographic library component implementing JWK. All signals point to a safe, standard module with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
