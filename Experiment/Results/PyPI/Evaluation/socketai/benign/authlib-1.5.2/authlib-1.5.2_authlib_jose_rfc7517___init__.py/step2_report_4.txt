  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a simple module header with import statements, no data processing, or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the benign nature of the code, purely import/export setup.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a straightforward module initialization with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard module setup, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, with a slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). Given the code is just imports and documentation, this seems overly cautious.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 — perhaps slightly inflated.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; the securityRisk score could be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely structural, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The imports are from internal modules, but their content isn't shown; however, based on this snippet alone, there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The slightly elevated securityRisk in report 5 is unwarranted; I recommend lowering it to 0.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is a standard, safe module declaration for a cryptographic library.",
