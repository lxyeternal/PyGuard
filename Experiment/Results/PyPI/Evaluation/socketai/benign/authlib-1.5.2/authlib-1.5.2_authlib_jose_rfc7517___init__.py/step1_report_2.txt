{
  "purpose": "This module provides an implementation of JSON Web Key (JWK) according to RFC 7517, including imports of cryptographic and key management classes.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from internal modules: ._cryptography_key, .asymmetric_key, .base_key, .jwk, and .key_set.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; potential vulnerabilities could originate if imported modules perform unsafe operations or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "This snippet does not execute data flows; it only imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and metadata declaration for a JWK implementation. It imports several classes and functions from internal modules, likely used for cryptographic key operations. There is no input handling, data processing, or network activity present. The structure appears standard and adheres to common Python module practices. Since the code solely imports and declares exports, it does not perform any operations that could be malicious. The security implications depend entirely on the imported modules, which are not shown here. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that declares the implementation of JSON Web Key (JWK) functionality. It performs standard imports and exposes certain classes and functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
