  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Static package metadata variables (`name`, `version`, `author`, `homepage`)\n- A formatted string `default_user_agent` combining these variables\n- A list `default_json_headers` with standard HTTP headers\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- All data is hardcoded and static\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution\n- No obfuscated code, secrets, or credentials\n- The purpose appears to be configuration setup for an open-source library\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration data with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No, all reports consistently conclude benign intent, which aligns with the code.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is reasonable.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what the code shows.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\nGiven the static, straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the assessments provided. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard static configuration snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and thorough.",
