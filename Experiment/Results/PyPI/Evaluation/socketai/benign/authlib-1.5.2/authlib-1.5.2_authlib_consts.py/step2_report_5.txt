  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The original code consists solely of static variable assignments: package metadata and HTTP headers.\n   - No dynamic code, user input, external data, or executable logic is present.\n   - The `default_user_agent` is a formatted string combining static variables; no user input or external data involved.\n   - The `default_json_headers` is a static list of tuples.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and standard for configuration purposes.\n   - No report mentions any hidden or obfuscated code, nor do they suggest any malicious intent.\n   - The assessments are consistent: no anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no code injection, and no secrets.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malware**:\n   - Since there's no dynamic behavior, no external data, and no obfuscation, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The code is purely static configuration data; thus, the security risk is minimal.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is straightforward, static configuration data with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nMaintain the current scores. No changes are necessary.",
