  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes static variables for package information and defines a list of standard JSON headers. All data is hardcoded, static, and intended for configuration or setup purposes. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no dynamic execution or code injection mechanisms. The code appears to serve as metadata and configuration setup without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, contains static package information and standard headers, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
