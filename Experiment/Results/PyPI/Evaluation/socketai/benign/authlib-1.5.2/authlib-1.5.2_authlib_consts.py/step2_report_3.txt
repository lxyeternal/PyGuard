  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe static variable assignments for package metadata and default HTTP headers.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or external data sources are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be straightforward configuration data.\n\n**Analysis of Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the static, clear code.\n- Security risk scores are 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The only possible concern could be the use of formatted strings for `default_user_agent`. However, since it only combines static constants, it does not introduce any security issues.\n- No report suggests any actual vulnerability, data leakage, or malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem appropriate and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided code and analysis.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is purely static configuration data.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The risk scores should remain at 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses and the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent with the code's benign, static nature. No modifications to scores are needed.",
