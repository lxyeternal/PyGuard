  "purpose": "Define package metadata and default HTTP headers for the Authlib library.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string variables, formatted string creation for 'default_user_agent', and list of header tuples.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or output based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "None; code only assigns static values without processing external input or performing actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code uses static, hardcoded values with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up package metadata variables and a list of default HTTP headers with static values. The 'default_user_agent' is constructed using formatted string syntax, but it only combines predefined constants. There are no data reads from external sources, no user inputs, nor any dynamic code execution. The headers are standard for JSON content and cache control, with no signs of malicious content. Overall, this code appears to be straightforward configuration data with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup for package metadata and default headers, containing no malicious behavior or security issues.",
