  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for package metadata and default HTTP headers used in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variables: 'name', 'version', 'author', 'homepage'; formatted string 'default_user_agent'; static list 'default_json_headers'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no dynamic data flow; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable definitions and a list of headers. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution occurs. The 'default_user_agent' is a static string constructed from constants, and headers are predefined. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The malware score, obfuscated score, and security risk score are all appropriately set to 0, reflecting the benign and straightforward configuration purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
