  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe static, hardcoded package metadata and default HTTP headers.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or external data processing is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches the descriptions: static variable assignments, straightforward string formatting, and header definitions.\n- No issues such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- The code is typical for package setup/configuration.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- Since the code is static configuration, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low.\n- The only point to consider is whether the `default_user_agent` could be exploited if used improperly, but as it only contains static data, this is unlikely.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports — justified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 in all reports — justified.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No evidence suggests any higher risk or malicious intent.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimate:\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the current scoring:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This code is benign static configuration data with no security concerns.**",
