  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments defining metadata and headers. The default_user_agent is constructed using a static format string with no user input. The headers are static tuples. There are no input reading, network calls, or data processing routines. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static configuration data with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
