  "purpose": "This code defines a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue deprecation warnings with optional additional information.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only uses function parameters and internal warnings module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no outputs that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely issues warnings based on internal parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for deprecation warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class inheriting from DeprecationWarning, then sets the warnings filter to always display this warning type. The deprecate function constructs a message that may include version and link information, then issues a warning with the custom warning class. There are no external data inputs, no complex logic, or suspicious operations. It is standard warning handling code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling deprecation warnings with optional metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
