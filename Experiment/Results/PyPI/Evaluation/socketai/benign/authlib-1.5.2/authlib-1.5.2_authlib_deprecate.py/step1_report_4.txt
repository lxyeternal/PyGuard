{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue deprecation warnings with additional information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameters `message`, `version`, `link_uid`, and `link_file` within the `deprecate` function.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function acts as a sink, issuing warnings based on the input data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, version, link_uid, link_file) are combined and passed to warnings.warn(), which then outputs the warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard warnings library features. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class `AuthlibDeprecationWarning` inheriting from DeprecationWarning. It sets the warning filter to always display this warning type. The `deprecate` function constructs a message that can include a version and a link, then issues a warning with this message. All operations involve standard warning mechanisms and string manipulations. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flow. The code appears to be intended for notifying users about deprecated features in a package or application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of deprecation warnings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply enhances user notifications about deprecated features and version compatibility.",
