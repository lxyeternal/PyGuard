{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue deprecation warnings with optional version and link details.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data or input; only uses function parameters and warnings module.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function outputs warnings, but this is a standard Python behavior for deprecation notices.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to deprecate() (message, version, link_uid, link_file) are used to construct a warning message, which is then issued via warnings.warn().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior present. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class, sets the warning filter to always show this warning, and provides a function to generate detailed deprecation warnings, optionally including version and link info. It uses standard Python warning mechanisms without external data sources or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for deprecation warnings, and contains no malicious or security-risky behavior. It is a normal utility code for deprecation notices.",
