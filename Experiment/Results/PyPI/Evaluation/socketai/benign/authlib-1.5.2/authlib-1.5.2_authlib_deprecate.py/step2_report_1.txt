  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same code: a simple utility that defines a custom deprecation warning class, sets the warning filter to always display this warning, and provides a function `deprecate()` to generate warnings with optional version and link info.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks.\n- The sources, sinks, and data flows are all typical for such utility code.\n- No external inputs, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious operations are present.\n- The malware score is consistently zero across all reports.\n\n**Confirming the code's behavior:**\n- The code does not read external input beyond function parameters.\n- It issues warnings via Python's `warnings.warn()`, which is standard.\n- The custom warning class inherits from `DeprecationWarning`.\n- The `warnings.simplefilter(\"always\", AuthlibDeprecationWarning)` ensures all such warnings are always shown.\n- The message construction is straightforward string concatenation with optional info.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No signs of data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- No external data sources or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- The warnings are purely informational.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.0), which aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Any discrepancies?**\n- The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign utility for deprecation warnings.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk is negligible, with a score of 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a typical implementation for issuing deprecation warnings, with no malicious or security concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
