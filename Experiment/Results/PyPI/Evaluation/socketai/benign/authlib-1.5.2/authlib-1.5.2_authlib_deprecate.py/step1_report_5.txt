{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom warning class and a function to issue deprecation warnings with optional links for more information.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from the parameters passed to the deprecate() function, such as message, version, link_uid, and link_file.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function is a sink where the warning message is issued; this can potentially be seen by users or logging systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the message construction, which then flows into warnings.warn() to notify users.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard warnings mechanism. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a custom warning class, adjusts warning filters to always display these warnings, and defines a function to generate deprecation warnings with optional detailed links. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The use of warnings is standard for deprecation notices, with no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation for issuing deprecation warnings with optional version and link details. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
