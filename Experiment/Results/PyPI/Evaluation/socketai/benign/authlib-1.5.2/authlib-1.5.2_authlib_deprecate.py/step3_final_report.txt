{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom deprecation warning class, sets the warning filter to always display this warning, and provides a function 'deprecate()' to issue warnings with optional version and link information.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'message', 'version', 'link_uid', 'link_file'; internal warnings module.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() outputs warnings to standard error; no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to construct warning messages, which are then emitted via warnings.warn().",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class inheriting from DeprecationWarning, sets the filter to always show such warnings, and provides a function to generate warnings with optional version and link info. It uses standard Python warnings mechanisms without external data, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to typical warning practices. No security vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation are present. The logic is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for issuing deprecation warnings. It contains no malicious or security-risk behavior, no obfuscation, and no anomalies. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
