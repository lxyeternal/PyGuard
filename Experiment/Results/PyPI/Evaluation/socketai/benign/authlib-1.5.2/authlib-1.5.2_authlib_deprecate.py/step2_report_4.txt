  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard implementation of deprecation warnings. The code defines a custom warning class, sets the warning filter to always display this warning, and provides a function to generate warnings with optional version and link info. No external data inputs, no complex logic, and no suspicious behavior are present.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard. They do not overlook any subtle issues, such as potential misuse of warnings or overlooked security implications. The reasoning appears sound, and the logic is consistent with typical warning mechanisms.  \n   **Conclusion**: No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security risk: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   **Suggestion**: No score adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for issuing warnings and contains no malicious or security-compromising operations, higher risk scores are unjustified.  \n   **Conclusion**: The scores are justified as is.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The malware score of 0 is correct.  \n   **Note**: The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n   **Conclusion**: No unwarranted assumptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a standard utility for deprecation warnings, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no security issues. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
