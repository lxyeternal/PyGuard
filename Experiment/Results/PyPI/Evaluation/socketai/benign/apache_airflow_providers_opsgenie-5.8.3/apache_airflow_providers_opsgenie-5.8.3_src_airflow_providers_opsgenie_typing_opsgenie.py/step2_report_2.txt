  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely a type definition for an alert payload schema.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or I/O operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is static, intended for type checking and documentation purposes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports standard and third-party typing modules, then defines a `TypedDict` class with various optional and required fields.\n- The reports correctly identify that the schema could accept untrusted data, but the schema itself does not process or execute data.\n- The overall security assessment in all reports is that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-documented code.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis that there are no vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The only consideration is that the schema could be used downstream with untrusted data, but this is standard for data schemas and does not constitute a security risk in itself.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a benign, standard type schema with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
