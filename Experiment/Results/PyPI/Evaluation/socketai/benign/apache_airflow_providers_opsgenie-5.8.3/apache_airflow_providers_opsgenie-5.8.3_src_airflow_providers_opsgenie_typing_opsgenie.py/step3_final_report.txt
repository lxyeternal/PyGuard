{
  "purpose": "Defines the schema for creating an Opsgenie alert payload using Python's TypedDict, serving as a data contract for validation and documentation.",
  "sources": "No runtime data sources; the code imports type annotations and defines a class with static fields.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is declarative and does not execute data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type schema for alert payloads, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. It imports standard typing modules and defines a class with optional and required fields. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, intended for type checking and documentation. Given its static nature, it poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema definition with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. All scores are appropriately set to zero, reflecting its safe and static nature.",
