  "purpose": "Defines a typed dictionary schema for creating an Opsgenie alert payload.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; only type annotations and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; this code does not process or execute external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely a static type schema definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a type definition class for a structured payload used in alert creation. It uses Python's TypedDict and type annotations to specify the schema. There are no dynamic data inputs, no code execution, and no external network or file operations. All imports are standard and for type hinting, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign schema definition for alert data, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.",
