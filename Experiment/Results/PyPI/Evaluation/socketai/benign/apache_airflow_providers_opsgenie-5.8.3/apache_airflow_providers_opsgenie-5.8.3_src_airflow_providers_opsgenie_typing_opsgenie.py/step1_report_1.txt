{
  "purpose": "Define a data schema for creating Opsgenie alerts using TypedDict, specifying various alert parameters and their optionality.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; the code defines a data structure and imports type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; purely type definition without runtime execution or data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow, input handling, or untrusted data processing occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is purely declarative for type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations and typing extensions, then defines a TypedDict class for alert payload schema. It specifies alert fields with types and optionality. No functions, I/O operations, or data manipulations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definition for alert payloads with no signs of malicious intent, no data leaks, or security concerns. It serves as a schema for input validation or documentation purposes only.",
