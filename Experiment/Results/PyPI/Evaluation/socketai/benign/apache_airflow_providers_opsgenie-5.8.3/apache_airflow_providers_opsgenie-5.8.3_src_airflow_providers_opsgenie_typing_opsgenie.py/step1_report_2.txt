{
  "purpose": "Defines a data schema for creating Opsgenie alerts using TypedDict with detailed parameters for alert customization.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; the code only defines a data structure schema without input/output operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data handling, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing since the code only declares a class schema.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward schema definition with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party type hinting modules, then defines a TypedDict subclass for alert payloads with various optional and required fields. It contains no executable code, no input/output handling, and no external network or file operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The focus is purely on data structure definition for API payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-documented schema definition for alert data, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for data validation.",
