  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward schema definition using Python's TypedDict, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The code is purely declarative, intended for type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a static type schema with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports\n\n- **Any errors or flawed reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and serves as a data schema. Their reasoning aligns with the code's static, declarative nature.\n\n### Scores review\n\n- **Confidence scores:** All are at 1 or 1.0, which is appropriate given the clear nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0, correct.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Risk justification\n\n- **Why is the risk score 0?**  \n  Because the code is purely declarative, with no data processing, no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### Malware score considerations\n\n- **Is the malware score accurate?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly assign malware = 0, since there's no malicious behavior.\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities\n\n- The reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities, as the code only defines a data schema.\n\n### Consistency of scores with the report\n\n- The scores align well with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment\n\n**Based on the above:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\n- The code is a well-structured, standard type definition for API payloads.\n- No modifications needed; the analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.** The code is a benign schema definition with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or risk.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
