{
  "purpose": "Defines a data schema for creating an Opsgenie alert using TypedDict in Python.",
  "sources": "User or external input can provide data for the fields in CreateAlertPayload, particularly through the parameters such as message, alias, description, responders, etc.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data can be passed into this schema, which could then be used downstream in alert creation processes, but the schema itself does not process or execute data.",
  "flows": "External input flows into the data fields defined in CreateAlertPayload; these fields are then used to construct alerts, but there is no explicit processing or transformation within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly defines a data structure with no executable logic or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing extensions and defines a TypedDict class with various optional and required fields for alert payloads. The docstrings clarify intent, and no functions or runtime logic are present. No indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is purely structural and meant for type checking or validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type definition for alert payloads and contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves as a data schema, with no processing or dynamic execution involved.",
