  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static type definition using Python's TypedDict for an alert payload schema.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or I/O operations.\n- All imports are standard or from well-known typing extensions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a data contract or validation schema.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is a straightforward schema definition.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Logical flaws:** The reports are consistent; they correctly identify that the code is a static schema with no runtime or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n\n- The **malware score** is correctly set to 0 in all reports; no change needed.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly 0; no change needed.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, which is appropriate because the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- Since the code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- All reports agree on this, and I concur.\n\n### Potential assumptions and vulnerabilities:\n\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made in the reports; they correctly state that the code is safe.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis. The code is benign and serves as a data schema.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a simple, static type schema with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scoring reflects this correctly. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, schema-only code snippet with no security concerns.",
