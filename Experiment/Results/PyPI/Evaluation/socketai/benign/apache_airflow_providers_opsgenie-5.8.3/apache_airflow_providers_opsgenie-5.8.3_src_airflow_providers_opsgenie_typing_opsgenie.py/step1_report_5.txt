{
  "purpose": "Define a data schema for creating Opsgenie alerts using TypedDict in Python.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code defines data structure and documentation strings, no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only defines a class schema without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code is purely a type definition with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of a TypedDict class to structure alert payload data. It uses standard Python typing features and includes detailed docstrings. There are no signs of data handling, input/output operations, or runtime execution that could lead to malicious behavior. No suspicious imports or code patterns are detected. The code is static and mainly serves as a data contract.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign data schema definition with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as a type-safe data structure for alert creation, with no active code or external interactions.",
