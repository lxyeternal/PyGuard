  "flows": "N/A, no data or control flow present",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only licensing comments with no executable code or suspicious constructs; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely a licensing comment header, typically included at the top of source files. It contains licensing terms and legal notices, but no code logic, data handling, or executable instructions. Since there is no code, no sources, sinks, or flows are present. This is a standard license header, common in open-source projects, and does not contain any malicious behavior or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a licensing comment header with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security risk or malicious intent. It is a standard legal header in open-source code files.",
