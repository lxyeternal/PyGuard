{
  "purpose": "Provides static package metadata information such as versions, integrations, dependencies, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the get_provider_info() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; static data is returned directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the function to any caller; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning a fixed dictionary with package info. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is typical for package metadata files, with standard licensing headers and comments. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score is slightly above zero in one report (0.1), but given the static, read-only nature, it should be 0. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata provider with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; the only adjustment needed is setting the security risk score to 0 in the report that assigned 0.1, to reflect the code's safe nature.",
