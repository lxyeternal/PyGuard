{
  "purpose": "The code provides metadata and configuration information for the 'apache-airflow-providers-opsgenie' package, including version history, integration details, operators, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The data is static and hardcoded within the get_provider_info() function; no external data input or dynamic data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involve untrusted input or external data flows; the code does not process or transmit data beyond returning a static dictionary.",
  "flows": "The function returns a predefined dictionary; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward static configuration with no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no hidden or suspicious behavior. It includes standard licensing headers and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static function returning package metadata, including version info, integration details, dependencies, and related documentation. There are no dynamic data inputs, external data processing, or network activities. The content appears to be auto-generated documentation or configuration data, with standard licensing notices and no indications of malicious behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static metadata function with no malicious intent. It simply returns predefined package information. No security risks or malware signals are detected. The code is consistent with normal package metadata scripts.",
