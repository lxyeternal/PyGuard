  "purpose": "This code defines a function that returns metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-opsgenie' package, including version info, integrations, operators, hooks, dependencies, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() is a source that provides package metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output based on external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code is static and solely returns predefined data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard static data structure with no obfuscated or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static Python function returning a dictionary with package metadata. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The comments indicate the file is auto-generated and overwrites may occur, but no malicious behavior is evident. No anomalies, suspicious code, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, auto-generated metadata provider for a Python package. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code is standard and safe for use.",
