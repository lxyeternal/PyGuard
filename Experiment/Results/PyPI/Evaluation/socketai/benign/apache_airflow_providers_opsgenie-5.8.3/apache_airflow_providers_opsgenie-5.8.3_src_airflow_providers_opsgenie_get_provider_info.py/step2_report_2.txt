  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — all appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes static, non-malicious nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is static metadata with no dynamic or malicious content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the securityRisk score is slightly above zero.\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** Given the code's static nature, this seems overly cautious. No actual vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be 0, aligning with the other reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; static, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is static and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static, auto-generated, and benign.\n- The only inconsistency is Report 3's securityRisk score of 0.1, which is unjustified given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward static metadata provider.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores should uniformly reflect this.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the nature of the code and the detailed analysis above.",
