  "purpose": "Performs a version check to ensure the Apache Airflow environment meets the minimum required version (2.9.0).",
  "sources": "Reads airflow.__version__ to determine current version.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0, halting execution.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow.__version__, parses and compares it, then raises exception if incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard version validation logic with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the current Airflow version, parses it using packaging.version, compares it against a hardcoded minimum version, and raises an exception if the environment does not meet the requirement. The logic is straightforward, transparent, and typical for dependency validation. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The exception message is controlled and informative. The version string is hardcoded but standard practice. The overall structure is simple and secure.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard, benign environment validation check for version compatibility. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The purpose is legitimate, and the implementation is appropriate.",
