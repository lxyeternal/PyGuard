  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Version compatibility check for an Airflow provider package.\n- Findings: Reads airflow version, compares, raises RuntimeError if incompatible.\n- Anomalies: None detected; standard code.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, benign code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Defines version validation and licensing info.\n- Findings: Reads version, compares, raises error if outdated.\n- Anomalies: None; standard pattern.\n- Analysis: Typical package validation code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Part of auto-generated provider module.\n- Findings: Version check, raises exception if incompatible.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior; standard validation.\n- Analysis: Straightforward comparison, no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Benign validation script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly elevated risk score, but since the code is benign, this seems high; the risk score should likely be 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Sets metadata and version requirements.\n- Findings: Reads version, raises exception if incompatible.\n- Anomalies: None; standard validation.\n- Analysis: Typical dependency check.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Manages version compatibility.\n- Findings: Reads version, compares, raises error if incompatible.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard version check.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs straightforward version validation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity are present.\n- The only point of contention is Report 3's securityRisk score of 0.1, which seems unwarranted given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as the code performs standard validation without any security implications.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, safe version validation snippet with no security issues.",
