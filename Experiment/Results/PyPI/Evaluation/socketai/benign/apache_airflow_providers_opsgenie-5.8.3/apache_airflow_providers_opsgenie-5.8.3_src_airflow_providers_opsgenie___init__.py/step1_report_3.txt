{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of an automatically generated provider module for Apache Airflow, used for version validation and module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an import from airflow and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the version condition is not met; no other sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The version check source (airflow.__version__) flows into a comparison and potentially triggers an exception if the version is below 2.9.0.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code includes standard import and version validation logic. The version string appears hardcoded but is typical for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version parsing modules and retrieves the current airflow version. It then compares the base version to a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the current version is lower, it raises an exception, enforcing version compatibility. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. There are no dynamic code execution, secret handling, or network interactions. It performs a simple validation and export operation, typical in Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated validation script for ensuring compatibility with a certain Airflow version. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is clear and typical for such modules.",
