{
  "purpose": "This code defines version validation and licensing information for a Python package related to Apache Airflow providers.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the imported __version__ attribute and the packaging library for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which affects package compatibility.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow version, parses it, compares it to a minimum required version, and raises an exception if outdated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard version check and licensing comments. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets a version string, compares the current Airflow version against a minimum requirement, and raises an error if the version is too low. The comments indicate licensing and automated code generation. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities are present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with typical package validation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check and licensing header for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
