{
  "purpose": "This code manages version compatibility and licensing information for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring it runs with supported Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported airflow.__version__ variable and a hardcoded __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a control flow action based on untrusted version data.",
  "flows": "The airflow_version source flows into the packaging.version.parse comparison, which then leads to a RuntimeError sink if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The version comparison logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version parsing library and retrieves the current Airflow version. It compares this with a minimum supported version (2.9.0). If the installed Airflow version is lower, it raises an exception. The __version__ variable is set statically. No untrusted data is processed besides the version string, and the logic is simple version comparison. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code. The code is standard for dependency/version compatibility checks.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a basic, legitimate check on the environment to ensure compatibility, with no evidence of malicious intent. It simply enforces version requirements.",
