{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and verifies the version compatibility of an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring it is used with a compatible version of Airflow.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via an import statement from the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is incompatible, which is a controlled exception handling flow.",
  "flows": "The version parsing and comparison flow occurs from reading the airflow version to raising an exception if the version condition is not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard version comparison and exception raising. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward check on the airflow version, raising an exception if it is below 2.9.0. The version string is obtained from the airflow module, parsed, and compared using the packaging library. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be standard version validation logic commonly used in package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version compatibility check without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and its purpose is legitimate.",
