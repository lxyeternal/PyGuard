{
  "purpose": "This code sets metadata and version requirements for an Apache Airflow provider package, enforcing minimum Airflow version constraints.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the 'airflow' module (__version__), and a hardcoded version string (__version__).",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, potentially stopping execution but not performing malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads airflow.__version__, compares it with a hardcoded string, and raises an exception if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; the code appears to perform version validation with standard library and package imports. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and reads version information to validate that the installed Airflow version meets a minimum requirement. It uses standard package parsing and version comparison. The code structure is straightforward and contains no dynamic code execution or external data handling beyond version checking. The only control flow involves raising an exception based on version validation, which is typical for dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version validation for an Airflow provider package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code segments. Overall, the code appears benign and solely focused on ensuring correct environment setup.",
