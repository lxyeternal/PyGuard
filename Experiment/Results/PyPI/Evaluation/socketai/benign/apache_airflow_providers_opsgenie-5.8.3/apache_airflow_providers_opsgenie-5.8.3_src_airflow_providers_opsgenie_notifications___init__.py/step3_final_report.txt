  "analysis": "The code is purely licensing comments with no executable or dynamic content. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. All reports correctly identify the absence of security concerns, and no further action is necessary.",
