  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-greengrass package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static strings defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs detected; setup configuration is static and predetermined.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; all data is static or read from a file during setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code uses standard setup procedures with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setup from setuptools, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. All data is static or file-based, with no user input or untrusted data involved. No dynamic execution, code injection, or obfuscated patterns are present. The dependencies are straightforward, and URLs point to legitimate sources. The code appears to be a typical setup script without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
