  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a standard Python setup script that reads a README.md file and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No dynamic or external data is processed beyond reading a local file.\n- No user input, environment variables (except for the conditional dependency), network operations, or code execution are involved.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; reads README.md, no external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; reads README.md, uses `setuptools`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- Same as above, consistent with previous analyses.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- Same consistent reasoning applies.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- Also consistent; describes a typical setup script with static data.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Review:** The code is a standard, static setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- The only dynamic aspect is the conditional dependency on Python version, which is a common and safe pattern.\n- No signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, network activity, or secret handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe current scores are justified and align with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is a benign, standard package setup script. No changes to the scores or analysis are necessary.",
