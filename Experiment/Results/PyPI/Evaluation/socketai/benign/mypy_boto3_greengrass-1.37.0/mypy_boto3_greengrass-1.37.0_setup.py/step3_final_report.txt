{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-greengrass', defining metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the local README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata, URLs, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes static data to setuptools.setup() -> completes package configuration without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging practices. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports 'setuptools', reads a local README.md for description, and calls setup() with static metadata. It does not execute dynamic code, perform network operations, or handle untrusted input. The dependency on 'typing-extensions' is conditional based on Python version, which is a common pattern. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. All signals indicate a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All provided reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for distribution.",
