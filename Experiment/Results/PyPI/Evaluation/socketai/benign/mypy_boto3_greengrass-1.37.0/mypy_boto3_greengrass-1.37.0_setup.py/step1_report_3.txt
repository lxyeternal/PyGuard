  "purpose": "The script sets up and installs the 'mypy-boto3-greengrass' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads package data from the filesystem, and loads dependencies for installation.",
  "sinks": "None of the data handling involves untrusted sources or user input. The setup function does not execute external commands or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code reads static files (README.md) and defines package metadata and dependencies without any external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. All file reads and dependencies are standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file for description and specifies package details, dependencies, and metadata. No external input, command execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard package configuration script for distribution purposes.",
