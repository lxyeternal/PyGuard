{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-greengrass', aimed at defining package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools, and reading environment variables for Python version in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to security-sensitive sinks like network, file system modification, or execution of external commands.",
  "flows": "The script reads files and environment variables, and passes data into setup() parameters, but no untrusted or external data is used in a way that affects system security.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads the README.md for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs. The 'install_requires' conditionally includes 'typing-extensions' based on Python version, which is typical and safe. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves only to define package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
