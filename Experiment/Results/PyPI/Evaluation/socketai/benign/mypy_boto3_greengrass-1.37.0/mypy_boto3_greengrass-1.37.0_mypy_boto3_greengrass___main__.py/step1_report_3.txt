  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package that provides informational output about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) to determine whether to print version information.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version() which outputs version info. Otherwise, calls print_info() which outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code only prints static information and reads command-line arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and executes based on command-line arguments. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of sensitive data. The control flow is simple, with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed to display package information. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are present.",
