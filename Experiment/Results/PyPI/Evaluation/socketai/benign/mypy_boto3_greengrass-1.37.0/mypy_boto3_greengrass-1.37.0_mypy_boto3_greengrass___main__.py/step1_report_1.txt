  "purpose": "CLI utility to display package information and version details for a specific Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, and outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward CLI logic with functions to print static package info and version. It reads command-line arguments to determine output but does not process or execute untrusted input beyond simple argument checking. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears benign, serving a documentation or informational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It only outputs static information based on user input. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
