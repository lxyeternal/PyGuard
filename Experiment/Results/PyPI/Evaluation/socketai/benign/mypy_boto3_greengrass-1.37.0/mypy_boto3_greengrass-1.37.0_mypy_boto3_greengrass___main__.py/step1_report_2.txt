  "purpose": "CLI script to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument; if present, calls print_version; otherwise, calls print_info; both functions write to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No unusual behaviors or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that responds to a '--version' argument by printing version info, and otherwise displays package details. It only reads from command-line arguments and writes predefined information to standard output. There are no external data sources, network connections, or untrusted data flows. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
