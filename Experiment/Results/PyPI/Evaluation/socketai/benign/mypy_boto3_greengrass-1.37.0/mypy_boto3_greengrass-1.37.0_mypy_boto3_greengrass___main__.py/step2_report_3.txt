  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility.\n   - It imports `sys`, defines functions to print static package info and version.\n   - It checks for the `--version` argument and outputs accordingly.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - All outputs are static strings, and the control flow is simple.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify the input/output flows, the lack of anomalies, and the absence of suspicious behavior.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate based on the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0`, which is correct. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign `0`, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No issues are present in the code or reports that warrant higher scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is purely based on static code review.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious features.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n   - The confidence level of 1 in all reports is justified.\n\n6. **My Final Estimation**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n   - **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The code and reports indicate a benign utility with no security concerns. The scoring is accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
