  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 Greengrass 1.37.0.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs package info and version)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputs information), no other sinks identified",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers version output, otherwise info is printed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and does not include obfuscated patterns, secrets, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line input to display package info or version. It imports sys, uses sys.argv to detect '--version', and writes outputs to sys.stdout. There are no network operations, file manipulations, environment variable uses, or other suspicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. The code is simple and serves as a CLI utility, with no malicious intent or malicious code indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code is well-structured, simple, and safe.",
