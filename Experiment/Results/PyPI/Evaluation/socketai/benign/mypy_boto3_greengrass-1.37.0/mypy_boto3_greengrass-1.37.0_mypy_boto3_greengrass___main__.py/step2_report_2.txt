  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review and Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` for `--version` and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n   - There are no external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input beyond argument checking.\n   - The code contains no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The logic is straightforward, and the code is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent: all correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and without malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are reasonable given the code content.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - No suspicious behavior or assumptions are made.\n   - The code is static, with no external dependencies or dynamic behaviors.\n\n5. **Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's simplicity and benign purpose.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable assignments are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign CLI utility.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My Own Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final Remarks:**\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and serves a clear informational purpose. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
