  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line argument parsing",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting information",
  "flows": "Input: command-line argument '--version' -> Output: version string or package info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static strings, no dynamic code, no external data sources, no secrets, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that checks for '--version' argument and prints static info or version. It uses sys.argv for input and sys.stdout.write for output. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is simple, clear, and benign, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
