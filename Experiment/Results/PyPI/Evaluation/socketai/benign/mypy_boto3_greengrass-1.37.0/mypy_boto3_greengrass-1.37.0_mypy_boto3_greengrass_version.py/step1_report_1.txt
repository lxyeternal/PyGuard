{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the module, serving as a source of truth for versioning information.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.0' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is inconsistent with the current date (assuming October 2023). No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a metadata attribute assignment (__version__) and a comment with copyright information. There are no code injection, data leakage, environment variable misuse, or malicious actions. The unusual copyright year may indicate an oversight or placeholder, but it is not malicious. No sources or sinks are present, and no flow analysis is needed. Overall, the code is minimal, straightforward, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a version indicator with no malicious or security risks detected. It is a standard pattern used for package versioning, with no suspicious behaviors or security concerns.",
