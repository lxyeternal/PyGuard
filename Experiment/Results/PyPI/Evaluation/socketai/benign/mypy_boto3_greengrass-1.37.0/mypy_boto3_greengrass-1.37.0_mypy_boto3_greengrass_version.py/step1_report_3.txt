  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (2024). This could indicate an inconsistency or a placeholder, but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a static version string to a variable. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The presence of a future copyright date is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which may be an oversight or placeholder.",
