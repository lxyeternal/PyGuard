  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code only assigns a static string `\"1.37.0\"` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The purpose is solely to serve as a version indicator.\n\n2. **Presence of Anomalies:**\n   - All reports note the copyright year as 2025, which is in the future relative to the assumed current date (October 2023). This could be a placeholder or oversight but is not malicious.\n   - No other anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n\n3. **Malware and Security Risks:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Consistency:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n   - The only noted anomaly (future copyright year) does not impact security.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - No report claims or implies any vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0**. No security risks are present.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The future copyright year is likely a placeholder or typo but does not influence security.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions based on the reports.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nThe code is a minimal, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and should be maintained as-is.",
