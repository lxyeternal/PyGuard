  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) in comment, which is likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string '__version__ = \"1.37.0\"' with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or obfuscation. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security. The code is straightforward and serves as a version indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder. All scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) are appropriately set to 0.",
