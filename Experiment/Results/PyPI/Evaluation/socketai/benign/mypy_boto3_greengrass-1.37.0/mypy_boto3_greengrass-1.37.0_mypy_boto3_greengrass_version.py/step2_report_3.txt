  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`.\n   - No input/output, data flow, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No obfuscation or malicious code present.\n   - The only notable aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to October 2023.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for version declaration.\n   - The only common anomaly is the future copyright year.\n   - No report indicates any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The anomaly regarding the future year does not impact security or malware assessments but is noted as an inconsistency.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - The future year might be a placeholder or oversight but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n5. **Recommendations:**\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the current information.\n\n6. **Final Expert Estimation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely an oversight.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
