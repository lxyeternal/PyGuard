  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard type annotation setup for AWS Greengrass, with no dynamic code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, declarative, and intended for static type checking. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions for AWS Greengrass, with no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s nature—no runtime logic, no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static type definitions, no runtime or external data processing, standard import handling.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious patterns or obfuscation are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines types for API requests/responses, no external input, no side effects, no suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—static, type definitions, no runtime logic, no external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected; the code is a standard type schema.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and given the nature of the code—pure type annotations with no runtime or external data—this is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the code is purely declarative, the overall security risk is minimal.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for AWS SDK, specifically for Greengrass. It employs standard Python typing practices, conditional imports for compatibility, and no runtime logic.\n- No secrets, network calls, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate static analysis, documentation, and type checking.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall security risk:** **0**\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type definition module with no security concerns.",
