  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type annotations for AWS Greengrass, with no runtime logic, external data, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, consisting of TypedDicts, constants, and import compatibility handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard for type stubs. The confidence score of 1 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static type definitions, no external data handling, and no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The report accurately notes the absence of dynamic code, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward static type definition module.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is purely declarative.\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Greengrass, with no runtime logic or external interactions.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly states that the code is static, with no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and purely structural.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; the code is standard for SDK type annotations.\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malware present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Type annotations and data structures for API requests/responses, with no external data or runtime actions.\n- **Analysis:** The report accurately notes the absence of dynamic behavior, external data processing, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK schema, safe and non-malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no security risks identified.\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, describing static type definitions for AWS Greengrass, with no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly states that the code is purely declarative, with no external data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and intended for static type checking.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — purely static type annotations, no runtime or external data handling.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\nAll reports consistently identify that this code is a standard set of type annotations for AWS SDKs, specifically for Greengrass. The code is static, well-structured, and uses common Python typing patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, well-formed type stub module, intended solely to improve static analysis and developer experience. No security concerns are present.",
