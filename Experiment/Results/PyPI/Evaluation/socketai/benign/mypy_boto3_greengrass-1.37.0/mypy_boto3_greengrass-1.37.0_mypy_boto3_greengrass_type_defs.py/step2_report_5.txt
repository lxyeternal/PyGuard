  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**  \n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type annotations, TypedDict definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and constants.  \n- No runtime code, data processing, or external interactions are present.  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:**  \n- The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the purely declarative nature of the code.  \n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to malware, obfuscated code, and security risk:**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.  \n- These scores are appropriate given the analysis: the code is static, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code contains no runtime logic or external data handling, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.  \n- The code is a standard type stub for static analysis, not an executable or potentially malicious module.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \n- No malicious activity, code injection, or hidden payloads are detected or suggested.  \n- The code is purely for type annotations, with no network or file system operations.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as static type definitions with no malicious intent.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the analysis is consistent and based on observable code structure.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the reports:**  \n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or malicious intent)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured static type definition module for AWS Greengrass SDK. It is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or security concerns.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analyses provided in all reports.",
