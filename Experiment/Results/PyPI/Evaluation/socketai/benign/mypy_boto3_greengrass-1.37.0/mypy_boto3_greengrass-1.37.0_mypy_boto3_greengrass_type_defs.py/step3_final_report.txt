  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Greengrass SDK, intended for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Type definitions, constants, and import compatibility handling; no external data input or runtime logic.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; purely declarative type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow; static type definitions without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDicts, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, secrets, or obfuscation. The purpose is to facilitate static analysis, IDE support, and documentation. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-formed set of static type annotations for AWS Greengrass SDK. It is purely declarative, with no runtime or external interactions, and poses no security threat.",
