  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for AWS Greengrass service models to ensure type safety and improve code readability.",
  "sources": "Reads source code, type annotations, and import statements. No external input data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static type definitions and annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only static type definitions, imports, and documentation comments. No dynamic execution, code injection, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, conditional imports based on Python version, and documentation. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external interactions. The imports are standard for type annotations and documentation purposes. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure is typical for type definition files meant to enhance static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely provides type annotations for AWS Greengrass SDK models. No malicious activities or security risks are evident.",
