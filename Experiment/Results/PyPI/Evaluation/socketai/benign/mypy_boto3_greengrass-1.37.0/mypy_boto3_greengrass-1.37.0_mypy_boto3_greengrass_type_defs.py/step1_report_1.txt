{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Greengrass service data structures to facilitate static type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotation definitions, import statements, and static data structure declarations; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No network calls, file manipulations, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, import compatibility handling, and data structure definitions using TypedDict and Union for static type checking. No runtime code, no data input/output, and no side effects. The initial comments include licensing and documentation links. The structure is standard for type stub files. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The use of conditional imports for compatibility is routine and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS Greengrass SDK. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious library component intended for static type checking.",
