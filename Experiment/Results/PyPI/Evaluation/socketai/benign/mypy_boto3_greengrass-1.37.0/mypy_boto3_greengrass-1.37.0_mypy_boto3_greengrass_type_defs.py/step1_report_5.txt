{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Greengrass service API requests and responses, mainly for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code defines class-based TypedDict structures and type unions for various API request and response data. It reads no external input; it only declares data types.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, external system interactions, or code execution points. The code does not process untrusted data or perform actions like network calls, file access, or command execution.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows from source to sink, as the code only defines types and data structures without any functional logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. It uses standard Python typing features and conditional imports for compatibility, which is common in SDKs and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The entire script is a comprehensive set of type definitions for the AWS Greengrass SDK. It uses standard Python typing and TypedDict to describe data structures, with no executable logic, external data handling, or side-effects. It includes conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, which is typical for maintaining broad compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema for API data. All components are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK type definition module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It provides structured data schemas for AWS Greengrass API interactions without any runtime logic or external data handling. It appears safe and purely structural.",
