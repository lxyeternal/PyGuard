  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for AWS Greengrass service API responses and requests using TypedDict.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, import statements, type annotations, and data structure declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows from untrusted sources; all data structures are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to potentially dangerous sinks; primarily type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no backdoors or malicious code detected. The code is purely declarative, defining types and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, TypedDict class definitions, and import logic for conditional Python versions. It imports standard and third-party modules safely, with no execution of untrusted data or dynamic code. No suspicious code patterns, such as code injection, network access, or malicious logic, are present. All components serve to facilitate static type checking for an AWS SDK client, with no runtime behavior or potential attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, static type definition module for AWS Greengrass, with no malicious intent or malicious behavior evident. It merely provides type annotations for better code correctness and clarity. The overall security risk is minimal.",
