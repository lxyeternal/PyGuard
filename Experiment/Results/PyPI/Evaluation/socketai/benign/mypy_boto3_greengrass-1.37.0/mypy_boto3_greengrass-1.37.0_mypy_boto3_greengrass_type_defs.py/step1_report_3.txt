{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations for AWS Greengrass service data structures, primarily defining TypedDicts, Unions, and constants to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input mainly through type annotations and constants imported from other modules, with no runtime input handling. It also imports sys to determine Python version features.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code defines data structures used elsewhere; no direct data flow or untrusted data handling is present within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. It is purely declarative with type definitions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The entire code is a comprehensive set of type definitions using Python's typing and TypedDict, aimed at ensuring type safety for a larger AWS SDK or infrastructure project. It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions, and defines numerous data structures, unions, and constants related to AWS Greengrass. The code is static, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors. The purpose appears purely to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structured set of type definitions for AWS Greengrass SDK data structures. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. The code is purely declarative and aligns with standard practices for type hinting and module documentation.",
