  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS Greengrass and AWS service string constants for type safety and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing or handling of external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code only defines string literal types and conditional imports; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The import of 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' is standard practice for compatibility across Python versions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely for defining type annotations with Literal for AWS Greengrass and other AWS services. It includes version-based conditional import to ensure compatibility. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, no network communication, no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The purpose appears purely to facilitate type checking and code clarity for AWS service interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining string constants for type safety. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
