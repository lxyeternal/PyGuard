  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step to assess the security implications, accuracy, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward static module defining string literal types for AWS Greengrass and related AWS services.\n- No dynamic code, no external data processing, no network activity, no secrets, and no executable logic.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard for compatibility.\n- The extensive list of string literals appears to serve as enums or constrained value sets, typical for API type annotations.\n\n**2. Logical flaws, errors, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports uniformly describe the code as benign, with no malicious intent, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is future-dated and unusual but not malicious.\n- No mention of potential obfuscation or hidden code, which is correct since the code is static and transparent.\n\n**3. Score assessments:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues or suspicious behaviors are present; thus, risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation that could hide malicious intent.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the code is purely for type annotations, which is accurate.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are necessary; the evidence supports benign intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n- The scores accurately reflect the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a static, well-structured module defining string literal types for AWS SDK type safety.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is purely declarative for type safety, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
