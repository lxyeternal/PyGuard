  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or discrepancies.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely for defining string literal types for AWS Greengrass and related services.\n- They highlight that the code contains no external data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no secrets.\n- The only notable aspect is the conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.\n- The copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- No report suggests obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - No issues or malicious code are present.\n   - The code is static, for type annotations, with no dynamic or external data.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk; all are justified in scoring 0.\n   - The code is purely for type safety and documentation.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports.\n   - No malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities as the code is static and benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- The copyright year being 2025 is unusual but not suspicious.\n- The conditional import for compatibility is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk, no external data handling, no secrets)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, static module defining string literal types for AWS Greengrass and related services. All evidence points to a straightforward, safe utility module for type annotations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the existing assessments. The code is safe, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
