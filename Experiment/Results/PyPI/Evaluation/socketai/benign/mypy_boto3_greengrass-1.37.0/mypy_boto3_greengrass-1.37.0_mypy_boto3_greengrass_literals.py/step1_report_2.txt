{
  "purpose": "To define type annotations for various literals used in the greengrass service and AWS resource identifiers, facilitating type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module for version check, and the code itself defining string literals.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—no data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The import of sys and conditional import of Literal are standard practices for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility approach. It then defines multiple string literal types as type annotations for use elsewhere. The purpose is purely to provide type hints; there is no data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior. The extensive list of string literals appears to serve as enums or constrained value sets, typical for API type annotations. No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent are present. The code does not perform any operations besides defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for type annotations of literals used in the greengrass AWS SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices for type hinting and version compatibility, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
