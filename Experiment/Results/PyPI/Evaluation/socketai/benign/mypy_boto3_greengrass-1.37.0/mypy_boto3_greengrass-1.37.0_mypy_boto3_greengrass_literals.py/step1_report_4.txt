{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Greengrass and related service constants to enable type checking and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements, the sys.version_info check for conditional import, and the definition of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or untrusted command execution; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The only dynamic element is the conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple type aliases for string literals used in AWS SDK for Python (boto3) for validation and type checking purposes. It imports 'Literal' conditionally depending on Python version. The '__all__' variable lists all exported names. No functions, data processing, external data reads, or untrusted input handling is present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a static configuration module for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a standard type annotation definitions file for boto3 Greengrass literals. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. It is purely declarative, with no security risks associated.",
