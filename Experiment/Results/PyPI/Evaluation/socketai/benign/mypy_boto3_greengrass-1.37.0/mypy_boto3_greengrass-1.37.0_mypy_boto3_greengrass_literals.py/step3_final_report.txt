  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Greengrass and related AWS services to enable type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year '2025', which is unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS SDKs, with compatibility handling for different Python versions. No dynamic code, external data, secrets, or executable logic are present. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright notice, which does not impact security. The code's purpose is purely for type annotations, and it does not pose any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type safety. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are accurate and appropriate.",
