  "purpose": "Define type annotations using Python Literal for various Greengrass service literals and related constants for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Type annotation definitions and import statements; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present; the code is solely static definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static type annotations do not involve runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs detected. The code appears to be straightforward type annotation definitions. The only notable aspect is the conditional import based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various Literal types for use as type annotations in a larger project, primarily for documenting and constraining string values representing constants and enumerations. The import logic for 'Literal' is version-dependent but normal. There are no dynamic inputs, external data handling, or potentially malicious code behaviors. The license statement and documentation are benign. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static module for type annotations, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is purely for defining constants and literals for type safety and documentation purposes.",
