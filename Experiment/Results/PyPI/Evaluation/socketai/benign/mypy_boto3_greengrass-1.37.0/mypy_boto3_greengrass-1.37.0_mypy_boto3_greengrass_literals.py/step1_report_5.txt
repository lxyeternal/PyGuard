  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various literal string values used in the Greengrass service module, primarily for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals assigned to type variables; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only defines constants for type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code purely declares static type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The only dynamic element is the conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to declare a series of Literal type annotations for various string constants relevant to the AWS Greengrass service and other AWS services. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version for compatibility. The large number of predefined string literals serves as type hints and does not involve data processing, external inputs, or execution logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or hidden functionality. The structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This module is solely for defining type-safe string literals for use in other parts of a larger codebase. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
