  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defining type literals for AWS Greengrass and services.\n- Sources: Importing sys, conditional import of Literal.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data handling or external input.\n- Anomalies: Future year in copyright (2025) is unusual but benign.\n- Analysis: Purely static type definitions, compatibility handling, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, purely for type safety.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, no malware, no obfuscation. The note about the future year is benign. The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define type annotations for AWS resource identifiers.\n- Sources: Import sys, conditional import.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data processing.\n- Anomalies: Future year (2025) in copyright.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern for static type hints, no dynamic code or external data.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The scores are consistent. The future year is unusual but not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define literals for AWS Greengrass and related constants.\n- Sources: Type annotations, import statements.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data handling.\n- Anomalies: Future year (2025) again, but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Static definitions, version-based import for compatibility, no dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Define string literal types for AWS services.\n- Sources: Import statements, conditional import.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data processing.\n- Anomalies: Future year (2025), benign.\n- Analysis: Static type annotations, no runtime logic.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Declare literals for AWS Greengrass and services.\n- Sources: Hardcoded string literals, conditional import.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data handling.\n- Anomalies: Future year (2025), benign.\n- Analysis: Static, straightforward type definitions.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** Purely static type annotations defining string literals for AWS services and Greengrass, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n- **Malicious/Malware Indicators:** None. No code execution, network activity, external data handling, or secrets.\n- **Obfuscation:** None. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the future year (2025) in the copyright notice, which is benign.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected.\n\n### Final Score Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk, static definitions only)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured module for type safety annotations in Python, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The existing scores are accurate, and I agree with the overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is purely static type annotations for AWS SDK constants.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The only minor anomaly (future year 2025) is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
