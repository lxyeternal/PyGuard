{
  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for the Greengrass service client in boto3, with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods that call 'paginate' with unpacked kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs) that are unpacked into the Paginator's 'paginate' method.",
  "flows": "Kwargs are passed directly into the 'paginate' method, which could, in theory, include untrusted data, but in typical usage with boto3, these are controlled parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No network, file, or environment variable access is present. The code strictly defines classes for pagination with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates paginator classes for various Greengrass API calls, inheriting from 'Paginator' and defining 'paginate' methods with type annotations. It includes detailed type hints, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation links for each class and method. No suspicious dynamic code execution, network access, or data collection is observed. The use of 'Unpack' and '**kwargs' is consistent with boto3 paginator patterns. No embedded secrets or backdoors are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured type-safe wrapper for boto3 paginators, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, type-annotated set of paginator class definitions for the boto3 Greengrass client. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks beyond the typical considerations of passing untrusted parameters to an API. It is intended for type safety and documentation enhancement, not for malicious actions.",
