{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the greengrass service client, facilitating type-safe pagination in Python scripts using boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and custom type definitions. No direct user input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code defines classes and methods for pagination; no data output, network calls, or data leaks are implemented here.",
  "flows": "The paginator classes' paginate methods accept parameters (kwargs) for API requests and return iterators over response data; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy violations are present. The code strictly adheres to static type definitions and class structures for boto3.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes with type annotations, following standard patterns for boto3 paginator extension. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, no dynamic execution or external code invocation is present, and no suspicious operations are performed. The structure is consistent, and the logic is straightforward, serving as a type-safe wrapper around boto3 pagination.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code. It is a benign, structured implementation of boto3 paginator classes with clear documentation and no suspicious behaviors.",
