  "finalSummary": "The code is a standard, auto-generated set of boto3 type stubs and paginator class definitions for AWS Greengrass. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The structure involves static class definitions, type annotations, and documented method signatures, with no runtime or external data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code content. Therefore, the overall assessment confirms the code is safe and purely for static type checking purposes.",
