{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for greengrass service client, enabling type-safe pagination over AWS greengrass resources.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration from docstrings, import statements, and class definitions; no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; paginator methods are standard, and there are no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Paginator classes define paginate methods that accept kwargs with specific types; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code structure is consistent with auto-generated type annotations. No malicious backdoors, system calls, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, following standard boto3 documentation and mypy stub patterns. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, typical in type stub implementations. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or system modifications are present. The overall design is to facilitate static type checking and does not include any code that could be malicious or sabotage. The import statements, class inheritance, and method signatures align with expected patterns for boto3 paginators, with no suspicious anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for the greengrass client, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical part of type stubs for AWS SDKs, intended solely to improve type safety and IDE support.",
