{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS Greengrass service, providing method signatures for SDK operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules for request and response types; class and method definitions for AWS SDK interface.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters unpacking into request types; return of response types; no external or untrusted data sources directly accessed.",
  "flows": "Method calls with kwargs unpacked into request type defs; response types returned directly; no flow of untrusted data to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; extensive use of method overloading for SDK paginator creation; no suspicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a client class for the AWS Greengrass service with detailed method signatures and type annotations. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK components, and offers no data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling outside typical SDK patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external malicious calls are present. The purpose is to facilitate type-safe SDK interaction, with clear documentation links. The use of overloads for paginator creation is standard for SDK clients, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, type-annotated SDK client interface for AWS Greengrass, containing no malicious or sabotage behavior. It is focused on providing method signatures for AWS operations with no indication of security risks or malware.",
