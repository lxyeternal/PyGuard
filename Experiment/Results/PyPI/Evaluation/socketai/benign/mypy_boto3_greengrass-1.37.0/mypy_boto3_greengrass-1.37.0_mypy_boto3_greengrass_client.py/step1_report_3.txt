{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for AWS Greengrass service, providing a structured interface to interact with the AWS Greengrass API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method definitions that wrap AWS API calls; overload functions for paginator creation.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that invoke AWS SDK operations, passing untrusted parameters (though these are type definitions), and returning data from AWS services. No direct data sinks to external systems or network in the code itself.",
  "flows": "User inputs (via **kwargs) flow into method calls that prepare API requests; responses from AWS services flow back as method return values. The type annotations facilitate type safety but do not influence runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, network connections outside AWS SDK, backdoors, or hidden data leaks. The code strictly defines types and wrappers around AWS SDK methods. No code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, type-annotated client wrapper for AWS Greengrass, heavily relying on type hints and overloads for paginator functions. It does not contain executable logic beyond method signatures and type annotations. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage. All data flows are within expected API interactions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper for AWS Greengrass with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely facilitates typed access to AWS services without executing any harmful or unauthorized actions.",
