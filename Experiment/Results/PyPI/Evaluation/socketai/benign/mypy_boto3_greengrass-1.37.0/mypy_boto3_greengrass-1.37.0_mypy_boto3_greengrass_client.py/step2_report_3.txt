  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the code's nature, potential risks, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a type-safe, well-structured SDK wrapper for AWS Greengrass.\n- They highlight the extensive use of type annotations, overloads for paginators, and standard SDK method signatures.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code behaviors are detected.\n- The code is primarily focused on defining interfaces and method signatures, with no evidence of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The generate_presigned_url method is standard for AWS SDKs, not inherently malicious.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low to zero security risks.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity outside the SDK, or malicious payloads.\n- The import statements and method signatures are standard and align with typical SDK wrapper patterns.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The use of type annotations and overloads is consistent with type-safe SDK design.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the generate_presigned_url method, which, if misused, could generate malicious URLs. However, this is a standard SDK feature, not malicious in itself.\n- The use of **kwargs and Unpack[TypeDef] is standard for flexible API request parameter passing, not suspicious.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable structure.\n- Risk: The highest risk score is 0.1, which is very low, reflecting the standard nature of the code and minimal security concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper for AWS Greengrass.\n- No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks.\n- The low risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to the presigned URL feature, which is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe and legitimate. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard, type-safe AWS SDK client wrapper with no malicious or security concerns.",
