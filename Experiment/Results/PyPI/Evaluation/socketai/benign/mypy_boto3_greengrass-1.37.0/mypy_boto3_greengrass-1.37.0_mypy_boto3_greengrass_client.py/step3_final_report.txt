  "purpose": "Type annotations for greengrass service Client.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type definitions, and import statements related to AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sinks": "API method calls with kwargs, response returns, and URL presigning functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters unpacked into SDK calls; responses returned directly; presigned URLs generated for AWS resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, type-safe wrapper around the AWS Greengrass SDK, primarily consisting of method signatures, overloads for paginators, and documentation links. It does not execute any logic beyond defining interfaces, and all patterns are standard for SDK wrappers. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The generate_presigned_url method is a typical AWS SDK feature, not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and potential for misuse if misconfigured, but not indicative of actual malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score reflects the inherent potential for misuse of SDK features like presigned URLs, but the code itself is benign. All reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
