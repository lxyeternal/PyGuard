{
  "purpose": "Define and export the main interface and dependencies for the greengrass service, including classes and paginators, for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the embedded usage example in the docstring.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or output directly from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is primarily declarative and import/export oriented, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage example in docstring appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly a module that imports classes from internal modules (.client and .paginator), assigns a class alias, and defines __all__ for exports. The embedded docstring provides example usage, which is standard for SDK-like modules. No dynamic execution, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code are present. No signs of malicious activity such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward interface definition for AWS Greengrass SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module for AWS Greengrass SDK components. It imports, re-exports, and documents these components without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indicators identified.",
