  "purpose": "Module setup and interface definitions for AWS Greengrass SDK, including import/export statements and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and string literals in documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static import/export setup with no runtime data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a class alias 'Client = GreengrassClient' is harmless; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions, defines an alias, and sets __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, no external data processing, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The documentation is standard, and the code serves as an SDK interface setup. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The slight elevation of the security risk score to 0.1 in one report is unjustified; it should be adjusted to 0. for accuracy.",
