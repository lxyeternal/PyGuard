{
  "purpose": "This code modifies pytest behavior to treat skipped tests as failures based on a command-line option.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line options via 'pytest_addoption' and accessing test item configuration with 'item.config.getoption'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points; no data leaks or malicious effects observed.",
  "flows": "Command-line option '--error-for-skips' is set, which influences test outcome handling within 'pytest_runtest_makereport'.",
  "anomalies": "The code manipulates test outcomes based on a custom option but does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest hooks: 'pytest_addoption' adds a custom command-line argument, and 'pytest_runtest_makereport' modifies test reports when the '--error-for-skips' flag is used. It converts skipped tests into failures by adjusting the report's outcome. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or backdoors. The code is standard for customizing pytest behavior. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign testing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless customization of pytest for test reporting behavior with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
