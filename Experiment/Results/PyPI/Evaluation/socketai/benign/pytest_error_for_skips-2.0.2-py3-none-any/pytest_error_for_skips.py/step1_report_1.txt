{
  "purpose": "The code enhances pytest testing framework by adding a command-line option and a hook implementation to modify test outcome handling, specifically treating skipped tests as failures based on user input.",
  "sources": "Input is taken via the command-line option '--error-for-skips' provided by pytest's parser.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or send data externally; it only modifies test report outcomes internally within pytest.",
  "flows": "The command-line option '--error-for-skips' is set by the user; the pytest hook uses this option to alter test outcome representation if a test is skipped.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines a hook implementation 'pytest_runtest_makereport' that alters the test report outcome based on a user-provided command-line flag. The 'pytest_addoption' function adds this flag to pytest's CLI options. The hook checks if the flag is set and whether a test was skipped due to an exception. If so, it changes the test outcome from 'skipped' to 'failed' and updates the report with a message. The code functions solely to modify pytest reporting behavior and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest plugin snippet intended to customize test reporting behavior. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It is a benign, purposeful extension of pytest.",
