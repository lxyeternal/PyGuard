{
  "purpose": "This code customizes pytest behavior by adding a command-line option and modifying test reporting for skipped tests.",
  "sources": "Reads the '--error-for-skips' command-line argument from pytest configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads command-line option '--error-for-skips' and modifies test outcome based on its value; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines a hook implementation 'pytest_runtest_makereport' that alters test reports when a specific command-line option is used. It also adds this command-line option with 'pytest_addoption'. Both are standard pytest plugin practices. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest plugin snippet that modifies test reporting behavior based on user input. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
