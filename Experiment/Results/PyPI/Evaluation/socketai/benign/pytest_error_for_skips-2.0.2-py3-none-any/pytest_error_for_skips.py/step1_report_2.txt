{
  "purpose": "Enhance pytest testing framework by adding an option to treat skipped tests as errors and customize test reporting behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration options via 'item.config.getoption' and handles test report objects through 'pytest_runtest_makereport'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially affects test execution outcomes but does not directly lead to data leaks or security breaches.",
  "flows": "Configuration option '--error-for-skips' is read during test execution; influences test outcome handling in 'pytest_runtest_makereport'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; the code is straightforward plugin code for pytest, with no hidden or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest hook functions: one to modify test reports based on a custom command-line option, and another to add that command-line option. The logic involves checking if the '--error-for-skips' flag is set and, if so, changing the outcome of skipped tests to failed. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code. The code operates within the testing framework context and has no network or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest plugin implementation that adds a command-line option and alters test report outcomes based on user configuration. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
