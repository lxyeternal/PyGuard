{
  "purpose": "This code modifies the behavior of pytest testing framework to treat skipped tests as failures if a specific command-line option is used.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line option '--error-for-skips' provided by the user through pytest's parser.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "User provides '--error-for-skips' -> pytest_addoption registers the option -> pytest_runtest_makereport checks if the option is set and modifies test outcome accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard pytest hooks and option registration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hook implementation 'pytest_runtest_makereport' that wraps around the test report generation. It checks if the '--error-for-skips' option is enabled; if so, it treats skipped tests as failed by modifying the report outcome. The 'pytest_addoption' function adds this command-line option to pytest. The code uses standard pytest APIs with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, external network access, or obfuscation patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin snippet that alters test behavior based on user input. There are no malicious or security-sensitive elements identified. It appears to be safe and intended for customizing test outcomes.",
