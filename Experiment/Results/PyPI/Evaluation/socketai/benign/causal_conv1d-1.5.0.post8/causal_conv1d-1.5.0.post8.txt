The primary concern is the external wheel download without verification, which poses a supply chain risk but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2–0.3) is appropriate given the external dependency without validation."

The primary security concern is the unverified external CUDA extension, which should be validated for trustworthiness. Overall, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2 due to dependency trust issues."
