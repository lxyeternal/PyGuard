  "purpose": "Define a version string and import functions from an external module related to causal convolution in neural networks.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the import statement 'from causal_conv1d.causal_conv1d_interface import causal_conv1d_fn, causal_conv1d_update'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions, but no usage shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code sets version information and imports functions; no data flow or processing demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual constructs; only straightforward import and version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string indicating package version, and imports two functions from a module likely related to causal convolutional layers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The imported functions are not used in this fragment, so their behavior cannot be assessed, but their names suggest they are part of a neural network implementation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, consisting of version declaration and standard imports without any signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
