  "purpose": "Define the package version and import functions from an external module related to causal convolution.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ string; import statement from causal_conv1d.causal_conv1d_interface",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Version string assignment; import functions are statically imported without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version declaration and import with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal: it sets a version string and imports functions from a presumably legitimate external library. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. The imported functions' names suggest standard neural network or signal processing functionality. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero with high confidence. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment, and the scores are consistent with this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No further action is necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
