  "purpose": "Define the version of the package and import specific functions from a module related to causal convolution operations.",
  "sources": "The module causal_conv1d.causal_conv1d_interface, specifically the functions causal_conv1d_fn and causal_conv1d_update.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports two functions from a local module. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or data transmission. The imported functions are presumably part of a neural network or signal processing library. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with versioning and imports. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
