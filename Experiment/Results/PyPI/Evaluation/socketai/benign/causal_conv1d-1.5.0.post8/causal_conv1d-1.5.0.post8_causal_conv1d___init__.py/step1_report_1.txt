  "purpose": "Import functions related to causal convolution operations from an external module, likely for neural network or signal processing tasks.",
  "sources": "__version__ variable declaration and import statement indicating external module usage.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling, no network operations, no sensitive data access.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static assignment and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for a module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and imports specific functions from an external module related to causal convolution. The version string appears to be a standard package version identifier. The import statements are direct and do not perform any dynamic execution or contain suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code is a simple setup snippet typical for a Python package or module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as part of a larger project that utilizes causal convolution functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks based on this snippet.",
