  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a legitimate build and setup script for 'causal_conv1d', handling CUDA/HIP extensions, version checks, and wheel distribution. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Key points:** No suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors, standard environment checks, and downloads are for prebuilt wheels from GitHub.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious code found)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, due to reliance on external wheel download but not malicious)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the download of prebuilt wheels from GitHub, which could be a supply chain risk if the server is compromised.\n- **Key points:** The code downloads wheels dynamically without verification, which is a potential vector for supply chain attacks.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected, just external download)\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 (moderate, due to external dependency without verification)\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The concern about downloading wheels without checksum verification is valid, but no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the dynamic wheel fetching process, noting that it could be exploited if the URL or server is malicious.\n- **Key points:** No backdoors or malicious code, but external wheel download without validation poses a supply chain risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, standard build process with external dependency)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The main concern is trust in the external source, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlighting the dynamic download of wheels and the environment-dependent build process.\n- **Key points:** External wheel download is a potential supply chain vector, but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is typical for such build scripts, with the caveat of external dependency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard build script with external wheel fetching based on environment parameters.\n- **Key points:** No malicious code, but reliance on external downloads without verification is a concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, performing environment checks, version detection, and downloading prebuilt wheels from GitHub. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; the code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** The main concern is the reliance on external wheel files downloaded from GitHub without integrity verification, which could be exploited if the remote server is compromised or if the URL is manipulated. However, this is a common practice in open source distribution and not inherently malicious.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **around 0.2–0.3**, reflecting the potential supply chain risk due to external wheel downloads, but not indicating any active malicious intent.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, legitimate build and setup script with external wheel fetching. The main concern is the potential supply chain risk from downloading prebuilt binaries without verification, which is a common but noteworthy issue. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation is present.",
