  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and distribution setup with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the external wheel download without verification, which poses a supply chain risk but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low risk score (~0.2–0.3) is appropriate given the external dependency without validation."
