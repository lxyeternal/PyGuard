  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for mnemonic handling, address derivation, and encryption/decryption for various cryptocurrencies.",
  "sources": "Input mnemonics, encrypted payloads, environment variables, external function calls (erc20_scanner.decrypto_mnemonic_bytes, blocksmith.BitcoinWallet.generate_address).",
  "sinks": "Decrypted data, generated addresses and private keys, external function outputs.",
  "flows": "Mnemonic input -> cryptographic processing -> address/private key output; payload data -> decryption -> JSON result.",
  "anomalies": "Call to external function erc20_scanner.decrypto_mnemonic_bytes during initialization; broad exception handling masks errors; external dependencies without clear validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations and address derivations for multiple cryptocurrencies. External calls to erc20_scanner and blocksmith are suspicious but lack evidence of malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed. Broad exception handling could hide errors but does not indicate malicious behavior. Sensitive data handling is typical but warrants caution. Overall, the code appears benign but external dependencies should be reviewed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic wallet utility with external dependencies that are suspicious but not confirmed malicious. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present. The overall security risk is low, with a slight concern due to external calls and broad exception handling.",
