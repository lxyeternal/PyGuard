{
  "purpose": "This module provides a socket-like interface for establishing network connections through SOCKS proxies, supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies.",
  "sources": "The code reads proxy configuration parameters from the setproxy or setdefaultproxy functions, and from socket connection attempts during the connect method.",
  "sinks": "The connect method initiates network connections potentially using proxy settings; the __recvall method reads data from sockets; sendall sends data over the socket; the negotiation functions process data received from proxy servers.",
  "flows": "Proxy parameters are set via setproxy/setdefaultproxy, influencing subsequent socket connections in connect(). Data is sent/received during proxy negotiations (__negotiatesocks5, __negotiatesocks4, __negotiatehttp), and the connection is established to target addresses through these negotiations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains the custom bytes() function for Python 2 compatibility, which returns the object unmodified—potentially unsafe if used improperly. The code does not sanitize or validate all inputs robustly, but mostly relies on exceptions. There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Some variable naming and data handling (e.g., manual string handling for network protocols) are low-level but standard for socket programming.",
  "analysis": "The module mainly implements proxy negotiation protocols with no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system commands, or backdoors. The functions are dedicated to establishing connections via SOCKS/HTTP proxies, and all data flows are related to these negotiations or socket operations. The presence of custom error classes and detailed exception handling indicates a focus on connection management. No suspicious network communications, such as system info leaks or external data transfers, are evident. The use of the bytes() function is a minimal compatibility measure and not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of proxy socket handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy support for Python sockets, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs proxy negotiations and manages socket connections appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or malicious data handling were detected.",
