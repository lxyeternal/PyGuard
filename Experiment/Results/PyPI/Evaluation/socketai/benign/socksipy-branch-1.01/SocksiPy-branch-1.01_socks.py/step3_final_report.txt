{
  "purpose": "A Python module implementing SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxy clients, allowing tunneling connections through specified proxies.",
  "sources": "Socket operations such as recv() and sendall() during proxy negotiation and connection setup.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data during negotiation (e.g., destaddr, destport) used in socket connect and protocol messages.",
  "flows": "Source data (destaddr, destport) flows through protocol negotiation functions (__negotiatesocks5, __negotiatesocks4, __negotiatehttp) to establish a connection via proxy.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom bytes() for Python 2 compatibility; standard string concatenation and decoding; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard proxy negotiation protocols with explicit socket communication routines. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. The manual protocol handling is typical for such modules. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident. The exception handling and connection routines follow standard practices. The overall structure and behavior align with legitimate proxy client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS/HTTP proxy client with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects inherent network operation risks but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
