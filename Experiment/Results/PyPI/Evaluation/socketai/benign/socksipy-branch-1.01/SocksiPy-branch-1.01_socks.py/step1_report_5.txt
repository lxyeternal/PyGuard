{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python module for tunneling network connections through SOCKS and HTTP proxies, allowing programs to route traffic via proxies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: user-supplied proxy settings (setproxy, setproxy parameters), destination address and port in connect method, and data received from remote proxies or servers (recvall, recv).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: data sent to proxies (sendall), and data received from proxies or remote servers (recvall, recv). These can lead to data leakage if untrusted data is mishandled, but are standard socket operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (proxy configuration, destination address/port) into connection negotiation functions (__negotiatesocks5, __negotiatesocks4, __negotiatehttp). The flow then proceeds through socket connection establishment, with data being sent and received during proxy handshake and connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code contains standard proxy negotiation logic and socket handling. No suspicious or malicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxy protocols for establishing network connections through proxies. It includes typical error handling, proxy negotiation, and connection methods. No obfuscated language features, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling routines were identified. All operations are consistent with proxy connection procedures. The code does not contain any signs of malicious activity such as unauthorized data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise mechanisms. Its design and logic are aligned with intended proxy support functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a SOCKS/HTTP proxy client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected proxy negotiation and socket connection procedures without any suspicious modifications or hidden functionalities.",
