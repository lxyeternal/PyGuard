  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the SocksiPy-branch Python module.",
  "sources": "Static data in the script such as version, name, description, URL, author, email, license, and module list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external inputs or outputs are handled dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only defines static metadata for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from distutils.core and defines package metadata including name, version, description, URL, author details, license, and modules. All data appears to be hardcoded static strings, with no user input, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors. No potentially malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
