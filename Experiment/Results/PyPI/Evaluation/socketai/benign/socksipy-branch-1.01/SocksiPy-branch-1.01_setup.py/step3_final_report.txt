{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script used to configure and distribute the 'SocksiPy-branch' module, defining its metadata and included modules.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata definitions, including name, version, description, URL, author info, license, and the 'socks' module reference.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted data or perform any network or system operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only sets up package configuration without dynamic data flow or execution beyond initial setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The only consideration is the included 'socks' module, which is not inspected here; its safety depends on its own content. Overall, the setup script itself poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary based solely on this script.",
