  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python SOCKS module package named 'SocksiPy-branch'.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals such as VERSION, name, description, long_description, url, author, author_email, license, and the py_modules list.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flow points that handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines package metadata and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward package setup configuration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from distutils.core, defines a version string, and calls setup() with package metadata including name, description, URL, author info, license, and module list. There are no dynamic or potentially malicious operations. The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. It does not perform any network operations, data handling, or system modifications beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It only contains package metadata and setup configuration, presenting no supply chain or security risks.",
