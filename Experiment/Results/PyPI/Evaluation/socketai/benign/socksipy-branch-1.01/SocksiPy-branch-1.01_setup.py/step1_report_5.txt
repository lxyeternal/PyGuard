{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python SOCKS module 'SocksiPy-branch', used to distribute and install the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, description, URL, author, and license.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded metadata (name, version, description, URL, author, email) into the setup configuration, with no dynamic or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard setup procedures. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It imports the distutils setup function, defines static package metadata, and calls setup() with this data. There are no user inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or other suspicious activities. The author email and URL are standard, and no potentially malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata for distribution.",
