{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'SocksiPy-branch', intended to facilitate SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded variables (VERSION, package metadata), the setup() function parameters, and the 'socks' module included in py_modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities; no data output, network activity, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The package metadata flows into the setup() function which prepares the package for distribution; no data flows involving untrusted inputs or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; usage of standard setup utilities and straightforward package configuration. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python module. It specifies package metadata and includes a module named 'socks'. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or contain logic that could be malicious. All elements are typical for Python package setup scripts. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution with provided metadata.",
