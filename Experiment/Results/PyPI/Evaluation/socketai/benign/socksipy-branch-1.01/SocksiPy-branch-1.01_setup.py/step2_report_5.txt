  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup script for packaging a Python module.\n- No reports detect any dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, aligning with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only defines static package metadata and calls `setup()`.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The package's purpose is to facilitate SOCKS proxy connections, which is a legitimate functionality.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The reports do not mention inspecting the actual 'socks' module included in `py_modules=[\"socks\"]`. Since the setup script only references this module, the security implications depend heavily on the content of that module.\n- The setup script itself appears benign; however, the security risk could stem from the included 'socks' module if it contains malicious code or backdoors.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate given the setup script content.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are low, which is justified for the setup script alone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based solely on the provided setup script, there are no signs of malicious activity.\n- The real security concern would be the contents of the 'socks' module, which is not provided here.\n- The reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable.\n- To fully assess supply chain security, an analysis of the 'socks' module code is necessary.\n- As it stands, the setup script itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0 (the reports assign 0.1 in one case; given no malicious content, 0 is more appropriate)\n\n**Note:** If the 'socks' module is examined and found to be clean, the overall supply chain risk remains low. If malicious code is discovered there, scores should be adjusted accordingly.",
