  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs Gaussian centroiding, masks invalid data, and uses standard libraries (`astropy`, `numpy`). No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Findings:** The code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar centroiding functions, standard data processing, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no network activity, just data validation and Gaussian fitting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — slightly above zero, but justified given the data handling and warnings.\n- **Justification:** The small risk score reflects the minimal processing; no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard centroiding routines, masking, Gaussian fitting, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — consistent with the code's scope.\n- **Justification:** Similar reasoning as above.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard centroiding, masking, fitting, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of sabotage or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — justified.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward and secure.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard centroiding functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, justified by standard data validation and warnings, but no actual security risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of centroiding routines with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The risk scores of 0.1 are acceptable given the data handling but do not indicate any real security concern.\n- Malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to data validation and warning mechanisms, but no actual risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and well-structured. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
