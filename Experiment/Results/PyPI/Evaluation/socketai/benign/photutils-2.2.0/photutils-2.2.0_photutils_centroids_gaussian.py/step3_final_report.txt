{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for centroiding sources in astronomical images using Gaussian fitting methods, handling invalid data, and estimating initial parameters for fitting routines.",
  "sources": "Data input from 2D numpy arrays representing images, and optional error and mask arrays; data is read directly from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; the code performs in-memory computations only, with warnings for data issues but no network or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data is masked and validated, then passed to Gaussian fitting routines; initial parameter estimation flows into the fitting process, with no external data or network interactions involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; the code uses standard scientific libraries and practices, with proper masking and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard centroiding procedures with robust data validation, masking, and Gaussian fitting. It handles non-finite data gracefully, issues warnings appropriately, and uses well-established libraries. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are designed for scientific data analysis, not for malicious activities. The data flow is straightforward, with no external communication or hidden logic. The code is transparent, well-structured, and adheres to best practices for scientific computing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of astronomical centroiding routines, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and suitable for scientific use.",
