  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate the centroid of sources in 2D data arrays by fitting Gaussian models, for use in astronomical image analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (`data`, `error`, `mask`) from function parameters and processes them through `process_quantities`. Reads from numpy arrays and process_quantities.",
  "sinks": "Uses fitting functions (`TRFLSQFitter`) to perform model fitting on data; potential sink if data were maliciously crafted to trigger excessive computation or crash. No network operations or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Input data -> process_quantities (possibly mask invalid values) -> masked arrays -> fitting procedures (Gaussian models) -> centroid output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Uses standard libraries and known astrophysics packages. No obfuscated code or hidden data flows detected. Warnings are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs centroid calculations through Gaussian fitting, masking invalid data points, and computing initial parameters via moments. It relies on `astropy` and `numpy`, both standard scientific packages. No suspicious network activity, hidden functions, or malicious code are detected. The code is well-structured and uses common practices for data masking, fitting, and warnings. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic are present. The functions focus solely on data analysis, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of centroiding algorithms for astronomical images, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely processes data, performs model fitting, and returns centroid positions without any suspicious side effects.",
