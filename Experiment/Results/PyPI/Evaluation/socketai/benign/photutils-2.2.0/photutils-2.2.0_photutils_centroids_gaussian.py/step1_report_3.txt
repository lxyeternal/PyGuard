{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate the centroid of sources in 2D astronomical images using Gaussian fitting methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input image data, error arrays, and optional masks; processes these inputs to prepare for Gaussian fitting.",
  "sinks": "Fitting functions and warnings, no clear sinks that handle untrusted external data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Inputs (data, error, mask) are processed and masked, then passed to Gaussian fitting routines; results are centroid coordinates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. Usage of warnings and masked arrays appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries (numpy, astropy) and utility functions for data processing. It masks invalid data points, warns on non-finite values, and performs Gaussian fits to image data to determine centroids. Functions use typical approaches for initial parameter estimation and fitting routines, with no indication of malicious or sabotage behavior. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The code seems consistent with standard astronomical centroiding algorithms, and all third-party libraries are commonly used and trustworthy. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of centroiding algorithms for astronomical images. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. The functions perform standard data masking, error handling, and Gaussian fitting without any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
