{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to calculate the centroid of sources in images by fitting Gaussian models (1D and 2D).",
  "sources": "Data input via function parameters 'data', 'error', and optional 'mask'; internal functions like 'process_quantities' and 'data_properties' read data and metadata; warnings are issued for non-finite data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through warnings about non-finite data; no explicit data transmission, file writes, or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> masked and validated -> Gaussian fitting functions -> centroid coordinates output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of warnings for non-finite data is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious control flow observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and uses well-known models for Gaussian fitting. It processes input arrays with masking and error handling, fitting Gaussian models to data to compute centroids. No hidden or malicious code, no suspicious data handling or network activity. Warnings are standard for invalid data, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The functions appear to perform legitimate centroiding calculations with proper validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of centroiding functions using Gaussian fits. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and includes appropriate input validation and warnings. Overall security risk is very low.",
