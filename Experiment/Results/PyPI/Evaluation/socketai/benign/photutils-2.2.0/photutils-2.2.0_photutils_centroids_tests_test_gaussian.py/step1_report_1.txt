  "purpose": "The code provides test cases for centroiding functions and Gaussian model fitting used in astronomical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads include function parameters, input data arrays, and generated model data. Uses np.mgrid to create coordinate grids, and data from Gaussian models.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or system effects. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input data from model functions flows into centroid calculation functions, with optional masks and errors. No external data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Use of warnings for non-finite data is appropriate for robustness, not malicious intent. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive test suite for centroiding algorithms, utilizing numpy, astropy, and pytest. It tests multiple configurations, including masking, error handling, and warnings for non-finite data. No code performs external communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The test functions are well-structured, and all data handling appears standard for scientific testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is strictly for testing scientific functions related to Gaussian models and centroiding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for scientific centroiding algorithms with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. The security risk is negligible.",
