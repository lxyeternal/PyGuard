{
  "purpose": "The code computes the Gini coefficient of a 2D data array, typically used for measuring light distribution in galaxy images.",
  "sources": "Reads input data array 'data' and optional boolean mask 'mask'.",
  "sinks": "Returns a floating-point Gini coefficient; no sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'data' and 'mask' -> processes array -> sorts values -> computes kernel -> outputs float Gini coefficient.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no hidden network activity, and no unusual dynamic code execution. The code relies solely on numpy for array processing and calculations.",
  "analysis": "The function processes input data and an optional mask, computes the Gini coefficient based on pixel values, and handles edge cases such as zero-sum arrays or NaN values. No external network calls, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears straightforward and mathematically focused without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for calculating the Gini coefficient for galaxy images. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is safe and typical for scientific data analysis purposes.",
