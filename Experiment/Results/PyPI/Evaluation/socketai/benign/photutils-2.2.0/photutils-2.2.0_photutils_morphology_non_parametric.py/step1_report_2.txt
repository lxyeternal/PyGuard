  "purpose": "Calculate the Gini coefficient for a 2D array representing source morphology in astrophysical images.",
  "sources": "Reads input data array 'data' and optional mask 'mask' for pixel exclusion.",
  "sinks": "Performs internal computation; no external data transmission or system modification detected.",
  "flows": "Input data -> masked or unraveled array -> calculation of sorted values and kernel -> sum to produce the Gini coefficient.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function to compute the Gini coefficient, handles optional masking, checks for NaN values, manages normalization to prevent division by zero, and performs a standard calculation based on established formula. No suspicious logic, no data leakage, no malicious side-effects detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a mathematical metric for galaxy morphology analysis. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and performs solely data analysis without external communication or system modifications.",
