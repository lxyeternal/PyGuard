  "purpose": "Calculate the Gini coefficient of a 2D array, used for measuring inequality in galaxy light distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data array 'data', optional mask 'mask' for excluding pixels.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; computations are in-memory, involving numpy array operations.",
  "flows": "Data is masked and flattened, then sorted; the Gini coefficient is computed via a weighted sum of pixel values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, with proper handling of NaNs and zero normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Gini coefficient calculation with appropriate edge case handling. It does not perform any external communication, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The use of numpy ensures efficiency and correctness. No suspicious patterns or security concerns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's nature, though the risk could be confidently set to zero given its simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a scientific calculation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. Minor risk scores of 0.1 are conservative; setting the risk to 0 is justified. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is suitable for use.",
