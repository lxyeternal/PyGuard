  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a scientific calculation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. Minor risk scores of 0.1 are conservative; setting the risk to 0 is justified. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is suitable for use."
