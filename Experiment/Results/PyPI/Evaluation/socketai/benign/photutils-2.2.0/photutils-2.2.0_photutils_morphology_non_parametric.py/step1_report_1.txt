  "purpose": "Provides a function to calculate the Gini coefficient for a 2D array, used for analyzing galaxy morphology in astrophysics.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data' parameter, which is an array-like input representing image pixel values. Optional mask input is used to filter data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include sinks that transmit data over networks, write to files, or interact with system resources. No outputs other than returning a float value.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed locally; no data flows to external systems or network endpoints. The function performs in-memory computation only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No code injection, unsafe evaluations, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly implements a mathematical formula for the Gini coefficient with proper handling of edge cases, such as all NaN values or zero normalization. It utilizes numpy functions for array processing, with optional masking. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks, as the code performs straightforward numerical computation without external communication or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of the Gini coefficient calculation for image data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The function operates solely on in-memory data and does not perform any external actions.",
