  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate the Gini coefficient for 2D data arrays, particularly in the context of galaxy morphology analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input array 'data', and optionally uses a mask array 'mask' to filter data.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical calculations on the data; no direct data output or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'data' (and optionally 'mask') → data processing → calculation of Gini coefficient → output result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or external calls. The code is a standard mathematical calculation with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function 'gini' to compute the Gini coefficient. It handles masked data and cases with NaN values. The calculation involves sorting data, applying a formula, and returning a scalar value. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, file manipulation, or other malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, well-commented, and adheres to standard numerical computation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a mathematical function for data analysis. No malicious intent or malicious code segments are present. It appears safe and purely analytical.",
