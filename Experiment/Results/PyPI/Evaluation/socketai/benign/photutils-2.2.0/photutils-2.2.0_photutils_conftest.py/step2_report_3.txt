  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No issues, safe code, standard configuration.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** The logic is straightforward, with safe imports, conditional configuration, and version setting. No malicious activity or security risk detected.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, confirms safe, standard code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** No suspicious behavior, no external network calls, no data leaks.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard pytest configuration with version info.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is safe and typical for test setup.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), but no actual malicious activity detected.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (possibly overestimating)  \n- **Comments:** The code still appears safe; the small risk score might reflect a conservative approach or minor concern but no concrete evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard configuration, no issues.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n- **Comments:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  The code is a standard pytest configuration script. It performs safe, common operations: conditional import, setting configuration options, updating version info. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws:**  \n  No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident. The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The security risk score in report 4 is slightly elevated (0.1), but given the absence of any suspicious activity, this seems overly cautious. I would consider it more appropriate to assign a risk score of 0 unless there are external factors not evident here.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  Both are correctly scored as 0. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n  The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution that could introduce vulnerabilities. The import of optional modules is safe, and version setting is benign.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (more appropriate than 0.1, given the evidence)\n\nThis code is a benign, standard test configuration script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the analysis confirms that the code is safe and free from malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk score in one report should be adjusted to zero for accuracy.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or specific focus is needed.",
