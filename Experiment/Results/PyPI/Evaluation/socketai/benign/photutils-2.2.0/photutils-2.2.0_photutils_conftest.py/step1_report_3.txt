  "purpose": "Configure pytest test suite settings and customize header display for package versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest_astropy_header modules, local import of photutils.__version__",
  "sinks": "Assignment to config.option.astropy_header, modification of PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES, setting TESTED_VERSIONS['photutils']",
  "flows": "Import modules -> set ASTROPY_HEADER flag -> configure pytest headers with package info -> assign photutils version",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with an import attempt that conditionally sets a flag based on availability of pytest_astropy_header. It then defines a configuration function that, if the header package is available, modifies the pytest configuration object to display package versions. The code explicitly sets version info for photutils by importing its __version__ attribute. All operations are standard configuration procedures with no suspicious activities, external network calls, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard configuration for pytest testing environments, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
