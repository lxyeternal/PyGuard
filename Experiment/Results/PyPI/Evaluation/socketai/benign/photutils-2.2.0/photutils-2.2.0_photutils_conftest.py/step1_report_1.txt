{
  "purpose": "This code configures the pytest test suite, particularly managing the display of header information for various dependencies during testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'pytest_astropy_header.display' module, imports the '__version__' attribute from 'photutils', and accesses 'config.option' in the 'pytest_configure' function.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies 'config.option' and updates the 'PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES' and 'TESTED_VERSIONS' dictionaries, which influence test output but do not affect system state or data flow outside testing.",
  "flows": "Imports from 'pytest_astropy_header.display' influence test header display; 'photutils.__version__' is stored in 'TESTED_VERSIONS'; modifications to 'PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES' affect header content during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures are present. The code performs standard configuration tasks with safe imports and variable manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code safely attempts to import optional modules, sets a flag based on import success, and modifies test configuration options if available. It reads the version from 'photutils' and updates test version info accordingly. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code operates solely within testing configuration scope.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard test setup code for configuring pytest header display with dependency versions. It does not contain malware or security risks. The logic is straightforward and uses safe practices.",
