{
  "purpose": "This code configures the pytest testing framework for a project, customizing test output and including version information for dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statements (pytest_astropy_header.display and photutils.__version__) and configuration object (config.option).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations. The code only manipulates configuration variables and version info.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves conditional import and setting configuration options based on available modules; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The list of dependencies appears standard and relevant for scientific testing.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts a safe conditional import of a module, sets configuration options if available, clears and populates a dictionary with known packages, and retrieves version info for photutils. All operations are standard for test setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate configuration script for pytest, designed to enhance test output with dependency version info. It shows no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
