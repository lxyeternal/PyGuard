  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; configuration and import statements are safe",
  "flows": "Import of external package, setting config options based on import success, updating version info",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific modules and set configuration options accordingly. It conditionally enables header display and updates version info for photutils. All actions are standard for a test configuration file. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for pytest, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
