  "sources": "Import statements for pytest_astropy_header.display, __version__ from photutils.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to config.option.astropy_header, modification of PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES, update of TESTED_VERSIONS.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ -> assignment to TESTED_VERSIONS; setting config.option.astropy_header -> manipulation of module display settings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard configuration pattern with conditional import handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import optional modules for enhanced testing headers; if available, it configures pytest to display package versions, including a specific version from photutils. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are used in a way that could cause harm. No obfuscated code or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical pytest configuration script that conditionally enhances test output with package version info. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack signs, or security risks are present.",
