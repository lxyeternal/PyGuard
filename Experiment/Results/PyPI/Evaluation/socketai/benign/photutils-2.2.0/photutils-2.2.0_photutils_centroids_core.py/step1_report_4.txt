{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating source centroids in astronomical images, including center of mass, quadratic polynomial fit, and source position estimation from cutouts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (data, mask, footprint, error, xpos, ypos), and parameters for centroid calculations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present; the code performs local computations only.",
  "flows": "Reads data and mask -> processes data (masking, finite checks) -> calculates centroids -> returns centroid coordinates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of warnings instead of exceptions for some failures. No suspicious data exfiltration or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard centroiding algorithms with input validation, masking, and polynomial fitting. It performs calculations locally without external data or network connections. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, remote communication, or system manipulation are observed. Use of warnings for non-critical failures is typical for scientific code. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The logic is consistent with expected centroiding routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of centroiding methods for astronomical image analysis with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs local data processing without external communication or hidden behaviors.",
