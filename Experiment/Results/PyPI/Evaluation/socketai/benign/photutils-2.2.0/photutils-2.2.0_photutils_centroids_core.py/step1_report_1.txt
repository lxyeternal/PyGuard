  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate source centroids in astronomical images, including centroiding algorithms and utilities for source position refinement.",
  "sources": "Reads input image data (arrays), optional masks, initial position guesses, and parameters for centroiding methods. Uses data from numpy arrays, input parameters, and internal function calls.",
  "sinks": "Returns centroid coordinates as numpy arrays. No data leaks or untrusted data effects observed. No file or network operations, no credential handling, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (image arrays, masks, initial guesses) flow into centroid functions; centroid algorithms process this data; results (coordinate arrays) flow out. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies on standard numpy operations and common scientific algorithms. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present. No external communications or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple centroiding functions (center of mass, quadratic fit, source batch processing) using well-known numerical methods. Input data handling includes masking, finite value checks, and region selection. The functions perform standard mathematical operations for centroid estimation, with error handling and warnings for edge cases. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage activities are present. The code is primarily computational and data processing, with no suspicious external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard scientific image centroiding module without any malicious behavior or security risks. It performs legitimate calculations for astronomical data analysis and contains no indications of sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
