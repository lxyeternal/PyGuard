{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for centroiding sources in astronomical images, including calculations based on moments, quadratic fitting, and source positions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays, optional masks, and parameters such as initial positions and box sizes; accesses numpy and astropy utilities.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to unvalidated input data affecting calculations, but no evident unsafe data sinks like network communication, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input arrays, processed through centroiding algorithms, with flow from source data/masks to centroid calculations; no external data flows or outputs observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or unusual code structures, no hidden or suspicious behavior; standard mathematical and array operations are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard centroiding algorithms relying on numpy and astropy. Input data is copied and validated; no external system commands or network operations are present. The centroid_com function computes a weighted mean of non-finite masked data. centroid_quadratic fits a 2D quadratic polynomial to data to find maxima; proper handling of edge cases and NaNs is included. centroid_sources extracts cutouts based on position and footprint, then applies centroid functions with proper masking and boundary checks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external data sinks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate centroiding calculations for astronomical data without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured and uses standard libraries safely. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
