  "conclusion": "The functions are legitimate, standard implementations for centroiding with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The only minor security consideration is the user-supplied centroid_func, which could be malicious if misused, but this is an expected extension point rather than a vulnerability. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for scientific use."
