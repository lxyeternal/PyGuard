  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` for an open-source package, with version handling and citation retrieval.\n- It attempts to import a version string from `.version`.\n- It defines a function `_get_bibtex()` that reads a citation from a `CITATION.rst` file located in the same directory.\n- The function reads the file, splits on '@software', and constructs a citation string.\n- The citation string is assigned to `__citation__` and `__bibtex__`.\n- The function `_get_bibtex` is then deleted from the namespace.\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**\n\n- The code appears straightforward and typical for such packages.\n- There are no obvious security vulnerabilities, such as code injection or malicious file access.\n- The file reading is simple, with no user input involved, so no injection risk.\n- The code relies on the existence of `CITATION.rst`. If missing, `__citation__` and `__bibtex__` will be empty strings, which is acceptable.\n- No malware or obfuscation present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code does not contain any malicious or vulnerable constructs. It performs version import and citation extraction in a standard way.\n\n---\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n\n- All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content.\n- No actual analysis, findings, or evidence are provided.\n- The reports do not specify any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n\n**Implication:**  \nSince all reports are empty, there's no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or other issues.\n\n---\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content, the malware score should be **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated. Score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Without any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n**If any report claimed otherwise, I would challenge it, but here, the reports are empty.**\n\n---\n\n4. **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is safe, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The empty reports do not provide any grounds for concern.\n- The scores should reflect the absence of issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Note:** If future reports provide concrete evidence or findings, reassessment would be necessary. As it stands, the code and reports indicate no issues.",
