{
  "purpose": "The code initializes version information and retrieves a citation reference from a local file for the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'CITATION.rst' file in the same directory to extract citation info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or user input involved.",
  "flows": "Reads the citation file, splits content on '@software', and assigns the result to module variables.",
  "anomalies": "Minor inconsistency in variable naming (__bibtex__ vs __citation__), but no malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard file reading and variable assignment. No suspicious or malicious code detected. The citation extraction relies on the presence and format of 'CITATION.rst', but this is typical for such modules. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The only minor flaw is the potential confusion due to variable naming, but it does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is a minor variable naming inconsistency, which does not affect security. The empty reports lack details but do not contradict this assessment.",
