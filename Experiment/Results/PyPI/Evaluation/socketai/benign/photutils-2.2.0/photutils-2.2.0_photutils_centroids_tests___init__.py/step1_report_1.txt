  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing and possibly communicate with external services, but without seeing the actual code, the intent cannot be definitively established.",
  "sources": "Data is likely read from user input, environment variables, or external files (if present). Specific source points cannot be identified without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands if invoked, but specific points are unclear without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks typically involves data validation or transformation steps; however, detailed source-to-sink paths cannot be determined without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without examining the code content. Absence of hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns is uncertain due to lack of code visibility.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis without actual code content. Need to evaluate for suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, unsafe operations, or obfuscated code segments. Currently, no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or security issues can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, no definitive malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The review cannot be completed accurately without analyzing actual source code.",
