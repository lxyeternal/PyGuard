  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on report descriptions and minimal code snippets.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks identified; no suspicious data flows or external connections indicated.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detectable due to lack of code or detailed behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed; reports note minimal or no code.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or minimal nature of code, with scores reflecting no malicious activity. Report 2's confidence score is inconsistent; with no code, it should be near zero. Other reports' scores are appropriate given their descriptions. Malware scores are zero across all, aligning with no evidence of malicious intent. Obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the lack of obfuscation. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), indicating minimal concern. Adjustments mainly involve lowering confidence in reports with no code, especially Report 2.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation in the dependency. The scores are generally appropriate, with the main correction being reducing Report 2's confidence from 1.0 to near zero due to lack of code. The supply chain appears secure based on available information.",
