  "purpose": "This subpackage provides tools for centroiding sources, likely in an astronomical or image processing context.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from '.core' and '.gaussian'. No external input or data reading occurs in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is evident; the code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .module import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module import statement, establishing a subpackage for centroiding tools. It does not contain any data input, network communication, or executable logic that could be malicious. The license comment is standard and provides licensing information. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of documentation and module import statements with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not pose security risks.",
