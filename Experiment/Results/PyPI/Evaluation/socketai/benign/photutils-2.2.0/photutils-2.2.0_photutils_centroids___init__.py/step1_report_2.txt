  "purpose": "This subpackage provides tools for centroiding sources in astronomical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from .core and .gaussian modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows; simply imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can hide imported functions or variables; no other suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file with licensing comment and module imports. It does not process data directly, nor does it contain code that executes untrusted input. The use of wildcard imports might obscure imported functions, but this is common in package initialization and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports modules related to centroiding tools. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
