{
  "purpose": "The code provides tools for centroiding sources, likely in an astronomical or image analysis context, as part of a subpackage.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core and .gaussian). No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network, file, or system command executions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which can obscure imported content, but this is common in package __init__.py files and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment, a docstring describing the subpackage, and two wildcard imports from internal modules. There are no visible data input sources, no processing logic, and no sinks or data transmissions. The wildcard imports could hide potentially malicious code, but given the context, they are standard for package initialization files. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. Overall, this code is a typical package stub with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely imports internal modules for further use. No anomalies, malware, or security issues are evident.",
