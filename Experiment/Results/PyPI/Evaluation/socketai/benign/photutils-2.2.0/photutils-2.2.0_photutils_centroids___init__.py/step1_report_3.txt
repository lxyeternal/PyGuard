{
  "purpose": "Contains tools for centroiding sources, likely related to image processing or astronomical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports all functions and classes from 'core' and 'gaussian' modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow or untrusted data source to sink identified in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure dependencies and potential malicious code. No license or licensing-related anomalies. No code execution or hidden behaviors visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comment and import statements from internal modules. The imports do not specify specific functions or classes, which is a common pattern in package initialization but can obscure which parts are used. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The wildcard imports are standard in some package init files but can hinder security auditing; however, they do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. No external network activity, system modifications, or other malicious indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file, primarily importing internal modules for public use. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
