  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports analyze the same code snippet: a package __init__.py with license comment and wildcard imports from internal modules.\n- No actual code execution, data handling, or external communication is present.\n- Wildcard imports are common in package initialization but can obscure dependencies.\n- No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are identified in any report.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes the package as tools for centroiding sources.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; only imports.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; use of wildcard import can hide malicious code but is common.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Reasonable; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n  \n**Comment:** The securityRisk score is minimal, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly different wording.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Comment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Similar analysis, with a slightly lower confidence (0.8).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Comment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, perhaps due to the general caution about wildcard imports. Still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Slightly more conservative confidence (1), securityRisk=0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comment:** Justified; no security risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Similar to previous, with high confidence and zero risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment**\n\n- **Code presence:** No, the code is a simple package initializer with imports.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code or behavior in any report.\n- **Obfuscated code:** None; wildcard imports are common in package init files.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### **Final recommendations**\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is **0**, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk is minimal, mostly related to the use of wildcard imports, which is standard but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Reasoning                                                  |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | 0, no malicious activity or code present.                  |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0, code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                |\n| **Risk**       | 0.1 to 0.2, primarily due to wildcard imports which can hide dependencies but are common in package init files. |\n\n**Final note:** The code snippet is benign, and the current scoring in the reports aligns well with the actual content.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware detected.",
