  "purpose": "This subpackage provides tools for centroiding sources, likely in an astronomical or image analysis context.",
  "sources": "Import statements for submodules 'core' and 'gaussian' within the package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports from submodules, which may contain data processing or computations, but no direct flow evident here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure actual imported functions or variables, potentially hiding malicious code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a package-level module that imports all contents from submodules 'core' and 'gaussian'. The license comment indicates open-source licensing. The use of wildcard imports is common but discouraged for clarity and maintainability; it can hide malicious code if present in submodules, but in itself, it is not malicious. No suspicious code, data handling, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initializer with open-source license and broad imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment.",
