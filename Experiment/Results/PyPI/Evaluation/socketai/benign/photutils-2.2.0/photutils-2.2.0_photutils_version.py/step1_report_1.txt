  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for internal version management and type checking.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and version tuple; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential points where untrusted data influences the system or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and consistent with standard version management patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version variables, including a version string and a version tuple, with conditional type checking imports. It avoids any dynamic or external data inputs, and there are no suspicious code behaviors. The comments indicate the file is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, a common version control tool, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version management snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply assigns static version information for package metadata.",
