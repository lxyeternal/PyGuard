{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm, facilitating version management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, static version string and tuple declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data usage identified.",
  "flows": "Static version string assignment to variables, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version metadata for a package, including a version string and tuple. It uses a conditional to differentiate typing information from runtime variables, but all data is hardcoded. There are no external inputs, no code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version definition for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks.",
