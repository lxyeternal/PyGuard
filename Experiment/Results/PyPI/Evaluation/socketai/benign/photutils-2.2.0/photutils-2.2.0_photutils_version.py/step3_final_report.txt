{
  "purpose": "Defines static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic or external data involved.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string and tuple assignments; conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static version info snippet with conditional type checking import. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples without external input, dynamic code, or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The code's simplicity and static nature imply no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version management snippet with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
