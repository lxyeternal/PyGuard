  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a static, auto-generated version management snippet for a Python package.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The scores assigned are all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code only assigns static version information and performs a conditional import for type checking.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Confirmed:** No issues are present.\n\n#### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated, and standard.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- **Confirmed:** No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n#### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Suggestion:** No change needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n#### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n- Since all scores are zero, no justification is needed.\n- If any report had assigned higher scores, I would scrutinize whether there was any hidden malicious intent or dynamic behavior, which there isn't.\n\n#### 5. **Malware Score**\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Confirmed:** Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n#### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- All reports are based on observable static code analysis.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made.\n- **Confirmed:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n\n#### 7. **Score Consistency**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The code's benign nature justifies the zero scores across the board.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info snippet.\n- No external inputs, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.\n- All evidence points to a benign, non-malicious, and low-risk snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as having no security risks or malware. I concur with their assessments. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk. The code is safe and standard.",
