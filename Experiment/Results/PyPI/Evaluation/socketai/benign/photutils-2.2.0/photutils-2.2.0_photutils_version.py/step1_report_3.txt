{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version management and type checking purposes.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and '__version_tuple__' are set directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only assigns and defines version variables.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned directly to variables, with no external data flow or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code contains static assignments of version information and type annotations for type checking. There are no external data inputs or outputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file system interactions. The code appears to be boilerplate for package versioning purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard versioning boilerplate generated by setuptools_scm with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs static assignments without external input or suspicious operations. Overall security risk is negligible.",
