  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using setuptools_scm-generated code.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, reading version string literal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Literal string assignment to version variables; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for version definition with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables for a Python package, using a common pattern. It includes a conditional import for type checking, which does not execute at runtime, and assigns version info as a string and tuple. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be auto-generated and standard for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
