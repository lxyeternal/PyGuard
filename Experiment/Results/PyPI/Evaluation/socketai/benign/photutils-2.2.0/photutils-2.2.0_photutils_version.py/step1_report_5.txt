  "purpose": "Define version information and types for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables, and import statements within TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to variables, no external data flow or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard version variable definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables and types for a package. It imports typing only during type checking, which is standard practice. The version string and tuple are hardcoded with static values. No external data input, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be boilerplate for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages version information for a package.",
