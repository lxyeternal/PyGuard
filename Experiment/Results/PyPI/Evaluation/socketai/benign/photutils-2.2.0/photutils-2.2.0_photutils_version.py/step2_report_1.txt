  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report in turn, verifying the actual code, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version management snippet created by setuptools_scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples.\n- There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code includes a typical `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional for type annotations, which is standard practice.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines version info, generated by setuptools_scm, with static assignments.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no suspicious behavior, benign code.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0` — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Same observations as Report 1; identical reasoning applies.\n- Correctly notes static assignment, no external input, no malicious intent.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same as above; the code is boilerplate version info.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar to previous reports; straightforward static assignment.\n- No external data or dynamic behavior.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same reasoning; standard versioning boilerplate.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and benign.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** Scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, as there's no external input, dynamic code, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1 in all reports, justified.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, boilerplate version info snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and correct. No changes needed.",
