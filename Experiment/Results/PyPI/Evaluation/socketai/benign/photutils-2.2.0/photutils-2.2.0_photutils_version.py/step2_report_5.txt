  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the provided code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static version definition generated by setuptools_scm.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code uses standard patterns for version management and type checking.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states that the code defines version info for internal use.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; code is benign, auto-generated, with no malicious intent.\n- **Score:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0 — all reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static assignment and standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct, no issues.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Reiterates that the code is static, boilerplate, with no external data or dynamic behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Also aligns with previous assessments, emphasizing static, straightforward version info.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or risks.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Highlights the use of type checking and static assignment.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking with the code:\n- The code is purely static, with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n- The only potential concern could be if the version string was manipulated or fetched dynamically, but here it is hardcoded as `'2.2.0'`.\n- The type checking import is standard and only active during type checking, not runtime.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious code constructs.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — static, benign version info, no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a typical, auto-generated version management snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis above.",
