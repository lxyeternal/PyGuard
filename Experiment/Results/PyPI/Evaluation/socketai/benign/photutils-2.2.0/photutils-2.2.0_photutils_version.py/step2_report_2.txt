  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version management snippet created by setuptools_scm.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and contains no external inputs or dynamic behaviors.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected in the code.\n- The version string and tuple are hardcoded, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is benign, auto-generated, and purely for internal version management.\n- **Scores:** All zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Also accurate; the code is standard and contains no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Zero scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is boilerplate, static, and safe.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the others; no external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Zero scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the clear, static code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Overall, the analysis and scoring are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.**\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, static, and well-formed.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign.
