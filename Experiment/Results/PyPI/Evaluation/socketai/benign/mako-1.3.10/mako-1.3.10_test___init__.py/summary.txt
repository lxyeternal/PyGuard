  "malware_score": 0.4,
  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.5,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with some reports indicating potential malicious features such as eval/exec and obfuscation. The current scores are justified; the highest suspicion remains with report 2. Continuous monitoring and further dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm malicious intent if network activity or code obfuscation are confirmed."
