{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility classes for generating Python code with proper indentation and whitespace adjustment, mainly for testing code generation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include static string blocks (e.g., variable 'block') and method parameters such as lines of code or code blocks passed to write_indented_block. No external input or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Sinks are primarily output streams via StringIO, where generated code is written. No untrusted data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks. No data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The code reads static code snippets from string variables and writes formatted code into StringIO streams. There are no data flows from external sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code performs straightforward code formatting and testing utilities. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for testing and formatting Python code snippets, including methods for generating code with proper indentation and whitespace adjustment. The methods operate on static string data and output formatted code. No external inputs, network operations, or data manipulations suggest malicious intent. The use of StringIO and simple string assertions indicates testing and code generation functionalities without any malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be benign utility code designed for testing Python code generation and formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manipulates static code snippets and outputs formatted code for testing purposes.",
