{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for testing Python code generation and whitespace adjustment functions, including various formatting scenarios.",
  "sources": "Input data includes string literals, code blocks, and test cases from within the methods, mainly static string data.",
  "sinks": "Output is primarily to StringIO streams; no untrusted external data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings through formatting and whitespace adjustment functions, then into StringIO streams, with no external data or network communication involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code constructs, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns. No obfuscated code, external network interactions, or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for testing Python code generation and whitespace adjustments. All input data are static test strings, and output is directed to in-memory streams. No external inputs, network access, or sensitive data handling is observed. The functions perform formatting and code generation tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The code adheres to normal testing practices and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing suite focused on code formatting and generation, with no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
