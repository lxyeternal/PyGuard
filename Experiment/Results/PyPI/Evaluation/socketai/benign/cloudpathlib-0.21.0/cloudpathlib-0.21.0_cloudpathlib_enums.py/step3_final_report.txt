  "purpose": "Defines an Enum for cache modes and provides a method to parse an environment variable into this Enum.",
  "sources": "Reads the environment variable 'CLOUDPATHLIB_FILE_CACHE_MODE' using os.environ.get().",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or leaked outside the process.",
  "flows": "Environment variable value flows from os.environ.get() to Enum instantiation in from_environment().",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment variable parsing and Enum definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a clear Enum class representing cache modes with descriptive docstrings. The class method from_environment() safely reads an environment variable, converts it to lowercase, and attempts to instantiate the Enum. The logic is simple, uses standard library functions, and contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious data flows. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The only minor concern is that if the environment variable contains an invalid value, a ValueError would be raised, but this is typical behavior and not a security issue. Overall, the code is a benign configuration utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for environment-based configuration. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment variable parsing is straightforward and secure. The existing scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1) reflecting the minimal risk involved. No modifications are necessary.",
