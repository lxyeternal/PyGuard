  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different cache modes used in the cloudpathlib library, including environment variable parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'CLOUDPATHLIB_FILE_CACHE_MODE' via os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "Uses the environment variable value to instantiate Enum; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'CLOUDPATHLIB_FILE_CACHE_MODE' -> env_string -> Enum instantiation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with descriptive attributes for cache modes. It includes a class method to parse a specific environment variable, converting it to lowercase and returning the corresponding Enum value if it exists. The code relies on standard library functions and does not perform any unsafe operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an Enum with environment variable parsing, without any malicious intent or security risks identified.",
