  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for environment-based configuration. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The environment variable parsing is straightforward and secure. The existing scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1) reflecting the minimal risk involved. No modifications are necessary."
