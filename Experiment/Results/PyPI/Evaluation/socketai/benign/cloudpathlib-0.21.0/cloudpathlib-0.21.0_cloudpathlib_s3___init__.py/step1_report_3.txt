  "purpose": "Define public API exports for S3-related classes in a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for S3Client and S3Path modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules and exports them via __all__ for public use. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious code constructs. The code serves as a simple module interface declaration, with no runtime logic, input handling, or external data communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
