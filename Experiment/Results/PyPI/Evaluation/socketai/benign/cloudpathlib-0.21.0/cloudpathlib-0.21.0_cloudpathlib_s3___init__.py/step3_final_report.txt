{
  "purpose": "Module exports two classes, S3Client and S3Path, for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .s3client and .s3path",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static import/export statements only",
  "flows": "Import statements -> __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module that imports two classes and declares __all__ for exports. No functions, network calls, dynamic execution, or embedded secrets are present. The code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious patterns indicate a benign, standard pattern for Python package interfaces. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are observed. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module export pattern with no security risks or malicious intent. All signals point to a safe, standard implementation.",
