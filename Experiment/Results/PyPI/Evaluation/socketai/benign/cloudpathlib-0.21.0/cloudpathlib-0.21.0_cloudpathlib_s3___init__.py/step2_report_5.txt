  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module export snippet, importing two classes and exposing them via `__all__`.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, network activity, or any dynamic or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any embedded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious operations.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1. This is reasonable because, even if the code itself is safe, the act of exporting modules in a package could be a vector if the modules imported are malicious, but since the imports are local modules, the risk is minimal.\n   - The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a high risk score.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - The minimal risk score of 0.1 in one report is acceptable, considering the potential for malicious modules, but in this case, it's negligible.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n   - The code is purely for module export, with no embedded malicious logic.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's structure and behavior.\n   - They do not infer vulnerabilities where none exist.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are low or zero, matching the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (appropriate, given the code's simplicity and safety)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, harmless module export snippet with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the evidence provided.",
