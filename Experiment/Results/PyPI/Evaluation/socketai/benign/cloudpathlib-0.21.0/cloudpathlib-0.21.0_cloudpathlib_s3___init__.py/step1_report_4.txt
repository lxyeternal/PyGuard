{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports for S3Client and S3Path classes, likely part of an S3 storage utility library.",
  "sources": "Imports S3Client from .s3client and S3Path from .s3path within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present, as the code only exports classes without executing untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just module export setup.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code that reads input, handles untrusted data, or performs operations; no suspicious or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely sets up module exports by importing two classes and defining __all__. No data processing, no input handling, and no dynamic or risky code execution. It appears to be standard module initialization code for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as an export interface for other components.",
