{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package module by importing various cloud storage path and client modules, retrieves the package version dynamically, and defines the public API exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, version retrieval via importlib_metadata, no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static imports and version retrieval are safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version setup, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of internal modules, conditionally imports importlib.metadata for version info, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated logic. The version is obtained via standard package metadata. Overall, it is a typical, benign module initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all zero or minimal, consistent with the code's nature.",
