{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various classes and functions related to cloud storage paths and clients, setting up module metadata and exposing certain classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Reading import statements, module version retrieval via importlib_metadata, sys.version_info for Python version check",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data, no network connections, no file operations, no execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no runtime data flows or dynamic code execution are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The version is fetched dynamically, which is standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static imports from local modules and conditional import of importlib.metadata based on Python version. It retrieves the package version using importlib_metadata.version(). No data is read from or written to external sources at runtime. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical module setup with import statements and metadata retrieval. It shows no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is clean and follows standard Python practices.",
