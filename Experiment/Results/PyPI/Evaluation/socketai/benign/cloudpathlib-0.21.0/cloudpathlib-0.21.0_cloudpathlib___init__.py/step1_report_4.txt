{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes related to cloud storage paths and clients, and defines the package version and exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.anypath, .azure.azblobclient, etc.) and version retrieval via importlib_metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing occurs; no handling of untrusted input or data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; mainly module imports and attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version retrieval, and defining __all__. It imports various cloud storage classes and paths, and sets module exports. There are no input reading, data processing, or network communications. The use of importlib_metadata conditionally for Python version compatibility is standard. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module initialization code that imports and exports cloud storage components without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It poses no security risk.",
