  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard module setup, performing imports, version retrieval, and defining exports.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The use of conditional import for importlib.metadata is standard for compatibility across Python versions.\n- The package version is retrieved via importlib_metadata, which is a common practice.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only minor point is the retrieval of package version via `importlib_metadata.version()`. If an attacker had compromised the package metadata, this could be exploited, but this is a standard practice and generally considered safe.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent is present.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified, as there's no malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical module initialization script for a Python package.\n- It performs no risky operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted input.\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with an assessment of no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard module setup)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
