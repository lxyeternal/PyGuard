{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various classes and functions related to cloud storage paths and clients, and sets up versioning and export variables.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal package modules (anypath, azure, cloudpath, s3, gs) and version information via importlib_metadata",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or network communications are present",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns exported variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The use of importlib_metadata conditional import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports, conditional import based on Python version, and defines exports and version info. No suspicious or malicious constructs are detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. It strictly adheres to conventional module setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
