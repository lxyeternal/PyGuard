{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the cloudpathlib library to facilitate error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures, no external data input or output observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data propagation; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions extending standard Python exception classes, serving as a custom error handling framework for the cloudpathlib library. There are no data inputs, outputs, network interactions, or code execution logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The structure adheres to Python conventions and appears to be purely for error categorization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as exception class definitions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
