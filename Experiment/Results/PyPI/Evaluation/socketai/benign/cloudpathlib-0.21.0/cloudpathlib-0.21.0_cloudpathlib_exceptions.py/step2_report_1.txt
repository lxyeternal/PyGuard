  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling within the library.\n- The code is straightforward, adhering to Python conventions, and appears benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are zero, as no vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0.0 or 0.5, with the highest being 0.5, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- No issues are detected in the code itself.\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is purely for exception handling.\n\n**Suggestions for score adjustments:**\n- Since all evidence points to a benign, static exception class module, the **malware score should remain at 0**.\n- The **obfuscated score should stay at 0**.\n- The **security risk score should be 0**.\n- The **risk score** is already low (0.0 or 0.5). Given the lack of any suspicious activity, a score of **0.0** seems most appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The current scores are reasonable, but to reflect the absolute safety, I would set:\n  - **Malware score: 0**\n  - **Obfuscated score: 0**\n  - **Risk score: 0**\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes serving error handling purposes.\n- No security concerns are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- Scores are appropriate but could be slightly lowered to reflect the absolute safety.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the code is safe and non-malicious.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to prepare a formal summary or further analysis.",
