  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely a set of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or data handling is present.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, serving as error categorization within the library.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and intended for error handling.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a 0, indicating no security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns**:\n   - No issues are identified in the code or the reasoning.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the purpose and security posture of the code.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**\n   - The scores seem appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the code's nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code segment is safe, well-structured, and serves a clear purpose within the library. No further action or concern is warranted.",
