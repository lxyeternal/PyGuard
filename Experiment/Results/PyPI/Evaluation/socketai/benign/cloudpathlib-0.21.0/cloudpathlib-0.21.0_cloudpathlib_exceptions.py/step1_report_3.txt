  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the cloudpathlib library to handle various error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no effect or data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; only standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exception types. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The structure is straightforward, and all classes serve as exception types for error handling within the library. There are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious code. The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in the library. Overall, it is safe and does not pose a security threat.",
