  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the cloudpathlib library to facilitate error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance statements; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; code only defines exception classes with inheritance, no data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exceptions for error handling in the cloudpathlib library. It uses standard Python exception inheritance, combining base exception classes with more specific ones. There are no external input reads, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or sensitive data handling. The classes are simple and serve as error types, indicating no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a normal, static error class module with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions intended for structured error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and poses no security risks. It is a benign, well-structured error class module.",
