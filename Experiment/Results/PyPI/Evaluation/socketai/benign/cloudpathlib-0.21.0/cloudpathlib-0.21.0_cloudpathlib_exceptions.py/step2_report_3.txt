  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no indications of embedded malicious code, data leaks, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, serving as structured error types for the library.\n   - No external data input/output, network activity, or code execution logic is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely static class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n   - They consistently note the absence of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or security risks.\n   - No misinterpretations or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree the code is purely for error handling with no malicious intent, a high risk score (>0.5) would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities or hidden malicious behaviors.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risks identified)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided reports. The code is a benign, static set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose for error handling within the library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
