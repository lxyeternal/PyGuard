{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the cloudpathlib library to facilitate error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static class definitions with inheritance only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard exceptions or a base class. There are no dynamic behaviors, network activities, or data manipulations. The code is static, clear, and serves error categorization purposes. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a structured set of exception classes for error handling within the library. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.",
