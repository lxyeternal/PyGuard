{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the cloudpathlib library to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance declarations; no external data input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data, no potential data leaks or harmful actions detected.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns; the code strictly defines exception classes without malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises only class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions. No input, network activity, or dynamic execution present. No suspicious logic or obfuscation detected. The purpose is purely to structure exceptions for the library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling within the library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.",
