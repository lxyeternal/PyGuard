{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the cloudpathlib library to handle specific error conditions related to cloud path operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures; no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes exception class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions, which are standard in Python for error handling. It uses inheritance to categorize different error types, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent, and no code manipulation or secret handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for a Python library. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
