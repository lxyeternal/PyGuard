  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code solely defines custom exception classes for the `cloudpathlib` library.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network interactions, dynamic code execution, or any operational logic.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, serving purely as error categorization.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and adheres to Python conventions for exception class definitions.\n   - No anomalies, unusual constructs, or signs of malicious intent are detected.\n\n3. **Security Risks and Malware Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk score is also 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Score Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores given (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies**:\n   - No issues are found in the logic, reasoning, or summary of the reports.\n   - The code is not obfuscated, nor does it contain any signs of malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, the likelihood of security vulnerabilities is minimal.\n   - The purpose is clear and limited to error handling, with no hidden or malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score**: Should remain at **0**, as there are no security concerns.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: I agree with the provided scores. No changes are necessary.",
