  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for path handling with validation support. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The external dependency 'path_from_fileurl' could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence suggests so here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2) due to external URL parsing. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified."
