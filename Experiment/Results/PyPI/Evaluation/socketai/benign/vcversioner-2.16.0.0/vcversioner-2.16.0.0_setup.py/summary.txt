  "conclusion": "The script is benign and standard for Python package setup. The main security consideration is the integrity of the 'vcversioner' module. If that module is secure, the package is safe. The malware score is 0; the risk is primarily due to dependency trust, estimated around 0.2-0.3, but given the code's clarity, a conservative estimate is approximately 0.2."
