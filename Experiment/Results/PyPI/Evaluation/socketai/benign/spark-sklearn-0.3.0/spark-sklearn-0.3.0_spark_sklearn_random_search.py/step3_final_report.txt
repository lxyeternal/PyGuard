  "purpose": "A subclass of SparkBaseSearchCV implementing distributed randomized hyperparameter search using scikit-learn's ParameterSampler.",
  "sources": "ParameterSampler generates random parameter configurations; data inputs X, y, groups; internal Spark and scikit-learn components.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or file writes; data flows from input parameters into internal methods and Spark execution.",
  "flows": "ParameterSampler produces parameter sets -> _fit method executes Spark-based search -> results stored in cv_results_.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard extension of scikit-learn's hyperparameter search, integrated with Spark for parallel execution. It uses well-known libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The data flow is confined within the process, with no external communication or data leaks. The security risk primarily stems from distributed execution complexity, but no actual malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of distributed hyperparameter tuning with Spark. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal caution due to distributed environment complexity.",
