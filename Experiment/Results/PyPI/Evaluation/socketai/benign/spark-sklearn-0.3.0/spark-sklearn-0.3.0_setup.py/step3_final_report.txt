  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'spark_sklearn' Python module, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, importing modules, and package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reading README file, setting package info, no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'rb' mode with 'utf-8' encoding in 'codecs.open', which is unconventional but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It imports common modules, defines package metadata, and reads a README file with a minor inconsistency in file opening mode. No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The minor anomaly does not introduce security risks. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with malware scores at 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1). The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The slight risk score reflects the unconventional file open mode but is not indicative of any threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The minor anomaly in file handling is harmless. All assessments are accurate; the malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and risk score appropriately low (~0.1).",
