  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- Notes the inconsistent use of 'rb' mode with 'utf-8' encoding, which is benign.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low)\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The minor inconsistency in file opening mode is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms the code is a typical setup script.\n- Also notes the 'rb' mode with 'utf-8' encoding, but considers it not malicious.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior. The small security risk is due to the minor anomaly, but it's not harmful.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the standard nature of the script.\n- Same anomaly in 'rb' mode with encoding='utf-8'.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings; standard setup script.\n- Same anomaly noted.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms the script is typical, with no suspicious activity.\n- Same anomaly in file opening mode.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware:** All reports agree there is no malicious code or behavior. The malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is present; all code is straightforward. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The only noted anomaly is the inconsistent use of 'rb' mode with encoding='utf-8', which is benign. Therefore, the overall security risk remains very low, around **0.1**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module.\n- No network activity, code injection, or suspicious logic.\n- The minor anomaly in file opening mode is a common oversight, not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1**\n\nThis aligns with the consensus across all reports and the detailed analysis.",
