  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'spark_sklearn' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the contents of README.rst file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication points.",
  "flows": "Read function reads local file content; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The read function opens files with 'rb' mode but specifies encoding='utf-8', which is inconsistent but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and a utility function to read a file's contents. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The use of codecs.open with 'rb' mode alongside encoding='utf-8' is unusual but not harmful; it's likely an oversight or compatibility choice.\n\nThe code lacks network activity, external data fetching, or any obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information are detected. All functions and variables serve straightforward purposes related to packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
