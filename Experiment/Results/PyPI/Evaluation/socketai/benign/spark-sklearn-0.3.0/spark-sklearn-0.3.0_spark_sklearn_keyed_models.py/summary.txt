  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious code or sabotage; the primary security issue is the use of pickle, which is a known vulnerability if models are untrusted. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated is 0, and the risk score should be around 0.2 to 0.3 in typical trusted environments, with 0.7 justified if emphasizing the potential danger of untrusted pickle data. Overall, the code appears benign, with security concerns centered on serialization method rather than malicious intent."
