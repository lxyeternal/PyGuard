  "purpose": "A distributed hyperparameter search class for scikit-learn, leveraging broadcasting and parallel execution in a Spark-like environment.",
  "sources": "X, y, groups (input data), parameter_iterable (hyperparameters), and internal broadcast variables.",
  "sinks": "Model training and scoring routines, data broadcast, and collection of results; no external network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data is broadcast to worker nodes; each test configuration is cloned and trained locally; results are collected and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments; use of random seed for CV is standard; no external data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard distributed hyperparameter search with data broadcast and parallel map functions. It uses cloning, cross-validation, and scoring routines consistent with scikit-learn practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data handling is within a distributed environment, which inherently carries some risk of data leakage if sensitive data is involved, but this is a typical aspect of distributed ML workflows and not malicious. The random seed initialization for CV is standard practice. The overall structure and logic are sound and align with legitimate distributed hyperparameter tuning patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of distributed hyperparameter search with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), justified by the distributed environment but with no active threats.",
