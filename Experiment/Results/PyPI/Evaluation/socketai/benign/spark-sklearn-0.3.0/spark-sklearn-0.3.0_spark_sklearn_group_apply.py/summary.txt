  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for applying pandas UDFs over grouped Spark data. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is reliance on internal Spark Java objects, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but this is not malicious per se. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
