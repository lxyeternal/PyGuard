{
  "purpose": "A subclass of SparkBaseSearchCV implementing distributed hyperparameter tuning for scikit-learn estimators using Spark.",
  "sources": "Input data X, optional y, and groups; external 'spark_sklearn' library for Spark integration.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or network calls; data flows within the class methods and scikit-learn functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through fit and _fit methods, utilizing ParameterGrid for parameter combinations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code extends standard scikit-learn GridSearchCV for Spark-based distributed execution, using typical patterns and libraries. No malicious behavior, external system calls, or obfuscation detected. The external 'spark_sklearn' library is noted but not suspicious. The malware score is justified as 0, and the low security risk scores reflect the benign nature of the implementation. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the straightforward structure and lack of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension for distributed hyperparameter search with Spark. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
