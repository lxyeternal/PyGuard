  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for model and data conversion in ML workflows. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1-0.2) justified by the use of dynamic class name strings which are hardcoded and not user-controlled."
