  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for setting up Spark-based unit tests, including Spark session management, data conversion, and assertions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (SEED), system info (sys.version_info), and imports modules (numpy, os, pandas, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; code primarily manages test setup and data processing.",
  "flows": "Environment variable SEED is read during test setup to seed randomness, which influences random number generation in tests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; use of environment variables to control randomness is common in testing contexts, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard for testing utilities in a Spark and machine learning environment. It manages Spark sessions, provides data conversion utilities, and controls randomness for reproducibility. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or malicious behavior are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution. Import statements and function definitions align with common testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility module designed for setting up Spark unit tests and ensuring reproducibility. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
