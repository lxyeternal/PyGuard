{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for creating and managing Spark sessions, setting up test cases, and data conversion for unit testing in PySpark environments.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (SEED), system info (sys.version_info), and potentially external packages (numpy, pandas, scipy, pyspark).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; data processed and converted within controlled functions. No direct data leakage or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and system info flow to seed initialization, data generation flows to test setup, Spark session management flows control resource handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages Spark sessions, provides test case utilities, and data conversion functions. It reads environment variables for setting random seeds, ensuring test reproducibility. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive data handling are evident. No suspicious code behavior or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard testing utilities for PySpark environments, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages resources and seed setting securely and predictably.",
