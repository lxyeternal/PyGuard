{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard license header and version declaration, likely part of a larger Python package or module.",
  "sources": "License comments, version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points identified",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static metadata",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a version variable assignment. There are no runtime behaviors, data inputs, or outputs. It appears to be boilerplate header code used in open-source projects, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. There are no code injection points, data leaks, or external communications. No obfuscation or hidden code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign header/license declaration typical for open-source packages. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
