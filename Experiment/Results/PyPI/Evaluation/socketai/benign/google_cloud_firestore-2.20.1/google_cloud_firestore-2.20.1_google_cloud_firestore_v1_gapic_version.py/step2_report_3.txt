  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code snippets are purely licensing comments and a version assignment (`__version__ = \"2.20.1\"`). There are no executable statements, data flows, input/output operations, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign, standard boilerplate code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports consistently state that there are no suspicious or malicious patterns, which aligns with the code. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature. Since the code is just static comments and a version string, assigning any higher score would be unreasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a high risk score. The code is purely metadata with no execution or data handling, so a risk score above 0.1 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard header with licensing comments and a version string, which is common in open-source packages. It contains no executable code, no data flows, no external inputs/outputs, and no suspicious constructs. Therefore, it poses no security risk or malicious threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
