{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata header for an open-source Python package, including licensing information and a version identifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows exist; the code is static metadata with no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version assignment, with no executable logic or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign header with no malicious or security concerns. The current analysis and scoring are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
