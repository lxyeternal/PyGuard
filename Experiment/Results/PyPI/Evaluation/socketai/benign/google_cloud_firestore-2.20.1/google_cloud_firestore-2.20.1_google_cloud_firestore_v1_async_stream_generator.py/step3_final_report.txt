{
  "purpose": "Defines an asynchronous generator class for iterating over Firestore stream results, with optional query profiling via explain options.",
  "sources": "The response_generator parameter providing streamed Firestore responses; optional explain_options attribute for profiling configuration.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal data processing and exception raising.",
  "flows": "The generator yields results from response_generator; get_explain_metrics may trigger additional async calls to retrieve metrics based on explain_options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured async generator wrapper for Firestore streaming results, handling explain metrics and exceptions appropriately. It relies on trusted external libraries and uses common async patterns. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behaviors are present. The exception handling and method implementations follow expected patterns, and the code's purpose is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK utility class for handling Firestore stream responses with optional profiling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by profiling features but without actual vulnerabilities.",
