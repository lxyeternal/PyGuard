{
  "purpose": "Provides an asynchronous generator class for handling streamed Firestore query results with optional profiling metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads from the provided response_generator generator and optionally accesses explain_options and explain_metrics properties.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or sensitive data output observed.",
  "flows": "Response generator yields data; get_explain_metrics method may invoke __anext__ to fetch query results and retrieve explain metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of type checking and type variables is standard; no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for async streaming of Firestore query results, handling explain metrics, with standard control flow and exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code relies on external Firestore APIs, which are trusted as part of the Google Cloud SDK. There are no hidden network operations, no suspicious data leaks, or unsafe practices observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a Firestore client library, implementing an async generator for query results and profiling metrics. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It operates as expected for its purpose without any suspicious or malicious code.",
