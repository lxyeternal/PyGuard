  "purpose": "Classes for representing and executing asynchronous Firestore queries, including streaming, partitioning, vector search, and aggregations.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as filters, limits, cursors, and API call responses like run_query and partition_query.",
  "sinks": "RPC calls to Firestore API endpoints (run_query, partition_query) and response parsing into DocumentSnapshot objects or metrics.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API requests; responses are processed into DocumentSnapshots, QueryPartitions, or metrics, which are yielded or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. Standard SDK patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK implementation for async Firestore querying, with proper async handling, response parsing, and API interactions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The data flow is straightforward, and the code relies on standard API calls. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured SDK code for async Firestore operations. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with standard API interaction. It is safe for deployment.",
