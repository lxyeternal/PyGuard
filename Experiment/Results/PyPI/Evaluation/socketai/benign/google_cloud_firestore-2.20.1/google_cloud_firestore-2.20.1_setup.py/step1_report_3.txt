  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package for the Google Cloud Firestore API client library, including package metadata, dependencies, and installation configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'google/cloud/firestore/gapic_version.py' and reads 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup()' to configure package installation, no direct data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file (source), then passes this data to the setup function (sink). No untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info from a file and reading the README file for description. Dependencies are specified with version constraints to ensure compatibility. The code adheres to common packaging practices without any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no signs of data leakage, network activity, or malicious payloads. The only file reads are from known files within the package directory. No obfuscated or malware-like code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard packaging procedures without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
