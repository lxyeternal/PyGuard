  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and standard for package setup, with the main concern being the use of 'exec()' to evaluate external code. If the version file is trusted and unaltered, the risk is minimal. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The pattern warrants caution but is common in many projects."
