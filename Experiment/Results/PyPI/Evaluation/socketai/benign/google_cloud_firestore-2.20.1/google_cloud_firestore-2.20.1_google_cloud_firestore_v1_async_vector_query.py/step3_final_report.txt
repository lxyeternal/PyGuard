{
  "purpose": "Represents an asynchronous Firestore vector query, providing methods to execute and stream query results with optional profiling.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration from class attributes, method parameters, and interacts with Firestore API via network calls.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to Firestore API; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Method calls (get, stream) initiate API requests; responses are processed into DocumentSnapshot or explain metrics; data flows from API responses to yield statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK implementation for async Firestore queries, using expected async patterns, API interactions, and data processing. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The network interactions are typical for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The code handles data streams and optional profiling correctly, with no signs of sabotage or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK component for async Firestore queries. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
