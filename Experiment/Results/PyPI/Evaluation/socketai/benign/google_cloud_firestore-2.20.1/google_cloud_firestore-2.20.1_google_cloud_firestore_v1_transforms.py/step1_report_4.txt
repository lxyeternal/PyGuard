{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and helper classes for Google Cloud Firestore operations, such as special sentinel values and array/ numeric transformations.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; it primarily initializes constants and helper classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could leak or affect untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up internal constants and helper objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines sentinel objects for Firestore special values, helper classes for array and numeric transformations, and associated constants. All classes are straightforward data structures with no input/output operations or external interactions. The code appears to serve as utility definitions for Firestore API interactions, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. There are no indications of data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of utility constants and classes for Firestore operations. It does not contain malware or security risks, and there are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors present.",
