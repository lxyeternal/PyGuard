{
  "purpose": "This code provides helper classes and constants for managing Firestore field transformations and special sentinel values.",
  "sources": "Constants and class definitions are set during module import and class instantiation. No input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems or files. No untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines classes and constants; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The class structures and constants are typical for Firestore interaction. No obfuscated or malicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines sentinel objects used to signal special Firestore field handling, such as deletion or server timestamp assignment. It also includes classes for handling list transformations and numeric field bounds and increments. The code is well-structured, with proper validation and no external data interactions or insecure practices. It appears to be a standard library module for Firestore utilities without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module for Firestore field transformations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe for use in a broader application context.",
