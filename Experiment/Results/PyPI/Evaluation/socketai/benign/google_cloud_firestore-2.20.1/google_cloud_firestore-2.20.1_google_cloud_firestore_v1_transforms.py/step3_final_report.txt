{
  "purpose": "Defines sentinel objects and helper classes for Firestore operations, such as delete markers, server timestamps, and array/numeric transformations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; constants and class constructors with input validation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of sentinel objects or transformation classes; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in '_NumericValue.value' docstring ('Lloat' instead of 'float') and 'slots' attribute in '_ValueList' should be '__slots__'. These are non-security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for Firestore, defining constants and classes for special field values and transformations. It contains no external input handling, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Input validation is minimal and standard. The minor typos do not impact security. The code's purpose is clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves as a utility library for Firestore. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk and zero malware scores are justified.",
