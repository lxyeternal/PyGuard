{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and helper classes for Google Cloud Firestore operations, including sentinel objects and field transformations.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and property methods, which read input parameters such as 'description', 'values', and 'value'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from class instantiation to internal attributes; no external data flows or untrusted data processing are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, no obfuscated code or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and focused on data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines sentinel objects to signal special handling in Firestore, and classes for list and numeric field transformations. It performs input validation for parameters but does not execute external commands, access network, or handle untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner. The purpose appears to be providing constants and helpers for Firestore operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of helper classes and constants for Firestore data transformations. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It is a benign utility module.",
