{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and helper classes for handling special values and transformations in Google Cloud Firestore operations.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; it mostly initializes constants and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; code primarily sets up internal constants and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard Firestore helper classes and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Sentinel objects for special Firestore values (delete, server timestamp), and several classes for list and numeric transformations used in Firestore documents. It includes basic validation and standard class methods. No external data reading, no network activity, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a Firestore client library with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard helper module for Firestore operations, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not process external input or perform any sensitive actions.",
