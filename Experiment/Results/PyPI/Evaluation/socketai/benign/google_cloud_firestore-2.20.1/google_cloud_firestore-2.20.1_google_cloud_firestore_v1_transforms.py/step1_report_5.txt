{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, sentinel objects, and helper classes for handling Firestore document transformations and special values.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; it mainly defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security issues; the code does not execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code creates objects and constants but does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward class and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility classes and constants for Firestore document transformations, including Sentinel objects and numeric transformers. It does not include any external data input, user interaction, or system commands. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities. The structure is simple and adheres to normal coding practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for internal use within a Firestore client library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of input/output handling, system commands, or external dependencies reduces the likelihood of malicious activity.",
