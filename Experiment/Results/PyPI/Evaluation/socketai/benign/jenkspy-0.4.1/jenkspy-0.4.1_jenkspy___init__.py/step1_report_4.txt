{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export functions and classes related to Jenks natural breaks, likely for data classification or segmentation.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only imports from a local module (.core).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and exports functions/classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The script sets version information, imports specific functions and classes from a relative module (.core), and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or network operations. The structure suggests standard package initialization or module setup, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup that imports and re-exports functions and classes related to Jenks natural breaks. It does not contain malware or security risks and appears to serve as part of a larger, legitimate package.",
