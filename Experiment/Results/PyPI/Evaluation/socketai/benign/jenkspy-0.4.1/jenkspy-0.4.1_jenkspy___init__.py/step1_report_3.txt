{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports functions and classes related to Jenks natural breaks algorithm.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local .core module, which may contain implementation details.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no functions or code that handle external input or produce output directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer. It sets a version string, imports specific functions and classes from a local core module, and declares exports. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The presence of an internal import from the same package suggests the actual implementation resides in the 'core' module, which was not provided. Without examining 'core', no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a module interface definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard package component exposing relevant functions and classes.",
