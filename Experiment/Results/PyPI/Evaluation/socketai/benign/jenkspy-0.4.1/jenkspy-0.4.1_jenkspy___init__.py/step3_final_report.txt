  "purpose": "Module initialization file that imports and exposes core functions/classes for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local '.core' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import statements to module exports (__all__)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward package initializer that imports specific functions and classes from an internal module and exposes them via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The high risk scores in some reports are unjustified, as the code itself is simple and standard. The actual implementation resides in the 'core' module, which is not provided, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
