  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward module that imports functions/classes from an internal `.core` module and exposes them via `__all__`. No suspicious behavior, no dynamic code, no external data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, a minimal module setup likely in an `__init__.py`. No external data, no dynamic code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are zero; risk is zero.\n- **Risk justification:** No security concerns based on this snippet.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—imports from internal module, no external data, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Zero malware, zero obfuscated, zero risk.\n- **Note:** The analysis correctly notes that without inspecting `core`, no malicious activity can be inferred.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous reports—standard package setup, no external data, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others—module setup, imports, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Zero malware, zero obfuscated, zero risk.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity or obfuscation:** None. All reports agree on this.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** Consistent, accurate, and based on the code snippet provided.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — benign module setup, no external or dynamic code, no data handling.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the actual implementation resides in the `.core` module, which is not provided, there is no way to definitively rule out malicious code within that. However, based solely on this snippet and the reports, there's no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, benign package module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence at hand.",
