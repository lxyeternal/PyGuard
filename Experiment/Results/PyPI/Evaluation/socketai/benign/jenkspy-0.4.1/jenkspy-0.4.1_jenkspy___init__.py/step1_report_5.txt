{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports specific functions and classes from a local core module, then exports them for public use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'core' module within the package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external system calls, or sensitive data exposures are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; straightforward module setup",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module versioning, imports specific components from a local module, and defines the public API. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or perform any network or system operations. All imports are from local files, and there are no security-sensitive operations or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply re-exports functions and classes from a core module, serving as a clean, safe entry point.",
