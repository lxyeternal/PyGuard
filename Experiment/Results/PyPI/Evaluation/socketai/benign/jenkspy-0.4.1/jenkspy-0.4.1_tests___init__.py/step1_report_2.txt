  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or function within a larger application, but the exact intent is unclear due to lack of context and minimal code provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables, user inputs, or external files. Specific source points are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands that could process untrusted data. These are not explicitly visible or connected to untrusted sources in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are evident based on the provided code snippet, suggesting either simple or incomplete code structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified. The code appears straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "A careful review of the code shows standard Python constructs without indicators of malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are observed. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate. The code does not perform any actions that could be linked to malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, there are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or significant security risks within this code snippet. The overall security risk is low. However, due to limited context and code scope, confidence in this conclusion is moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
