  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or library for handling data processing or networking tasks, but without explicit comments or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, or execution of dynamically generated code. Specific sinks are not explicitly identified due to lack of code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input parameters to functions that process or transmit data, potentially reaching network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated sections are detected. Lack of comments or documentation is noted but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The provided code was empty or not included in the input. Without concrete code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Given the absence of code, no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior can be identified. The review is limited to noting that no code was supplied for analysis.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. The absence of code prevents any detailed assessment.",
