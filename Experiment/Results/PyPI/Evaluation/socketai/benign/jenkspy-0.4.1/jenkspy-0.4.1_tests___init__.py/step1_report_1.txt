  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions within a larger application, without any clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, environment variables, or possibly external files or network sources if present, but specific input sources are not explicitly evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to standard output, files, or external systems; no explicit sinks or data leaks are evident from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (variables, environment variables) to processing functions and then to output or storage; no suspicious or abnormal flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. No obfuscation, malicious constructs, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard Python functions and logic with typical data processing patterns. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of third-party libraries seems typical, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated sections are present. The code's flow is straightforward and consistent with normal operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activity or security flaws identified.",
