  "purpose": "The code appears benign, performing standard data processing with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data sources identified; analysis based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or points where data could leak or cause harm identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The provided code or descriptions show no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign nature. The reasoning is consistent across reports, and the lack of code or suspicious patterns supports these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
