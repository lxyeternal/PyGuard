{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the 'jenks_breaks' function, the internal matrices, and the 'JenksNaturalBreaks' class, validating their correctness, error handling, and behavior.",
  "sources": "Data inputs for testing (test_data, other datasets), and function/method calls like jenks_breaks() and class methods such as fit(), predict(), group().",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is sent over networks, written to files, or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Test data is used as input for functions and class methods; no untrusted data flow to external systems or outputs beyond test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Tests strictly validate functionality, error handling, and correctness.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of unittests for a Python module implementing Jenks natural breaks. It tests correct outputs, error handling, input validation, and internal matrix calculations. All functions and classes tested are typical and contain no malicious or suspicious logic. No external data transmission, code injection, or privacy violations are detected. The data used is solely for validation purposes. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for the Jenks natural breaks implementation. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It solely performs correctness validation and error handling checks. Overall, the code is safe with very low risk.",
