  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Cython extension module named 'jenkspy.jenks'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, Cython, and source file 'jenkspy/src/jenks.pyx'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration compiles the 'jenks.pyx' Cython source into a Python extension module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard build procedures with Cython.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary build tools, defines a Cython extension, and sets up the build process. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script for compiling a Cython module. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent; it simply automates extension compilation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Cython extension with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended to facilitate package compilation and distribution.",
