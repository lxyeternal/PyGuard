  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Cython extension module named 'jenkspy.jenks'.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, Cython, and related modules; defines extension modules and setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present; standard build configuration.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Extension definition -> setup function call (cythonize extension and build command).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup for compiling Cython modules. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for building a Cython extension. Defines an extension targeting 'jenkspy.jenks' from a source file 'jenkspy/src/jenks.pyx'. The setup function calls cythonize on the extension list and specifies build commands. No input or data sources, no data sinks, and no dynamic or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for building Cython extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for compiling a Cython extension module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It appears to be legitimate build configuration code.",
