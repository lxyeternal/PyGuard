  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a statistical classification algorithm. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern mainly due to broad exception handling, which does not constitute malicious activity."
