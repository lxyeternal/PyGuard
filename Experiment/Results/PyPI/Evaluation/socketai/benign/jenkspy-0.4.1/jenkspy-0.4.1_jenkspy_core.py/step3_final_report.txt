  "purpose": "The code implements Fisher-Jenks natural breaks classification for numerical data, providing methods for fitting, predicting, grouping, and evaluating the goodness of fit.",
  "sources": "Input sequences provided to 'fit', 'predict', 'group', and 'goodness_of_variance_fit' methods; data validation functions also read input data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or file operations are present; data remains within the functions and class attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation functions into the classification algorithms, with internal calculations and outputs; no external or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The broad exception handling in 'get_label_' could mask runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of Fisher-Jenks natural breaks classification. It performs input validation, uses an external 'jenks' module for core calculations, and provides methods for classification and evaluation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external system interaction are present. The broad exception handling in 'get_label_' is a minor concern but not security-related. The overall structure and logic are typical for such algorithms, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a statistical classification algorithm. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern mainly due to broad exception handling, which does not constitute malicious activity.",
