  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is only import statements with no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly identifies that the code is just imports and forward reference updates, with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, the code is static imports with no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is purely import statements for a schema library.  \n- **Malware potential:** None detected. The code does not execute any malicious actions or contain suspicious patterns.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None present.  \n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero, as the code is static and does not handle untrusted data or perform network/file operations.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is benign and purely structural.  \n\n### Additional notes:\n- The consistent, correct assessment across all reports confirms the benign nature of this code snippet.  \n- No adjustments needed; the scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard module import setup for an OpenAPI schema library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern signals. The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
