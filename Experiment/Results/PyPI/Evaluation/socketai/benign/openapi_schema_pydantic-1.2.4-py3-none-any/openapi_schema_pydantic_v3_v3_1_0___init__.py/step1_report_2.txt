{
  "purpose": "This code defines import statements for various modules related to the OpenAPI v3.1.0 schema, establishing the structure for an OpenAPI implementation or documentation tool.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from the same package (relative imports), primarily from local files such as .open_api, .info, .contact, etc.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and updates forward references for certain classes, with no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains straightforward import statements and method calls without any suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of import statements establishing dependencies among modules defining parts of an OpenAPI schema. It includes updates to forward references, which are common in Python class models with circular dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code does not process input or perform any operations that could be exploited or abused. It appears to be a legitimate module setup for an API schema definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, well-structured set of import statements for an OpenAPI schema package. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
