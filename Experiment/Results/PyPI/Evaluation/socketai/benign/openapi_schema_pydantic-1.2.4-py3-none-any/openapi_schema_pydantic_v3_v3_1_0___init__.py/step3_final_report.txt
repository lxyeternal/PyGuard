  "purpose": "Static import statements for OpenAPI schema components and forward reference resolution, serving as a module setup for schema definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various schema modules; calls to update_forward_refs() for classes Encoding and Schema.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static code with no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and forward reference updates; no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward static imports and reference updates.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for schema classes related to OpenAPI 3.1.0, with calls to resolve forward references. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network calls, or data processing. The code is standard for schema module setup, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The consistent pattern across multiple reports confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module setup for OpenAPI schema components. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk signals are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
