{
  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model for a Tag object with optional external documentation and example schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, type annotations, and imports ExternalDocumentation from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output mechanisms are present; data validation is performed via Pydantic.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., user-provided JSON) would flow into the model validation, but no external data flow or unsafe operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data model using Pydantic, with standard type annotations and optional fields. It imports an external class for documentation purposes. The configuration ignores extra fields and provides an example schema. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure and logic are straightforward and typical for data validation schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pydantic model for API tagging metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
