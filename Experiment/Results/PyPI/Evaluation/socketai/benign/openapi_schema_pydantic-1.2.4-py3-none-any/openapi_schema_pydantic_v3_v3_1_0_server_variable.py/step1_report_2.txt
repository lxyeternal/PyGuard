  "purpose": "Define a data model for server variables used in URL template substitution, with validation and optional fields.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or external data sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists, as there are no data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The use of type hints, Pydantic for data validation, and descriptive comments is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model 'ServerVariable' with optional and required fields, including validation constraints like non-empty 'enum' (not explicitly enforced here but mentioned in comments) and a required 'default' string. The Config class ignores extra fields. The code appears to be a typical data model for API configuration purposes with no malicious patterns, no external data handling, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of a data model for server variables, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to structure data with validation constraints and does not interact with external data sources or sinks.",
