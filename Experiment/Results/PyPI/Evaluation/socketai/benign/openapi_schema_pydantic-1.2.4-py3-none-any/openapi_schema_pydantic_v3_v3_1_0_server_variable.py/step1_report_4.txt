{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for server variables used in URL template substitution, with validation and optional fields.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read in this code. The code defines a class structure for data validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data flows to external systems, no data leaks, or external output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines a data model without input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. Use of pydantic for data validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class with optional and required fields, and includes documentation and a configuration class to ignore extra fields. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward data model for server variables, with validation rules and optional descriptions. No external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious data model definition using pydantic, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
