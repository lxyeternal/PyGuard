  "purpose": "Define a server variable schema for URL template substitution in API specifications.",
  "sources": "No external input; static class attributes and comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a data model without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard Pydantic model with clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic data model representing server variables with optional enum and description fields, and a required default value. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of 'extra=Extra.ignore' is standard. Comments mention validation expectations but are not enforced. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. All indicators point to benign, schema-defining code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard schema definition with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign appropriate scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and are consistent with the code's behavior.",
