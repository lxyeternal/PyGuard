{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for server variables used in URL template substitution in API specifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from class instantiation parameters, specifically 'enum', 'default', and 'description' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include validation or serialization functions that process the 'enum' and 'default' values; no explicit data sinks are present that lead to external systems or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiation (sources) into internal attributes, with validation or processing potentially occurring in the Pydantic BaseModel framework before usage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with optional fields and validation rules. It uses standard practices for data modeling and includes documentation comments. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of 'extra = Extra.ignore' to ignore unspecified fields, which is standard in Pydantic models. No external network calls, file operations, or insecure code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured data model for server variables. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and designed for legitimate API specification purposes.",
