{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias for a dictionary mapping string paths to PathItem objects, representing API endpoint paths and their operations.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; static type alias and descriptive comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted data; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only type alias and extensive documentation comments; no executable logic, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a type alias 'Paths' and descriptive docstrings explaining the structure and usage of path objects in an API. It has no executable code, no input handling, no data processing, and no interactions with external systems or sensitive data. The comments describe expected behaviors and constraints for URL paths, but do not introduce any code that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type alias declaration with detailed documentation, containing no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely declarative and does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
