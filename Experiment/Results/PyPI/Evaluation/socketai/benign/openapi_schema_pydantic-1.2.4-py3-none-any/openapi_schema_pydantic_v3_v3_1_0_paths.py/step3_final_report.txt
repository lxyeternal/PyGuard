  "purpose": "Defines a type alias 'Paths' as a dictionary mapping string paths to PathItem objects, used for API endpoint path definitions.",
  "sources": "Static type alias declaration; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static declaration with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static type alias with extensive descriptive comments about URL construction, path templating, and API conventions. It imports necessary types but contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The comments serve documentation purposes only. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's static nature and clarity indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and well-documented, posing no security or supply chain threat. All signals and reports correctly identify it as safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.",
