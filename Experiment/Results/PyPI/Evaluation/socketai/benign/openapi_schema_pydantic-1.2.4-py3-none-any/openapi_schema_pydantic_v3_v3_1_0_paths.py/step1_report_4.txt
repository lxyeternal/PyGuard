{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a dictionary mapping string paths to PathItem objects, with descriptive comments about path structure and URL construction in an API specification context.",
  "sources": "Code reads its own module import statements, type annotations, and comments; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a simple type alias definition with documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior; comments are purely descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type alias 'Paths' for a dictionary with string keys and PathItem values, including extensive comments explaining the purpose and URL handling for API paths. It imports 'Dict' for type annotation and references a local import 'PathItem'. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. All content is static and purely descriptive, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented type alias declaration used for API path definitions. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It is safe for use and provides no indication of supply chain attack or sabotage.",
