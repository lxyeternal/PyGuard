{
  "purpose": "The code defines a type alias for security requirement objects used in OpenAPI specifications and provides detailed documentation on their structure and usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads from its own definitions and docstrings. There are no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not perform data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily consists of type alias definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive docstrings describing security schemes and requirements but contains no executable logic or data processing. No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining a type alias and accompanying documentation related to security schemes in OpenAPI. It does not execute any logic, process external data, or perform operations that could be malicious. The docstrings provide context but do not introduce risks. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or code execution patterns are present. Overall, the code appears to be standard API documentation and type annotations with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely structural and informational, serving as documentation and type definitions for API security schemes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and does not pose any security threats.",
