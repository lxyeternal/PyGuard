  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely static: type alias `SecurityRequirement` as `Dict[str, List[str]]` and extensive descriptive comments.\n   - No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as documentation and type annotations with no malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign and purely descriptive.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - They correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as zero, given the static, documentation-only nature.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's static, documentation-only nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues are present that warrant a higher security risk score.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform any operations, or include any potentially malicious patterns.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Since there is no malicious behavior, the malware score should be 0.\n   - The code contains no code execution, external calls, or data manipulation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they interpret the code as static documentation.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, well-documented, and poses no security threat.**",
