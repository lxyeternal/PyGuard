  "purpose": "The code defines a type alias for security requirements and documents related concepts for OpenAPI security schemes.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; it is purely documentation and type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential security vulnerabilities are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code does not handle data processing or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely documentation and type alias without any executable logic. There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias declarations and multi-line comments explaining the purpose and structure of security requirements in an OpenAPI context. It does not include executable code, data processing, or external interactions. All elements are standard and typical for API documentation or type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe and contains no malicious intent or security issues. It is purely descriptive and used for documentation or type hinting in a Python project related to OpenAPI specifications.",
