  "purpose": "Define types and documentation for security requirement objects in an OpenAPI specification.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; the code contains only comments and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no output or data processing functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely contains type definitions and descriptive comments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only comments and type annotations without executable logic; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a type alias 'SecurityRequirement' as a dictionary mapping strings to list of strings, along with extensive comments explaining its purpose within an OpenAPI context. It does not include any executable code, input handling, or data processing logic. The comments describe the intended use of security schemes and their composition rules, but do not perform any operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as documentation and type annotation for OpenAPI security schemes. It does not contain any executable code, input/output handling, or potentially malicious logic. There are no security concerns or malware indications within this snippet.",
