{
  "purpose": "The code defines a type alias for a security requirement data structure used in OpenAPI specifications, along with descriptive comments explaining its usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings, type annotations, and comments within the source file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data, execute commands, or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The code does not include data flow logic; it is purely type definitions and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code contains only type hints and documentation comments without dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a type alias definition for 'SecurityRequirement' as a dictionary mapping strings to lists of strings, and extensive comments describing the purpose and usage of security schemes in OpenAPI specifications. It does not perform any data handling, user input, or execution logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The comments are purely explanatory, and the type alias is static. No external resources or potentially malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, static definition of data structures with detailed documentation for API security configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation.",
