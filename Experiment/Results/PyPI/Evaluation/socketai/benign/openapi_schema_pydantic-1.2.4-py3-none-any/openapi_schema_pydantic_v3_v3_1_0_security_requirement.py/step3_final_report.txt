  "purpose": "Type alias definition for SecurityRequirement in OpenAPI specifications, with detailed documentation on security schemes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded type alias and descriptive comments; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; code is purely declarative and documentation-oriented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type alias with extensive comments explaining security schemes in OpenAPI. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external resource access. The comments serve as documentation, and the code itself is simple and clear. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and descriptive nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely static documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and analysis are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
