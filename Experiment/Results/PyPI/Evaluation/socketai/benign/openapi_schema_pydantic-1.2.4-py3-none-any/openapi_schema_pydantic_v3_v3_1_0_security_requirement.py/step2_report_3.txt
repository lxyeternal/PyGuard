  "review": "Let's proceed with a detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is purely static, with type alias and descriptive comments.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None. The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign and documentation-oriented.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's scoring aligns with the content.\n- **Risk Justification:** No risk indicated; scores are appropriate.\n- **Additional Comments:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is straightforward documentation and type annotations.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None. The reasoning correctly states that there are no executable or malicious components.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These are appropriate.\n- **Risk Justification:** No justification needed; the code is purely descriptive.\n- **Additional Comments:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code remains static with no data handling.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None. The report correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Risk Justification:** No risk, as the code is documentation and type annotations.\n- **Additional Comments:** Correct evaluation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is only type alias and comments.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Correct.\n- **Risk Justification:** No risk; the code is purely informational.\n- **Additional Comments:** Well justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is standard documentation and type aliasing.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None. The review is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Risk Justification:** No risk, as the code does not perform any operations.\n- **Additional Comments:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is static, documentation-oriented, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in static documentation/type annotations)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. No modifications or escalations are necessary based on the provided code snippets.",
