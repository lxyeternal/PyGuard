  "purpose": "The code sets up logging configuration by adding a NullHandler to the logger for the current module.",
  "sources": "The logger configuration code that initializes logging for the module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named '.v3', which suggests a relative import within a package. It then configures the logger by adding a NullHandler, preventing logging errors if no other handlers are set. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code is typical for setting up logging in a Python package. No input data handling or external communication occurs here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for logging setup in Python packages. It does not contain malware or security risks based on this snippet.",
