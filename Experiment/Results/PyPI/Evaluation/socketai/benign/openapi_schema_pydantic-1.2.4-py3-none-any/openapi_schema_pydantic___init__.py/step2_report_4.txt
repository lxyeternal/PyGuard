  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code sets up logging with a NullHandler.\n- Finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Confidence: 1 (high certainty)\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is accurate. The code is straightforward and standard for logging setup. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms standard logging setup.\n- No untrusted data or external communication.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is benign. The report is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Notes the import of `.v3`, which could be suspicious but cannot be judged solely on this snippet.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to the import.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe cautious approach is justified. Importing `.v3` could potentially introduce malicious code if the module is compromised, but there's no evidence here. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights the use of `import *` from `.v3`, which can obscure what is imported.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nUse of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious. The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable given the potential for hidden imports, but no evidence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, confirms standard setup.\n- No suspicious activity or data handling.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n- The code snippets are all minimal, standard logging setup.\n- The only potential concern is the import of `.v3`, which could contain malicious code, but there's no evidence here.\n- The malware score remains 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.1 in some reports, reflecting the potential risk of the imported module, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The overall **malware score** should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**, since there's no obfuscation.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased if the `.v3` module's origin or integrity is uncertain, but based solely on this snippet, 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the import of an external/local module that could potentially be malicious if compromised)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the reports are consistent. The only caveat is the import of `.v3`, which warrants further inspection in a real-world scenario, but from this snippet alone, no malicious activity is present.",
