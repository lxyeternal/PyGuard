  "purpose": "Setup logging configuration for a Python module, importing all contents from a submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads the logging configuration and the contents of the .v3 module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted data or user input; no sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a local module (.v3) can obscure what code is imported, which could hide malicious or unintended code. However, on its own, this is not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger and adds a NullHandler to suppress logging output. It then imports all contents from a sibling module named v3. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious actions present. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard logging setup with a benign import statement. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
