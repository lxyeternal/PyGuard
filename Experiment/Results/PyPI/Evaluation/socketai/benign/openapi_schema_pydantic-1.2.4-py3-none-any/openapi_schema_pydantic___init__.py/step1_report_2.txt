{
  "purpose": "Configure logging with a NullHandler to prevent logging errors if no other handlers are set.",
  "sources": "Importing from the local v3 module",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is primarily setup/configuration",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code imports a module and sets up logging; no suspicious patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and adds a NullHandler to the logger, which is standard practice to avoid 'No handlers could be found for logger' warnings. It does not process user input, environment variables, or external data. The import statement from .v3 suggests dependency on a local or package module but does not inherently imply malicious intent. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical logging setup and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
