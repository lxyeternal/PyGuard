  "purpose": "Importing all components from the local v3 module and setting up logging with a NullHandler to avoid 'No handler' warnings.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the local v3 module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and configures logging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module 'v3' and sets up logging to prevent logging warnings. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code. The use of 'import *' can be considered poor practice but is not inherently malicious. The logging setup with NullHandler is common in libraries to suppress logging unless configured by the user.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not read or process untrusted input, nor does it perform any suspicious actions.",
