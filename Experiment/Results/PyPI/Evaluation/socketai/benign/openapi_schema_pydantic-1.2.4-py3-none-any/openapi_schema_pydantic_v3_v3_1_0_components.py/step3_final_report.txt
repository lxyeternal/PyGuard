  "purpose": "Defines a Pydantic model 'Components' for OpenAPI reusable components, including schemas, responses, parameters, etc., with example documentation.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes and the 'schema_extra' example data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely declarative data schema without data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static, well-structured schema with no suspicious patterns or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static data schema for OpenAPI components using Pydantic. It imports standard modules and local models, with no runtime data handling, dynamic code, or obfuscation. The embedded example is static documentation data. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, declarative nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema definition for API components with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
