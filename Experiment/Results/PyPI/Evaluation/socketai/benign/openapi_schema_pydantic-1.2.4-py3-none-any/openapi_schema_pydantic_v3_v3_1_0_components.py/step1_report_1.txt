  "purpose": "Definition of the Components class for OpenAPI Specification, holding reusable objects.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code primarily defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a schema model without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a Pydantic model 'Components' with optional dictionaries for various reusable OpenAPI objects, and includes a schema example in the Config class. It appears to be a straightforward, standard schema definition with no input handling, external data processing, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data schema for OpenAPI components. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a benign definition of API component data structures.",
