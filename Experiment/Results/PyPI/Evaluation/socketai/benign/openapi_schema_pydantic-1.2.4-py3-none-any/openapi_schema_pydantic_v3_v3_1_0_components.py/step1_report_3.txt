  "purpose": "Define a data model for reusable components in an OpenAPI Specification using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and internal modules; class and attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Code primarily consists of data model definitions without any dynamic code execution, input processing, or data output functions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious references detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel subclass for API components, with various optional dictionaries referencing other schema objects, parameters, responses, etc. It uses standard Python and Pydantic features, with no dynamic execution or data manipulation. The example schema in schema_extra is static and does not perform any computations or external calls. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The imports are from well-known libraries, and the internal modules are presumably part of the same package. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data schema definition for API components, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves as a data structure container without executing or transmitting sensitive data.",
