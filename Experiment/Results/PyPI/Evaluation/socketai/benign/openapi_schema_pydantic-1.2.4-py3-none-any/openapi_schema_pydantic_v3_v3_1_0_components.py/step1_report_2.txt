  "purpose": "Define a data model for reusable components in an OpenAPI Specification using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and local modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is primarily declarative data structure definitions with no data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The class contains example data for schema documentation, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model for OpenAPI components with optional dictionaries for various reusable objects. It imports necessary modules and local models, and sets class configurations. The embedded 'schema_extra' provides example data for documentation purposes. There are no functions, external data reads, or dynamic behaviors that could be exploited. The code appears standard and designed for API specification modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data model definition for OpenAPI components, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, declarative structure used for API schema representation.",
