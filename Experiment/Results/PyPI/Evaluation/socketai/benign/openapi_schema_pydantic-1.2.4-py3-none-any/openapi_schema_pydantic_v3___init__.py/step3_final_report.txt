  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the import statement 'from .v3_1_0 import *' in the context of supply chain security, malicious behavior, and code risks.",
  "sources": "The relative import from the local module '.v3_1_0', which may contain untrusted or malicious code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially all symbols imported from '.v3_1_0', which could include malicious functions or data if the module is compromised.",
  "flows": "Untrusted module '.v3_1_0' is imported via wildcard, potentially executing malicious code or hiding malicious functions within the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import obscures imported symbols; reliance on versioned module '.v3_1_0' without verification; no evidence of malicious code in the snippet itself.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import with a wildcard, which is a risky practice due to namespace pollution and obscurity. No malicious activity is directly visible; the main concern is the trustworthiness of the '.v3_1_0' module. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code. The security risk score is moderate (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting the potential danger if the module is compromised. Confidence in this assessment is high given the limited context. The use of wildcard import and versioned module name warrants caution, but without further information, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but poses supply chain risks if the module is untrusted or compromised. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The current scores are appropriate; verification of the module's source and integrity is recommended to mitigate potential risks.",
