  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module v3_1_0",
  "sources": "The import statement loads code from a local module named v3_1_0",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling points are visible in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not determinable from this single import statement alone; depends on what is imported and how it's used later",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent anomalies; however, importing entire modules can sometimes hide malicious code if the module itself is compromised",
  "analysis": "This code solely performs an import from a local module v3_1_0. The import syntax 'from .v3_1_0 import *' indicates importing all symbols from the module in the same package. No malicious code or behavior can be inferred from this line alone; it depends on the contents of v3_1_0. Without further code or context, there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks visible here. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or other operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior. The security risk depends entirely on the contents of the v3_1_0 module, which is not provided. As it stands, the code is benign but warrants review of the imported module for security issues.",
