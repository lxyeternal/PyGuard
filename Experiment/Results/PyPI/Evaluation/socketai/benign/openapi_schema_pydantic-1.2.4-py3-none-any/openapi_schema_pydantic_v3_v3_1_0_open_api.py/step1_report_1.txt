{
  "purpose": "Defines the data model for the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard typing, pydantic, and local modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no output or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this is a static data model definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an OpenAPI schema using Pydantic models. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with attributes, and provides docstrings for documentation. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or external interactions that could be malicious. The class serves as a schema container, with optional and default values set appropriately. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model definition for OpenAPI specifications, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It adheres to best practices for schema modeling without including any malicious or obfuscated code.",
