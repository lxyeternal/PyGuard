{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification using Pydantic for validation and serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and local modules; class attributes and default values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present; no input/output operations or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Data definitions and default values within class attributes; no runtime data flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. The code uses standard Pydantic features to define a schema.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines an OpenAPI data model with various optional and required fields, providing metadata, server info, paths, components, security, tags, and external documentation. It uses standard default values and type annotations. No code executes external commands, accesses environment variables, or performs network operations. The presence of documentation strings and use of type hints indicate clear intent for schema validation rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic model for representing the OpenAPI specification, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to serve as a schema definition without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
