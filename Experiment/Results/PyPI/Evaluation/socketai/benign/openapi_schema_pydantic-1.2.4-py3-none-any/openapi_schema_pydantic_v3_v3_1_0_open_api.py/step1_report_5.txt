{
  "purpose": "Define the data model for an OpenAPI specification document using Pydantic classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and local modules; class attributes; default values; optional fields.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no code execution, network access, or data leakage mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only defines data structures without handling untrusted input or performing operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures observed. The code adheres to standard Pydantic model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a Pydantic model for the OpenAPI document with clearly defined fields, default values, and documentation. It imports necessary modules and sets configuration to ignore extra fields. No external data handling, no network or system commands, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The model's purpose is solely to structure API metadata, with all fields being standard for OpenAPI specifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a data model for OpenAPI using Pydantic. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no evidence of sabotage. It is safe and intended for use as a schema definition.",
