  "purpose": "Define the data model for the OpenAPI document using Pydantic models with type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and local modules; class attributes with default values and optional fields.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data handling, network operations, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is a straightforward data model definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic data model for the OpenAPI specification, importing necessary modules and setting class attributes with defaults and optional values. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from external sources is present. The structure is standard for such models, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign implementation of an OpenAPI schema using Pydantic. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
