  "purpose": "This code defines a Pydantic model representing the OpenAPI 3.1.0 schema, serving as a static data validation and documentation structure.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard typing modules, Pydantic, and internal components; class attribute definitions with default values and documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external network interactions, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "The code is purely declarative; data flows are limited to static attribute assignments within the class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static schema model using Pydantic for data validation. It contains no dynamic or external operations, network calls, or obfuscated code. All reports concur on its benign nature, assigning malware and security risk scores of zero. The code's purpose is solely to model the OpenAPI specification, with proper use of optional fields and defaults. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present, and the code structure aligns with standard practices for schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured OpenAPI schema model with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are consistent with its static, schema-only nature.",
