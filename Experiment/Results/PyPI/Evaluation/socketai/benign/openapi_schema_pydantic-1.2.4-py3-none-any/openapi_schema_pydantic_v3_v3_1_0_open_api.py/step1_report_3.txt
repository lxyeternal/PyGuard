  "purpose": "Defines the data model for an OpenAPI document using Pydantic, specifying fields, defaults, and optional components.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (typing, pydantic, internal components), class attributes, default values, and class configuration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or output; no data leakage or external communication points present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and defaults; no external data input flows to vulnerable points identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code models an OpenAPI document structure with Pydantic, utilizing type annotations, default values, and optional fields. It imports necessary components and sets default values for some fields. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external data handling are present. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured data model for OpenAPI documents. It does not contain malware or security risks. It is safe and intended for schema validation or API description purposes.",
