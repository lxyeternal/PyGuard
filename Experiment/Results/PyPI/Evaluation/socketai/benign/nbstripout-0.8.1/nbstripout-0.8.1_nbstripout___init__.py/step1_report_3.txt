{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions and variables from internal modules for package setup or utility purposes, and defines the module's public API and documentation string.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._nbstripout and ._utils modules, accessing internal functions and variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are apparent; no data is being sent over networks, written to files, or used in insecure commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into the current module's namespace; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of internal modules is typical for package code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from internal modules, assigns the imported items to the module's __all__ list for public API exposure, and sets the module documentation string. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or insecure practices are observed. The internal module imports suggest this is part of a package's internal setup or utility functions, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package module initialization code with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present. It is safe and typical for a Python package's internal module structure.",
