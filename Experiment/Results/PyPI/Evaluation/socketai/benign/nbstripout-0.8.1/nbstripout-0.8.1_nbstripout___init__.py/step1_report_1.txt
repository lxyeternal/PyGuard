{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions and variables from internal modules for use in the package, and defines module exports and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_nbstripout and _utils).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions and variables from internal modules and sets the module's __all__ and __doc__ attributes. There is no input/output handling, data processing, or system interaction. The imports are from internal modules, likely part of the package's implementation, not external or network sources. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident based on this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import and export declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
