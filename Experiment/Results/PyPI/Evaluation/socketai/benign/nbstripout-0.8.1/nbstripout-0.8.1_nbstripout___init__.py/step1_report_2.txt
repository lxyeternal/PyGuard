{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports functions and variables from internal submodules, exposing them via __all__ for external use. It likely serves as part of a larger package related to utility functions, possibly for managing or stripping output from notebooks.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._nbstripout and ._utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code only imports and re-exports functions/variables",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; the code simply assigns imported functions to module namespace",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code only performs straightforward imports and attribute assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It also assigns the imported docstring to __doc__. There are no input sources, no processing of untrusted data, no network activity, or file operations. The structure is minimal and standard for Python package modules. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and export mechanism without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any network, I/O, or data handling that could pose a security risk. The code is safe and standard in structure.",
