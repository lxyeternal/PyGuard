  "purpose": "Module initialization and API exposure for internal functions and variables.",
  "sources": "Internal modules: ._nbstripout and ._utils, from which functions and variables are imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external data handling, no network operations, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "Import statements from internal modules to module namespace; assignment of __doc__ from imported docstring.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and sets module attributes. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is typical for a package's interface module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
