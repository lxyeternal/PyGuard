{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import and export module, exposing functions and variables from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: ._nbstripout and ._utils",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is a straightforward import/export module with no data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed; no dynamic execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from internal modules, then defines an __all__ list for exports and assigns __doc__ to a docstring. The structure is standard for a Python package module to control namespace exposure. No suspicious code or behaviors, such as network activity, data handling, or security-sensitive operations, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module for exposing internal functions and variables. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident based on this fragment.",
