{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import interface for a Python package, exposing specific functions and variables for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and variables from internal modules '_nbstripout' and '_utils'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code does not process or handle untrusted input or perform external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A: The code simply imports and re-exports functions and variables without any data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and adheres to typical package structure; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and variables from internal modules, then defines an export list and assigns a docstring. It acts as a module initializer or interface. No input reading, data processing, or external communications are present. The structure appears standard for Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module interface file for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply exposes functions and variables for use elsewhere.",
