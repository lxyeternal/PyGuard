{
  "purpose": "This code contains test functions for the 'pop_recursive' utility, which manipulates nested dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input data from test parameters and fixtures; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows are within the test assertions, comparing expected and actual results, all controlled within the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and utility functions, defines test data and fixtures, and runs parameterized tests on 'pop_recursive'. There are no indications of external data handling, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. The test functions are straightforward and used for verifying dictionary manipulations. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a utility function, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for testing.",
