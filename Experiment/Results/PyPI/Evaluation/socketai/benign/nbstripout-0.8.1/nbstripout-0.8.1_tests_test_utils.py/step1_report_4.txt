{
  "purpose": "The code contains test cases for the 'pop_recursive' utility function, which manipulates nested dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pytest' for testing and a utility function 'pop_recursive' from an internal module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or external data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code primarily defines and runs test cases on internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code is straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of unit tests designed to verify the behavior of a dictionary manipulation function. It creates sample dictionaries and uses parameterized tests to validate that 'pop_recursive' correctly retrieves and modifies nested dictionary data. There are no signs of data leakage, external communication, or malicious modifications. The code's structure is typical for testing, and no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for testing a utility function with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity detected. It functions as intended for code validation purposes.",
