{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the 'pop_recursive' utility function, which manipulates nested dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from function calls ('make_dict', 'make_data') and within the test functions, using fixtures and parameterized inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'make_data' into test functions and is used as input to 'pop_recursive'. The function's output is compared against expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses standard testing practices with no obfuscated code or hidden mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a utility function that modifies nested dictionaries. It uses pytest fixtures and parameterization for thorough testing. No external data input, no network operations, no credential handling, or other security-sensitive actions are present. The code does not perform any dynamic execution, data leaks, or other malicious activities. It appears to be standard testing code for a Python utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for a utility function with no malicious intent, no security risks, and no suspicious behavior detected. It is safe and standard in nature.",
