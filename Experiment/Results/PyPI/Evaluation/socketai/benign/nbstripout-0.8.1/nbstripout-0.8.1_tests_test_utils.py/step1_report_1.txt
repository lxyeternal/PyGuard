{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the 'pop_recursive' utility function in the 'nbstripout._utils' module, designed to verify its correct behavior in manipulating nested dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data from functions 'make_dict' and 'make_data', and the 'd' fixture provides a nested dictionary. No external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into or out of the code, as the code only performs in-memory data manipulation within test cases.",
  "flows": "The test functions call 'pop_recursive' with different keys and default values, which process the nested dictionary 'd'. There are no external data flows or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard testing patterns, and the 'pop_recursive' function's internal behavior is not shown but presumed safe as a utility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest-based test suite. It tests the functionality of 'pop_recursive' by setting up dictionaries and expected outcomes. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O beyond tests, or any other potentially malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign test suite for a dictionary utility function. It does not contain malware, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It merely tests expected functionality.",
