  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code under review is a set of pytest-based unit tests for a utility function `pop_recursive` that manipulates nested dictionaries.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, uses standard testing patterns, and involves no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The `malware` score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The `securityRisk` score is also 0, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code only performs in-memory data manipulations within a test framework.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or potential vulnerabilities are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data from external sources, nor does it perform any dynamic code execution or network operations.\n- The tests verify the correctness of `pop_recursive` by asserting expected outcomes, which is standard practice.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- The `malware` score is appropriately 0; there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, as the code poses no security threats.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the reports are consistent and thorough, and the code is benign, no changes to scores are necessary.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is safe and intended solely for testing.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and justified. The code is a standard, safe test suite with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
