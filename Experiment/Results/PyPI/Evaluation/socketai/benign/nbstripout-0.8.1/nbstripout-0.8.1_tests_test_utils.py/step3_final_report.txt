{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based unit tests for the 'pop_recursive' utility function, verifying its behavior on nested dictionaries with various keys and default values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from internal functions and fixtures, manipulating in-memory nested dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not perform external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The tests invoke 'pop_recursive' with specific keys and compare the returned result to expected values, then verify the remaining dictionary state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite for a dictionary utility function, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All tests verify expected behavior without side effects. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are detected. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, and the confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and justified, indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
