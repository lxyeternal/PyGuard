{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the 'pop_recursive' utility function in the 'nbstripout._utils' module, aiming to verify its behavior in manipulating nested dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pytest' and 'nbstripout._utils', and the test functions that generate data and perform assertions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or malicious effects; the code only performs dictionary manipulations and assertions within a testing framework.",
  "flows": "Input data from test functions flows into 'pop_recursive' calls, which modify the input dictionaries; results are compared against expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward test code for a utility function. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and a utility function. It defines helper functions to generate test data and a nested dictionary. Test cases use parameterized tests to verify 'pop_recursive' behavior with various keys and default values. The tests assert correctness of the returned values and ensure the original dictionaries are correctly modified. No network activity, system modification, or obfuscated code present. The code is standard testing code, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a utility function manipulating nested dictionaries. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
