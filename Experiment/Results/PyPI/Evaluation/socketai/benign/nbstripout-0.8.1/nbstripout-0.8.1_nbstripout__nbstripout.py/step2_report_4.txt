  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a legitimate utility to strip notebook output, manage git filters, and attributes. It uses subprocess calls to git for configuration, and handles files safely. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent with the analysis. The low risk score accounts for the use of subprocesses, which is standard for such tools but could, in theory, be misused if git configs are compromised.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. No issues found. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code manages git filters and processes notebooks without suspicious activity. The potential concern about data flow is minimal since no network or code injection is involved.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate. The use of subprocesses for git commands is standard, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No malware or obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the core functions of processing notebooks and managing git configs. Again, no signs of malicious activity. The extensive use of git commands is typical for such tools.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly higher risk score, possibly reflecting the extensive git configuration manipulation, but still justified given the controlled nature.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the script manages git filters and processes notebooks without malicious intent. The subprocess calls are standard, and no suspicious activities are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a legitimate utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code performs expected tasks with no malicious activity. The subprocess calls for git configuration are typical and controlled.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code only interacts with git configurations, files, and notebooks.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) due to subprocess calls, but these are standard for such tools and do not pose significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** Given the use of subprocess for git configuration, a small risk score (~0.1–0.2) is justified but not indicative of any security threat.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis utility is a legitimate, non-malicious tool for managing notebook outputs in version control workflows.",
