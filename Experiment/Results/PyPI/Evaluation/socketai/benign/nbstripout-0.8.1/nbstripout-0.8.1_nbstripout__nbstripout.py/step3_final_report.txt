{
  "purpose": "The script manages the stripping of output from Jupyter and IPython notebooks, and sets up or removes git filters and attributes to automate this process in version control workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook files (.ipynb, .zpln), git configuration outputs, and user input streams.",
  "sinks": "Writes stripped notebooks back to files or stdout, modifies git attributes and configuration files.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook data, processes it to remove outputs, and writes back; executes subprocess calls to configure git filters; reads and writes configuration files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation. Uses subprocess calls for standard git configuration management.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate operations: managing git filters via subprocess, reading and writing notebook files with nbformat/json, and handling configuration files safely. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are controlled and typical for such setup scripts. The logic is straightforward, with proper exception handling. No hidden or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for stripping notebook outputs and managing git filters. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily involving configuration file manipulations, which are standard for such tools.",
