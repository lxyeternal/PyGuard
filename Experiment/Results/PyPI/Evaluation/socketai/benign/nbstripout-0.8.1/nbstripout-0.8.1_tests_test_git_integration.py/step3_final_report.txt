{
  "purpose": "The code comprises pytest test functions verifying the installation, configuration, and uninstallation processes of the 'nbstripout' tool, which manages git filters for Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads (configuration files, attributes), subprocess calls to 'git' and 'nbstripout', and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed into system commands or files in a malicious way; outputs are checked against expected patterns.",
  "flows": "System commands ('git', 'nbstripout') are executed, their outputs are captured and validated, and configuration files are read to verify states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a CLI tool managing git attributes for notebooks. It performs standard filesystem operations, subprocess executions, and output assertions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is justified by the use of external commands, but no vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured testing logic with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
