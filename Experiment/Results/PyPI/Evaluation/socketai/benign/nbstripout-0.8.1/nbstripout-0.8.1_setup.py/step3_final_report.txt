{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'nbstripout' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static dependencies and metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The 'license' field is a string resembling a classifier ('License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License'), which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward use of setuptools to configure package installation. It reads a local README file, specifies dependencies, author info, URL, classifiers, and entry points. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The only minor issue is the misuse of the 'license' field as a string resembling a classifier, which is a configuration inconsistency but not security-related. All indicators point to benign, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
