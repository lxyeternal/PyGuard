{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'nbstripout' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; defining install_requires list; reading file contents",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external inputs that could lead to security issues",
  "flows": "Reading the README file content to use as long_description; passing static metadata and dependencies to setup() function",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. The license field appears incorrectly specified with a classifier string instead of an SPDX identifier.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup tools, reads a README file for the package description, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for CLI. It performs standard setup configuration with no dynamic code execution, no external inputs besides static file read, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of 'license' as a string that resembles a classifier is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward setup script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script used for packaging. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The code is clear, with no anomalies that suggest sabotage or malware.",
