{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'nbstripout' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; defining dependencies in 'install_requires'; retrieving main function via 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily sets up package metadata and scripts.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading files and defining package info to passing data to setup(). No untrusted data flows to execution or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of standard setuptools functions and attributes.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata and configuration. All operations are typical for Python package setup. No hardcoded credentials, no network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The license specified is MIT, and the code uses well-known setuptools functions. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs package configuration and metadata setup typical for Python projects.",
