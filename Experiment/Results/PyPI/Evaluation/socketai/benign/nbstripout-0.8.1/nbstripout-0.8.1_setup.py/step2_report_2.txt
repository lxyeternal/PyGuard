  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard setup script for the 'nbstripout' Python package.\n- No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The code reads a README.md for the long description, specifies dependencies, and configures package metadata.\n- No external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The only minor issue noted is the 'license' field being a string that resembles a classifier, but this is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. All reports agree that the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious code or backdoors?** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns?** None detected.\n- **Use of untrusted data or external calls?** No.\n- **Any anomalies?** Slight misconfiguration of the 'license' field, but not malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, also appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since the code is straightforward, static, and uses standard practices, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Given the consistency and the nature of the code, I concur with the reports' evaluations.**\n\n**However, considering the importance of thoroughness, I will assign the following scores:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious activity or code detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear, straightforward, and un-obfuscated.          |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or external threats.       |\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign setup script with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n- The 'license' field could be corrected to an SPDX identifier, but this is a minor configuration issue, not a security risk.\n- No changes needed to the scores based on the current evidence.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all reports and the code's nature.",
