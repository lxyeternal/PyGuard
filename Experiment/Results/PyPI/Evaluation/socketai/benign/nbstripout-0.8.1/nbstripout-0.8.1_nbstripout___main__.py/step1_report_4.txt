{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the nbstripout package, likely to strip output from notebooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it calls a function from an imported package.",
  "sinks": "The main() function could potentially perform actions within nbstripout, such as modifying files or data, but no direct sink is evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of nbstripout -> execution of main() -> package functions operate on files or data, if any.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code only executes a single function from an imported package without additional logic. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports the main function from nbstripout and calls it immediately. Since nbstripout is a known utility for cleaning Jupyter notebooks, its main() function typically processes files or directories. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The minimal code structure reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. No suspicious side effects or data leaks are visible from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply runs the main function of nbstripout, a legitimate utility, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
