{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'nbstripout' package and executes it, likely to remove or clean Jupyter Notebook outputs.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from nbstripout import main' and the invocation 'main()' are the only data sources, reading the package code at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function call is a sink, executing code that may perform file operations or modifications within its scope.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported 'main' function (source) to its execution (sink). No external or untrusted input appears to influence this flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports and executes the 'main' function from 'nbstripout', a known utility for cleaning notebooks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's behavior depends entirely on 'nbstripout's implementation, which is a standard open-source tool. There are no external inputs, environment variables, or network operations in this snippet. The minimal code poses no apparent security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward invocation of a legitimate utility without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe based solely on this fragment.",
