  "conclusion": "The code is benign, executing a legitimate utility without signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal risk is due to potential side effects of 'main()', which are typical for such utilities. Overall, the code is safe for use in trusted environments."
