{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the main function from the nbstripout package, likely to perform its primary functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from nbstripout package, call to main() function",
  "sinks": "The call to main() could potentially execute code within nbstripout that reads or processes data",
  "flows": "Import from nbstripout -> execution of main() -> potential data processing or modification within nbstripout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed; the code simply invokes a package's main function",
  "analysis": "The code imports the main function from the nbstripout package and calls it directly. No additional logic, input handling, or data manipulation is present. Since nbstripout is an open-source package used for stripping output cells from notebooks, its main() function generally performs this task. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script simply executes the main function of the nbstripout package. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code fragment.",
