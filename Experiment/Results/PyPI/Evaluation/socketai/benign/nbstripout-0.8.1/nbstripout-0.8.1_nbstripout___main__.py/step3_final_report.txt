{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'nbstripout' package, which is used for removing output cells from Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'main' from 'nbstripout'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function may modify notebook files in the current directory, potentially causing file changes.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'main()', which may read and modify notebook files in the environment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No external inputs or network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple invocation of a known utility function intended for cleaning notebooks. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident. The 'main()' function's side effects are consistent with its purpose and are not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are appropriate given the benign nature of the utility. The potential risk stems from file modifications, which are expected and not malicious. The confidence in these conclusions is high, as the code is straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, executing a legitimate utility without signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The minimal risk is due to potential side effects of 'main()', which are typical for such utilities. Overall, the code is safe for use in trusted environments.",
