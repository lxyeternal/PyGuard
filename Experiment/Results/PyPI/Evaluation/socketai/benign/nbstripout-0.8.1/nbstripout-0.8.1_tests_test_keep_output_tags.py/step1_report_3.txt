{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the functionality of nbstripout's output stripping from Jupyter notebooks, including handling of exceptions.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook files ('test_keep_output_tags.ipynb' and 'test_keep_output_tags_exception.ipynb') from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook files -> Processes notebook data with strip_output -> Checks outputs and exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard library functions, known testing frameworks, and no suspicious or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and testing libraries, reads specific notebook files, and applies the strip_output function. It tests output presence based on regex-matched cell sources and expects an exception in one test. All operations are typical for a test suite and do not involve network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test script for a notebook processing utility. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It simply reads files, processes data, and performs assertions.",
