{
  "purpose": "The code is for testing the functionality of the 'nbstripout' library, specifically for stripping outputs from Jupyter notebooks while optionally keeping certain outputs based on tags.",
  "sources": "File reading via 'nbformat.read' to load notebook files from disk; usage of 'os.path.join' to construct file paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written or executed; the code does not write data, execute commands, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code reads notebook files into memory, processes them with 'strip_output', and performs assertions; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is primarily standard test code using pytest and nbformat.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and the 'nbstripout' package. It defines fixtures to load notebook files from disk and contains test functions to validate output stripping. There is no code execution from untrusted sources, no network activity, no manipulation of environment variables, and no suspicious code patterns. The logic is straightforward, focused on testing notebook output stripping functionality. No obfuscated or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code for a notebook output management library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
