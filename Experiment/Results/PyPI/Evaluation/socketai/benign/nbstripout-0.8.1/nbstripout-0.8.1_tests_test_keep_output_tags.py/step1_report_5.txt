{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the functionality of a notebook output stripping utility, verifying that outputs are correctly removed or preserved based on tags, and handling exceptions appropriately.",
  "sources": "The code reads notebook files ('test_keep_output_tags.ipynb' and 'test_keep_output_tags_exception.ipynb') from the filesystem using nbformat.read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data leading to potential data leaks, system commands, or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code reads notebook files (sources), processes them with strip_output (which manipulates notebook cells), and performs assertions to verify correct behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no hidden or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines fixtures to load notebook files. It then defines test functions that manipulate copies of notebooks, applying strip_output to remove or keep outputs based on cell tags. The tests check the presence or absence of outputs, and handle expected exceptions. All code uses straightforward, standard testing practices without any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a notebook output management utility, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and does not exhibit malware behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
