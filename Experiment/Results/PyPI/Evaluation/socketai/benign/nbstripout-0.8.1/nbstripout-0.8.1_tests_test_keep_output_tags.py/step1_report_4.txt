{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of tests for the nbstripout package, used to strip output from Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads notebook files using nbformat.read() from specified file paths within the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data for effect or leakage; it primarily reads files and calls functions from the nbstripout library.",
  "flows": "The data flows from reading notebook files (sources) into functions that manipulate notebook objects (strip_output), with no further untrusted data handling or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code relies on external files and standard libraries only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, including nbformat and pytest, to perform unit tests on notebook objects. It reads test notebooks from the filesystem, deep copies notebook objects, and applies the strip_output function from nbstripout. It then verifies expected output removal or exception raising. No untrusted data processing, network activities, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward test code for a known library, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing script for the nbstripout library, performing file reading, object copying, function calls, and assertions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks.",
