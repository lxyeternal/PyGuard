  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code is a test suite for the `nbstripout` library, which strips output from Jupyter notebooks.\n- It reads specific notebook files (`test_keep_output_tags.ipynb` and `test_keep_output_tags_exception.ipynb`) from disk.\n- It applies `strip_output()` to notebook objects, then performs assertions on the output cells.\n- One test expects an exception (`MetadataError`) when processing a particular notebook.\n- The code uses standard libraries (`os`, `re`, `deepcopy`, `pytest`, `nbformat`) and the `nbstripout` package.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward test suite.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- It relies on external files for tests, which is typical and not suspicious.\n- No untrusted data is written or executed.\n- The core logic is safe and standard for testing.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The tests seem well-structured, and the use of `deepcopy` prevents side effects.\n- The only potential concern is dependency on external test files, but that is standard in testing environments.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower. The code is a test suite with no security risks.\n\nThe reports' assigned scores are consistent with this assessment, all indicating no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware:** 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is readable and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.5, as it's test code with no security impact.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n- The code is a benign test suite for a notebook output stripper.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious activity detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Clear, standard code.                                          |\n| Security Risk  | 0.0 to 0.2        | No security risks identified; standard testing code.          |\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, and the scores should reflect that.",
