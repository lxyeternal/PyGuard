{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the nbstripout utility, which strips output from Jupyter notebooks. It reads notebook files, applies output stripping, and verifies expected behaviors.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook files from disk ('test_keep_output_tags.ipynb' and 'test_keep_output_tags_exception.ipynb') using nbformat.read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; the code only manipulates in-memory notebook objects and performs assertions.",
  "flows": "Reads notebooks -> applies strip_output -> checks cell outputs and exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; reliance on external files is standard for testing and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a utility that manipulates notebook outputs. It uses standard libraries and performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The tests verify output removal and exception handling. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
