{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for a function that strips output from Jupyter notebook cells, likely for cleaning or anonymizing notebooks before sharing or version control.",
  "sources": "The code reads notebook files ('test_keep_output_tags.ipynb' and 'test_keep_output_tags_exception.ipynb') from the filesystem using nbformat.read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data or send data over the network; it mainly manipulates notebook data structures in memory.",
  "flows": "Input notebook files are loaded, then deep-copied, and the strip_output function is applied. No untrusted data is passed directly into sensitive sinks; the code is primarily read and test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only notable aspect is reliance on external files for tests, which is standard for testing frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, sets up test fixtures for reading notebooks, and defines test functions that modify notebook objects and check conditions. The core logic involves no network activity, code injection, or data leakage. It uses regular expressions to match comments in code cells, which is safe. The presence of a test that expects an exception from strip_output suggests validation of error handling but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose appears solely related to testing notebook output stripping functionality without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a notebook output stripping utility, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It handles data in memory and performs standard file I/O for tests. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
