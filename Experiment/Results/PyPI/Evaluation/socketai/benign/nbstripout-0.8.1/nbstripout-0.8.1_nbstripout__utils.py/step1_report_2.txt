{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for manipulating and cleaning Jupyter notebook files, including removing outputs, metadata, and filtering cells based on conditions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from notebook objects, including cells, metadata, and attributes like 'source', 'outputs', 'metadata', 'tags', 'paragraphs'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifying notebook content (cells, metadata). No untrusted data sinks like network I/O or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from notebook object -> conditional filtering and metadata manipulation -> modification of cells and metadata (removal of outputs, ids, counts).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors; functions are straightforward and related to notebook content management. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on manipulating notebook structures: removing outputs, filtering cells, and managing metadata. The functions use safe, standard Python operations. No evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. The only minor concern could be that it modifies notebook content, but this is consistent with a utility library. No hardcoded credentials, external calls, or data exfiltration methods are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for cleaning and filtering Jupyter notebooks, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. The code structure and logic are straightforward and standard.",
