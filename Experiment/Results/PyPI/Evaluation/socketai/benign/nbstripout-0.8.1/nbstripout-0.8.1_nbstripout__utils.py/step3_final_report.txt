  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating Jupyter notebooks, including removing outputs, handling nested metadata keys, filtering cells, and managing cell IDs and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads notebook structures, cell metadata, and cell content; accesses nested dictionaries and lists.",
  "sinks": "Modifies notebook data structures in-place; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads notebook and cell data; modifies outputs, metadata, cell IDs, and tags within the data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard Python features and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard notebook sanitization tasks such as removing outputs, stripping metadata, filtering cells based on tags or content, and handling nested dictionary keys. It does not include any network activity, external system calls, or obfuscated code. The functions are well-structured, with clear purpose and no suspicious patterns. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for notebook data cleaning and manipulation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the low threat level.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
