{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for manipulating Jupyter notebooks, such as removing outputs, handling nested dictionary keys, and filtering cells based on conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads notebook data structures (`nb`, `cell`, `metadata`, etc.), especially in functions like `strip_output`, `_cells`, and `determine_keep_output`.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `sys.stderr.write` for logging invalid keys and the `pop_recursive` function that removes nested metadata keys, but these are standard behaviors. No untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input notebook objects through various filtering and modification functions, ultimately returning modified notebook structures. No untrusted data sources are used for sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. Functions operate on notebook metadata and cells in a standard manner. No suspicious code snippets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for processing Jupyter notebooks, including removing outputs, handling metadata, and filtering cells based on tags or content. All functions perform legitimate data manipulations, with proper handling of nested metadata and cell structures. The `pop_recursive` function manages nested dictionaries securely. The logging of invalid keys is a common practice and does not indicate malicious intent. No code performs network operations, system modifications, or other malicious activities. The overall structure suggests safe, intended behavior for notebook sanitization and processing.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a legitimate utility library for Jupyter notebook processing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The security risk score is low, and malware likelihood is minimal.",
