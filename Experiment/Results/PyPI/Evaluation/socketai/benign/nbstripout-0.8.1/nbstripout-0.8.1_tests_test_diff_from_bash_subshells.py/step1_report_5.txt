{
  "purpose": "The code defines test functions for comparing Jupyter notebooks using bash commands with diff and nbstripout, to verify output consistency.",
  "sources": "Path variables for test notebook files, sys.platform check, pytester.run() commands executing bash with diff and nbstripout commands.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code executes external shell commands, but only with fixed command strings and file paths.",
  "flows": "Input data from file paths (NOTEBOOKS_FOLDER / filename), passed into bash commands; output captured via pytester.run() but not used in a vulnerable way.",
  "anomalies": "Use of process substitution `<()` in shell commands on Unix systems; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up test cases using pytest to run bash shell commands that perform diff operations on notebook files after processing with nbstripout. It skips tests on Windows due to shell compatibility. No user input or untrusted data is involved; only static file paths are used in the commands. The commands execute external processes but do so with fixed strings, reducing risk. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code leverages standard testing practices without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test suite for comparing notebook files using shell commands; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It uses safe, controlled commands with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
