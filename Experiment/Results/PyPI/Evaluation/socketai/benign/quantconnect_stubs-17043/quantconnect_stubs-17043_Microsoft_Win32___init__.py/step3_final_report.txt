  "purpose": "Environment setup for Python/.NET interop within the QuantConnect Lean platform, manipulating sys.path and modules to ensure correct assembly loading.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__, manipulating sys.path, deleting sys.modules entries, importing clr and Microsoft.Win32 modules.",
  "sinks": "Loading the Microsoft.Win32 assembly via AddReference, importing from Microsoft.Win32.",
  "flows": "Path traversal to locate directories -> removal of specific sys.path entries -> deletion of sys.modules['Microsoft.Win32'] -> AddReference to load assembly -> import from Microsoft.Win32.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules, but controlled and targeted for environment configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup by adjusting sys.path to avoid conflicting stub modules, deletes the existing module to force re-import, and explicitly loads a .NET assembly using Python.NET's AddReference. No malicious payloads, secrets, or network activity are present. The manipulations are advanced but legitimate in complex interop scenarios. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, environment-specific purpose. No errors or malicious intent are evident; the code is transparent and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, environment-specific setup script for Python-.NET interop, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The low scores are appropriate and justified.",
