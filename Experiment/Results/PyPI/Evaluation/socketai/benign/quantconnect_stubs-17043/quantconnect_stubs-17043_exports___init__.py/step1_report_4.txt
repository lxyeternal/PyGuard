  "purpose": "Adjust sys.path to correctly load the 'exports' module from a specific directory for a .NET integration in a QuantConnect Lean environment.",
  "sources": "File system paths (os.path.dirname, current directory), sys.path modifications, __file__ variable, import statements",
  "sinks": "Importing 'exports' module via AddReference from clr, dynamic sys.path manipulation",
  "flows": "Determine directory, modify sys.path, remove 'exports' if present, import 'AddReference', import everything from 'exports', restore sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Temporary removal of sys.path entries and deletion of sys.modules entries to manipulate module loading, no obvious malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily managing Python and .NET interop environment. It locates the 'exports' directory relative to the current script, temporarily alters sys.path to prevent importing an incorrect module, and explicitly loads a .NET assembly using clr.AddReference. The process appears to be aimed at ensuring the correct version of the 'exports' module is loaded, likely in a specialized trading environment. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code's complexity is justified by environment-specific needs rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script manages environment-specific module loading for a .NET integration in a trading environment, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, environment-aware setup routine.",
