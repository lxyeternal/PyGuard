  "purpose": "The code modifies sys.path to import a specific C# namespace via Python.NET, ensuring the correct implementation is used when running Lean locally.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's directory via __file__, modifies sys.path, and dynamically imports modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses AddReference to load a C# assembly, then imports the 'exports' module from it.",
  "flows": "Script determines directory paths, temporarily alters sys.path, deletes module references, adds a C# reference, imports the namespace, and restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic modification of sys.path and deletion of modules could be used to obfuscate malicious imports or behavior, but appear justified for the environment setup. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script searches for a specific directory ('exports') relative to its location, then removes that directory from sys.path to prevent unintended module loading. It deletes the 'exports' module from sys.modules to force a fresh import. Using AddReference from Python.NET to load a C# assembly named 'exports' suggests cross-language integration. The code then imports everything from 'exports' and restores sys.path. The overall logic is to ensure the correct C# implementation is used in a specific environment, with no signs of malicious intent or data leakage. The pattern is somewhat dynamic but consistent with environment setup procedures.\n\nNo suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The use of dynamic path modifications is typical for complex build or runtime environments and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs environment setup for correct module importation in a Python/C# hybrid context. There are no indications of malicious activity, data theft, or sabotage. The dynamic path adjustments are typical for such integration scripts and do not suggest malicious intent.",
