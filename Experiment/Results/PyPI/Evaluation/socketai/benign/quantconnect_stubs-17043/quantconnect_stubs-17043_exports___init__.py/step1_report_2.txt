{
  "purpose": "The code modifies sys.path to control module import behavior, specifically to ensure the correct C# namespace is used when running Lean locally with quantconnect-stubs.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine directory paths, sys.path for module search paths, and the module import process including 'clr' and 'exports'.",
  "sinks": "Importing 'AddReference' from 'clr' and importing from 'exports' could influence runtime behavior and module loading, but do not directly involve untrusted data or external system effects.",
  "flows": "__file__ path -> directory traversal -> sys.path modification -> import of clr and exports modules -> calling AddReference('exports') -> restoring sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "The code manipulates sys.path dynamically and deletes 'exports' from sys.modules to control import behavior. This can be considered unusual but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully identifies a specific directory ('exports') to modify sys.path, temporarily removes it to prevent package interference, deletes the 'exports' module from sys.modules, and then uses clr.AddReference to load the 'exports' assembly. Afterwards, sys.path is restored. All operations are related to controlling import order and module resolution for a specific environment. No external data, credentials, or malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to manipulate the import process to ensure correct assembly referencing in a specific environment. It does not exhibit malicious intent, nor does it perform malicious actions or contain malware indicators. The operations are technical and environment-specific, with no evident security risks.",
