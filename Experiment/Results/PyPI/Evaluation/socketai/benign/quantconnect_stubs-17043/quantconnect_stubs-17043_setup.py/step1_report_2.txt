{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for 'quantconnect-stubs', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'setup()' function call, including string variables, list literals for classifiers, install_requires, packages, and package_data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; all data are static strings, lists, and package metadata within the setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data are statically defined within the script, used solely for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard setup script with extensive package listings and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines a 'long_description' string detailing the package purpose. The 'setup()' call specifies package metadata, dependencies, and comprehensive package data mappings. All data are static, non-dynamic, and intended for package configuration. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network connections, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup, and all data are explicitly declared.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It contains extensive package listings and metadata, which are typical for such configuration files. No malicious or security-risk elements are detected.",
