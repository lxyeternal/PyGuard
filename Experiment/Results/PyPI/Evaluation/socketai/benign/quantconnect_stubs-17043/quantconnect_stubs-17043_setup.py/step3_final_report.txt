  "purpose": "Static package setup configuration for the 'quantconnect-stubs' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Package metadata, package list, and static data declarations within setup.py",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data flows, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "None; static data without external input or output flows",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with extensive package listings and metadata. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or secrets. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the script. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, well-structured, and typical for open-source Python packages. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are detected. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
