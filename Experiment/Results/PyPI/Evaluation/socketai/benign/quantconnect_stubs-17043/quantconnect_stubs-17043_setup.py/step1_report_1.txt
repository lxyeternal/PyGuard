{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'quantconnect-stubs', including metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata, package list, author info, dependencies, classifiers, long description, and package data files. No external inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or untrusted code execution are present. The script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Since there are no input sources, there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code strictly performs static configuration tasks. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to specify package details, including metadata, package lists, classifiers, dependencies, and package data. All data appears static and typical for a package setup script. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. There is no code that performs operations beyond static configuration, and no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent. It only defines package metadata and data for distribution, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
