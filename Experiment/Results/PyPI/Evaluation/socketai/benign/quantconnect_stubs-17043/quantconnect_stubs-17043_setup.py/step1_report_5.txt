{
  "purpose": "The script defines the setup configuration for the 'quantconnect-stubs' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data (long_description), metadata fields (name, version, description, author, url), and a comprehensive list of package names in 'packages' and 'package_data'. No user input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that process or output untrusted data, or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the script solely declares package metadata and structure without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with extensive package listings. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. All package names appear legitimate and aligned with a known open-source package for QuantConnect.",
  "analysis": "A straightforward setup configuration script for packaging Python modules. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only data is static metadata and package lists, which are typical for Python distribution packages. No external data input, no network operations, no secrets or credentials embedded. The code is well-structured, with standard use of setuptools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. It is a standard package configuration file for distributing the 'quantconnect-stubs' package. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
