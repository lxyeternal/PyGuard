{
  "purpose": "Defines a setup configuration for a Python package containing type stubs for QuantConnect's Lean engine, primarily for development support and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Reads static string data for long_description, package names and data, and metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "The setup function processes static data; no untrusted input or external data sources are used that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows are present; all data is statically defined within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging, with comprehensive listing of packages and package data. It uses static, predefined strings and lists for package configuration. No external input, no dynamic code execution, and no network calls are present. The purpose is purely package metadata and structure definition. No suspicious or malicious activity is detectable based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script for a Python package. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The package appears to be for development purposes, providing type stubs for an open-source project. No security concerns are identified.",
