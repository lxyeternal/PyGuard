  "purpose": "Configure the Python environment to correctly import the QuantConnect.Util namespace for running Lean locally, avoiding conflicts with the quantconnect-stubs package.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file path (__file__), accessing sys.path, importing modules (clr, QuantConnect.Util)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; no network, file, or environment variable operations observed",
  "flows": "sys.path modification (removing and restoring paths), importing modules (clr, QuantConnect.Util), namespace re-importation",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically modifies sys.path to control module import behavior, which can be risky if manipulated maliciously; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The script identifies the directory containing 'quantconnect-stubs' relative to the script's location, then temporarily removes this directory from sys.path to ensure proper namespace resolution. It then deletes a module from sys.modules to force re-import of the C# namespace via Python.NET's AddReference, before restoring sys.path. This approach is specific to managing import conflicts in a specialized environment, with no indications of malicious intent. The code manipulates sys.path and module imports dynamically, which, while potentially risky if misused, appears to serve a legitimate purpose in environment setup. No external data or network operations are performed, nor are there signs of data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended to manage environment setup for QuantConnect's Lean platform by handling namespace imports properly. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident; it appears as a legitimate configuration script with controlled environment modifications.",
