  "purpose": "Adjust the Python environment to correctly reference the QuantConnect C# namespace when running locally, by temporarily modifying sys.path and importing the necessary C# assembly.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__, os.path functions, sys.path modifications, import statements, and clr.AddReference",
  "sinks": "Adding reference to 'QuantConnect.Util' and importing from it",
  "flows": "Determine path -> modify sys.path -> import C# assembly -> restore sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Temporary sys.path modifications, removing modules from sys.modules, and manipulating the import process",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically finds the directory containing the 'QuantConnect' project, then temporarily removes the 'quantconnect-stubs' directory from sys.path to prevent conflicts. It then forcibly deletes the 'QuantConnect.Util' module from sys.modules to ensure a fresh import, adds a reference to the C# assembly 'QuantConnect.Util' via Python.NET, and finally imports the C# namespace. Afterward, it restores sys.path to its original state. This process is intended to ensure correct namespace resolution when running locally. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection is evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose within a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment setup routine for working with QuantConnect's C# libraries within Python, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. Its temporary sys.path modifications and module manipulations are typical in such inter-language integration scenarios.",
