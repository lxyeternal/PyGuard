  "purpose": "Environment setup for interop between Python and C# in the QuantConnect Lean framework, ensuring correct assembly loading and namespace import.",
  "sources": "Directory traversal to locate 'QuantConnect', sys.path manipulation, deletion of 'QuantConnect.Util' from sys.modules, and use of clr.AddReference to load the C# assembly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only manipulates environment paths and modules for setup purposes.",
  "flows": "Locates directory -> removes specific path from sys.path -> deletes module from sys.modules -> adds assembly reference via clr.AddReference -> imports namespace -> restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic sys.path modification and module deletion, which could be risky if environment is compromised, but are standard in controlled environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup for Python-C# interop, using directory traversal, sys.path adjustment, module deletion, and assembly referencing. No malicious activity, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The techniques are typical for complex inter-language environments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior, reflecting low risk and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment setup routine with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
