  "purpose": "Adjust the Python environment to correctly import C# components for the QuantConnect Lean engine by manipulating sys.path and module imports.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), reads and modifies sys.path, and imports from clr and QuantConnect.Util.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies sys.path and module imports which could influence module loading behavior.",
  "flows": "Determines the directory, temporarily modifies sys.path, deletes a module from sys.modules, adds a .NET reference, then restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules to control module import behavior; no obvious hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code identifies the QuantConnect directory, temporarily removes its path from sys.path to avoid conflicts, and imports a C# assembly via clr.AddReference. It then imports relevant components and restores sys.path. This pattern appears designed to ensure correct assembly loading rather than malicious behavior. No data leakage, external network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of sys.path modification is a common practice in complex environment setups, not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended for environment setup within the QuantConnect Lean framework and does not exhibit malicious intent. It manipulates import paths to ensure proper module loading, which is a typical pattern in managed environments. No malware or security risks are identified.",
