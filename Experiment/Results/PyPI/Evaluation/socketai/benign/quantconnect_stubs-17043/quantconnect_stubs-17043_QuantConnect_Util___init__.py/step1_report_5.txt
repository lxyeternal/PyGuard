  "purpose": "Adjusts sys.path to ensure correct module importation for QuantConnect Lean local execution.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's directory (__file__), modifies sys.path, and imports modules via clr.AddReference.",
  "sinks": "Importing modules and manipulating sys.path; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Determines the path to 'QuantConnect' directory -> temporarily modifies sys.path -> imports .NET assembly references -> restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic sys.path modifications and re-importing modules, which could be exploited for malicious imports if manipulated, but appears intended for environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically locates the 'QuantConnect' directory relative to the current file, modifies sys.path to exclude it temporarily, then uses Python.NET's clr.AddReference to load a specific .NET assembly. Afterwards, sys.path is restored. This process is typical in environments that combine Python and .NET, especially in financial or backtesting setups. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The dynamic sys.path manipulation could be a concern if the directory structure is manipulated maliciously, but within expected use, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs environment setup for QuantConnect Lean execution, with no apparent malicious intent. The sys.path modifications are typical for integrating Python with .NET assemblies. No malware signals detected; risks are minimal but rely on controlled directory structure.",
