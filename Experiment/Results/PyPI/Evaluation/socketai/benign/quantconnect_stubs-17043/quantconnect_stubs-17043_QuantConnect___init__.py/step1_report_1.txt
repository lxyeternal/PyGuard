  "purpose": "Adjust sys.path to ensure correct importing of the QuantConnect namespace in a local Lean environment, avoiding conflicts with quantconnect-stubs installed via pip.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__, os.path operations, sys.path modifications, importing clr and QuantConnect modules",
  "sinks": "Importing modules from clr and QuantConnect, modifying sys.path and sys.modules",
  "flows": "Determining directory paths -> removing directory from sys.path -> deleting module from sys.modules -> importing clr and QuantConnect -> restoring sys.path",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code manipulates import paths for compatibility, which is a common practice in complex environments.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically adjusts sys.path to prevent conflicts between installed stub packages and actual implementations, then imports .NET references for QuantConnect. It restores sys.path afterward. No network, file, or credential operations are performed. It appears to be environment setup code, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script intended to manage import paths and references for the QuantConnect environment. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It is a benign utility for correct module loading.",
