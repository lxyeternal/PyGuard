  "purpose": "Adjust sys.path to ensure proper module import behavior for the QuantConnect LEAN framework when running locally.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine directory locations, importing os and sys modules, accessing sys.path for modification, importing clr and QuantConnect modules.",
  "sinks": "Using AddReference from clr to load C# assemblies, modifying sys.path to influence import behavior.",
  "flows": "Determining directory, removing path from sys.path, importing clr and QuantConnect, restoring sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "The code manipulates sys.path dynamically and deletes modules to control import behavior, which is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activities.",
  "analysis": "The script identifies its current directory, searches for a specific folder, modifies sys.path to exclude a certain directory, then imports C# references via Python.NET, and restores sys.path afterward. This is a controlled environment setup process. No external data input or untrusted sources involved. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity detected. The primary purpose appears to be environment setup for running the QuantConnect LEAN engine locally.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended for environment configuration, not malicious activity. It manipulates import paths to ensure proper module loading. No malware or security risks identified, though it involves unconventional sys.path modifications that could be risky if misused. Overall, low security concern.",
