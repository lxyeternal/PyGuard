{
  "purpose": "This code adjusts the Python environment to correctly reference C# libraries in the QuantConnect Lean algorithm framework, ensuring proper module loading for local execution.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory (__file__), accessing sys.path, and importing modules (clr, QuantConnect).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe modification of sys.path and dynamic module reloading which could be exploited to load malicious modules if manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "The code modifies sys.path to temporarily remove a directory, deletes a module from sys.modules, calls AddReference to load C# assemblies, then restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual manipulation of sys.path and module deletion to influence module import behavior; no explicit hardcoded secrets or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The script finds and modifies sys.path to control the import environment for the QuantConnect framework, ensuring correct referencing of C# assemblies. It carefully restores sys.path after modification. No code executes external commands or network activity, and the use of clr.AddReference is standard in Python.NET integration. The code’s purpose aligns with environment setup and does not exhibit malicious intent. No suspicious data handling or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate environment setup routine for a QuantConnect Lean project, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Its manipulations are typical for managing module references in a hybrid Python-C# environment.",
