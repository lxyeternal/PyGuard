{
  "purpose": "Configure Python environment for correct namespace resolution when running QuantConnect Lean locally, specifically handling import paths and C# references.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine directory structure; accessing sys.path for modifications; importing modules via clr and QuantConnect.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies sys.path and sys.modules, which can influence module resolution and execution environment.",
  "flows": "Determines directory, temporarily alters sys.path, deletes module cache, adds C# references, restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules to control import behavior; no user input handling or network activity; no embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code identifies its directory structure, modifies sys.path to exclude specific directories, deletes cached modules to enforce re-importation, and adds C# references via clr.AddReference. This is typical for integrating Python with C# in a controlled environment, particularly when dealing with hybrid Python-C# projects like QuantConnect Lean. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution are present. The code's purpose appears to be environment setup rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a QuantConnect environment, managing import paths and C# references. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, focusing solely on environment configuration.",
