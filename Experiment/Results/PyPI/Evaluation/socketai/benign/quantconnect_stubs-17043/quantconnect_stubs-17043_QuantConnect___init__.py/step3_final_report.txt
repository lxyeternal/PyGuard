{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically locates the 'QuantConnect' directory, temporarily removes the 'quantconnect-stubs' package path from sys.path, deletes the 'QuantConnect' module from sys.modules, adds a reference to the 'QuantConnect.Common' C# assembly via clr.AddReference, re-imports the QuantConnect namespace, and restores sys.path. Its purpose is to ensure correct assembly and module referencing in a local Lean environment, avoiding conflicts with stub packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory, searches for the 'QuantConnect' folder in the path, and manipulates sys.path and sys.modules to control import behavior.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; the code only modifies internal module and path references.",
  "flows": "The script finds the directory, removes the 'quantconnect-stubs' path from sys.path, deletes 'QuantConnect' from sys.modules, adds a C# assembly reference via clr.AddReference, imports 'QuantConnect', then restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules for environment setup, but this is standard in complex Python/.NET hybrid projects; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup for Python and C# interop in the QuantConnect Lean framework. It locates the relevant directory, temporarily modifies sys.path to prevent conflicts, deletes the module cache to ensure proper re-import, explicitly loads the C# assembly, and restores the environment. No network activity, embedded secrets, or suspicious behavior is present. The manipulation of import paths and module cache is controlled and typical for such scenarios. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment configuration routine used in Python/.NET hybrid projects like QuantConnect Lean. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
