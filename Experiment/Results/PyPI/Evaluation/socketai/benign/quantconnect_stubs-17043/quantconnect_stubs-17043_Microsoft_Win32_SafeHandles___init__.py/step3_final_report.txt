  "purpose": "Environment setup for Python.NET interop, managing sys.path and assembly references to ensure correct namespace usage in a complex trading platform environment.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories (locating 'Microsoft' directory), sys.path modifications, sys.modules deletion, clr.AddReference calls",
  "sinks": "Loading of .NET assemblies via AddReference, potential for assembly compromise if environment is maliciously manipulated",
  "flows": "Path traversal to locate directories -> sys.path removal and restoration -> module deletion from sys.modules -> AddReference to load assemblies",
  "anomalies": "None; standard environment configuration steps, no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal to locate specific folders, manipulates sys.path to control module import resolution, deletes modules to prevent conflicts, and loads .NET assemblies via clr.AddReference. These are typical for Python/.NET interop in controlled environments like QuantConnect. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The potential security concern is if the environment or assemblies are compromised, but the code itself is benign and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is environment setup for Python and .NET interop, with no malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting low inherent risk but acknowledging potential if environment is compromised.",
