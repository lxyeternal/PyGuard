  "purpose": "The code dynamically modifies sys.path to ensure correct importing of .NET assemblies in a Python environment, specifically for the Lean trading platform, by removing the package directory temporarily to avoid namespace conflicts, then restoring it afterward.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine directory structure, os.path and sys.path manipulations, import statements for clr and .NET assembly.",
  "sinks": "Use of sys.path removal and modification, dynamic import of .NET assembly via AddReference, re-importing modules.",
  "flows": "Determines directory, modifies sys.path, removes specific modules, adds .NET reference, then restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hidden code or unusual language features. The code manipulates sys.path and imports .NET assemblies dynamically, which is a common pattern in Python.NET integration but potentially risky if misused.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by determining a specific directory in the filesystem hierarchy relative to __file__. It then removes this directory from sys.path to prevent conflicts when importing a C# assembly via pythonnet's clr.AddReference. It explicitly deletes a module from sys.modules before adding a reference, which ensures clean import. After adding the reference, it restores sys.path to its original state. This pattern is typical for managing namespace conflicts in environments integrating .NET assemblies with Python. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security-sensitive operations such as network communication, credential handling, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for environment setup and namespace management in a Python.NET context. It does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs directory and module manipulations that are standard for this use case. There is no malware or security risk evident from this code segment.",
