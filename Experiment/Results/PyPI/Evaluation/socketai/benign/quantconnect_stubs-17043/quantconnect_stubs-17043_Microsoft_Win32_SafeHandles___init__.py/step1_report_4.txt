{
  "purpose": "This code manages the import process for a Python project that interacts with C# assemblies, specifically handling sys.path adjustments to ensure correct module resolution when running Lean locally with quantconnect-stubs.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory (__file__), sys.path, and the module import system (sys.modules).",
  "sinks": "The code modifies sys.path and sys.modules, then loads a specific .NET assembly ('Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles') using clr.AddReference.",
  "flows": "The code computes a directory path, temporarily modifies sys.path, deletes a specific module from sys.modules, calls AddReference to load a .NET assembly, then restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs complex sys.path manipulation and module deletion/re-import to control module resolution, which is somewhat unusual but appears justified for environment setup. No hardcoded credentials or malicious actions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script adjusts sys.path to locate and exclude the quantconnect-stubs package directory, preventing Python from resolving certain modules from that package. It deletes a specific module from sys.modules to force re-import or to prevent conflicts. The core action is calling AddReference to load a .NET assembly, which is standard in Python.NET integrations. The code appears to be a setup routine rather than malicious. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. Its complexity seems aimed at environment configuration rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled environment setup for a Python-C# interop scenario. It manipulates module paths and modules to ensure proper loading of .NET assemblies when running in a specific environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
