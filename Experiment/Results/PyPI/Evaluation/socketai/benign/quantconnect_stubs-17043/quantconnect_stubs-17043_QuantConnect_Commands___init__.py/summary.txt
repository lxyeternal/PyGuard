  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled environment setup script for Python-C# integration within QuantConnect Lean. It involves path manipulation and dynamic assembly referencing but does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal environmental risk. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain compromise."
