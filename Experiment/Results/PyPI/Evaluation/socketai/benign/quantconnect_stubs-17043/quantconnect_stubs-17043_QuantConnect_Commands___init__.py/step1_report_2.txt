  "purpose": "Adjust sys.path to correctly import C# components from the QuantConnect library in a local Lean environment.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), sys.path, sys.modules['QuantConnect.Commands']",
  "sinks": "AddReference('QuantConnect.Commands') import, sys.path modification and restoration",
  "flows": "Identify current path -> modify sys.path -> remove specific directory -> import C# namespace -> restore sys.path",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic manipulation of sys.path based on filesystem structure, removal and re-import of modules, no hardcoded credentials or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code finds the QuantConnect directory by traversing parent directories, then temporarily removes the directory containing 'quantconnect-stubs' from sys.path to ensure correct C# namespace referencing when using Python.NET. It then adds a reference to 'QuantConnect.Commands' and re-imports the module, finally restoring sys.path to its original state. No data leaks, no suspicious network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be a setup procedure for proper integration between Python and C# components in a local development environment. It manipulates import paths but does so in a controlled manner focused on environment setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment setup to facilitate correct importing of C# components for QuantConnect Lean. It involves path manipulation and module importation, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration script for development purposes.",
