  "purpose": "Adjust sys.path to ensure correct import of C# namespace for QuantConnect Lean local runs, avoiding interference from installed pip packages.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine current directory, accessing sys.path, importing modules (clr, QuantConnect.Commands).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows to critical actions or external systems.",
  "flows": "Determination of current directory -> modification of sys.path -> importing clr and QuantConnect.Commands -> restoration of sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of sys.path and module deletion for namespace resolution is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to locate the 'QuantConnect' directory, modify sys.path to exclude its path temporarily, import the C# assembly via AddReference, and then restore sys.path. It ensures that the Python.NET import references the correct C# namespace rather than pip-installed packages. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is focused on environment setup for a specific application context. The removal and restoration of sys.path, along with module deletion, are deliberate steps to prevent namespace conflicts. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment setup for a QuantConnect Lean local environment without malicious intent. It manipulates import paths for correct namespace referencing, which is a common technique in embedding C# assemblies in Python. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
