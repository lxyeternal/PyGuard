{
  "purpose": "The code locates the 'QuantConnect' directory, removes the 'quantconnect-stubs' path from sys.path to prevent import conflicts, dynamically loads the 'QuantConnect.Commands' C# assembly via Python.NET's AddReference, and restores sys.path. Its purpose is environment setup for Python-C# integration in QuantConnect Lean.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal to find 'QuantConnect' directory, sys.path modifications, module deletion, dynamic assembly loading via AddReference.",
  "sinks": "Importing and referencing the 'QuantConnect.Commands' C# assembly, which could affect runtime environment but not maliciously.",
  "flows": "Filesystem path discovery -> sys.path modification -> deletion of 'QuantConnect.Commands' module -> AddReference call -> import of C# namespace -> sys.path restoration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path manipulation and module deletion for environment setup; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal to locate the 'QuantConnect' folder, then removes the 'quantconnect-stubs' path from sys.path to avoid import conflicts. It deletes the existing 'QuantConnect.Commands' module if loaded, then uses Python.NET's AddReference to load the C# assembly 'QuantConnect.Commands'. It re-imports the namespace and restores sys.path. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; the code is a standard environment setup routine for Python-C# interop in QuantConnect Lean. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity is detected. The path manipulations are typical for such integrations but could be fragile if environment structure changes. Overall, the code is benign and serves a specific, controlled purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled environment setup script for Python-C# integration within QuantConnect Lean. It involves path manipulation and dynamic assembly referencing but does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal environmental risk. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
