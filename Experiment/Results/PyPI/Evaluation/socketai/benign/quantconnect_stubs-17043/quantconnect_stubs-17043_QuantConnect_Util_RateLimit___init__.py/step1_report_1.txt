{
  "purpose": "Adjust sys.path to ensure the correct version of the QuantConnect.Util.RateLimit module is imported, avoiding conflicts with the quantconnect-stubs package when running locally.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory (__file__), traverses directories to locate 'QuantConnect', and manipulates sys.path to control module import behavior.",
  "sinks": "The code imports modules and alters sys.path, but does not process or handle untrusted data or user inputs that could lead to data leaks or code injection.",
  "flows": "Locates 'QuantConnect' directory -> removes its path from sys.path -> imports specific C# module -> restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically modifies sys.path and deletes specific modules before importing. This is unusual but not inherently malicious; it's a targeted workaround for module resolution. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to fix module import behavior by manipulating sys.path to avoid conflicts between local implementations and package versions. It uses os.path operations to locate directories, then temporarily alters sys.path and sys.modules to ensure the correct module is loaded. No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious code such as network communications or system modifications are present. The approach is somewhat unconventional but appears to be a legitimate workaround, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for environment setup and module management, with no evidence of malicious intent. Its unusual sys.path manipulation is a deliberate workaround, not a sign of malware or security issues.",
