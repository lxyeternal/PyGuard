  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment setup routine for Python-C# interop within QuantConnect's framework. It involves path and module management to resolve dependency conflicts. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk scores are justified given the controlled environment and purpose."
