{
  "purpose": "The code manages sys.path to ensure correct import behavior of C# and Python modules in a QuantConnect Lean environment, specifically handling the 'quantconnect-stubs' package and related namespace imports.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine directory structure, accessing sys.path, importing modules and packages such as clr and QuantConnect.Benchmarks",
  "sinks": "Adding references via clr.AddReference, importing from QuantConnect.Benchmarks",
  "flows": "Determines directory, modifies sys.path, imports C# and Python modules, then restores sys.path",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; the code manipulates sys.path to control module loading order; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script identifies the path to the 'QuantConnect' directory, adjusts sys.path to prioritize local or specific package modules, then imports C# components via clr.AddReference, and restores sys.path. This is standard practice for Python.NET interop in environment setup. No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for environment setup and module import management in a QuantConnect Lean context. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The code is legitimate for its purpose.",
