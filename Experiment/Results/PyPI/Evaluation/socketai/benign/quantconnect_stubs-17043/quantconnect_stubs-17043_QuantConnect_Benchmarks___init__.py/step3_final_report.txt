{
  "purpose": "The code locates the 'QuantConnect' directory relative to the current file, temporarily removes the 'quantconnect-stubs' package directory from sys.path, deletes the 'QuantConnect.Benchmarks' module from sys.modules, adds a reference to the C# assembly 'QuantConnect.Benchmarks' via clr.AddReference, re-imports the namespace, and restores sys.path. Its purpose is to manage environment setup for Python-C# interop within QuantConnect's Lean framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory (__file__), searches for the 'QuantConnect' directory in the path, and manipulates sys.path and sys.modules to control import resolution.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies sys.path and sys.modules to influence module loading; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Source: directory path search and manipulation; Sink: sys.path modification and module re-imports; Flow: path search -> sys.path adjustment -> module deletion -> assembly reference addition -> module import -> sys.path restoration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual path traversal and dynamic module re-imports are present but are documented workarounds for environment-specific dependency management; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment setup for Python and C# interop, involving directory path searches, sys.path adjustments, and assembly referencing. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or handle sensitive data. The manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules is standard in complex interop scenarios, not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. The code's purpose is legitimate, and no security risks or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment setup routine for Python-C# interop within QuantConnect's framework. It involves path and module management to resolve dependency conflicts. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk scores are justified given the controlled environment and purpose.",
