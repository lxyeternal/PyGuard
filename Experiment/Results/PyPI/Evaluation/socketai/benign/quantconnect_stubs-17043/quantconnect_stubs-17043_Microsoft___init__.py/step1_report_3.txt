  "purpose": "Adjust sys.path to ensure correct importing of C# namespace when running Lean locally with quantconnect-stubs installed via pip.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.path.basename(current_path), sys.path, sys.modules",
  "sinks": "sys.path.remove(), del sys.modules, AddReference(\"Microsoft\"), import from Microsoft",
  "flows": "Determine directory -> Remove directory from sys.path -> Delete module from sys.modules -> AddReference -> Import Microsoft namespace",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules to influence module import behavior; no user input or untrusted data involved.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically identifies a specific directory related to 'quantconnect-stubs' and temporarily removes it from sys.path to prevent Python from importing the package instead of the intended C# implementation. It then deletes any existing 'Microsoft' module from sys.modules and explicitly adds a reference to the 'Microsoft' assembly using clr.AddReference, followed by importing from the namespace. This approach is a known pattern for managing Python.NET interop and does not appear malicious. It is focused on environment setup rather than data handling or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to configure the environment for correct C# namespace import when using Python.NET with Lean. It employs standard techniques for managing sys.path and module references. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is legitimate for its intended purpose.",
