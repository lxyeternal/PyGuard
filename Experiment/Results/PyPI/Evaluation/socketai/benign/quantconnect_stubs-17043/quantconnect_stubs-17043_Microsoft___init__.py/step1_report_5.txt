  "purpose": "Adjusts Python import paths to ensure the correct C# namespace is used when running Lean locally, specifically handling the 'quantconnect-stubs' package.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), directory traversal to locate 'Microsoft' folder, and manipulates sys.path and sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially affects module loading and namespace resolution, but no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Modifies sys.path to exclude certain directories, removes and re-imports modules, then restores sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Uses directory traversal and manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules to control import behavior, which can be risky if misused. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically locates a directory named 'Microsoft' in its path hierarchy, temporarily removes this directory from sys.path, deletes the 'Microsoft' module from sys.modules, and then calls AddReference to load a C# assembly. Afterwards, it restores sys.path. These steps are primarily for ensuring correct assembly loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious injections. The code operates within a controlled context to manage module imports, which is a known technique in interoperability scenarios. No suspicious or malicious intent is evident beyond managing import paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate path management routine used to control module import behavior in a specific environment. No malicious behavior or malware signs are detected. The manipulation of import paths appears to serve a technical purpose for correct runtime behavior.",
