  "purpose": "Environment setup for Python-C# interop in a QuantConnect Lean trading system, managing assembly references and import paths.",
  "sources": "os.path operations to locate directories, sys.path modifications, sys.modules deletion, clr.AddReference call, import statements.",
  "sinks": "Loading C# assemblies via AddReference, manipulating sys.path and sys.modules which affect module loading behavior.",
  "flows": "Locate 'Microsoft' directory -> remove from sys.path -> delete 'Microsoft' module from sys.modules -> call AddReference('Microsoft') -> import namespace -> restore sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path manipulation and module deletion for environment control; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; techniques are standard but somewhat unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment configuration to ensure correct assembly loading in a Python.NET context. It locates a specific directory, temporarily removes it from sys.path, deletes the 'Microsoft' module to force re-import, and loads the assembly via clr.AddReference. No malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The approach is typical for managing dependencies in complex interop scenarios. The manipulation of sys.path and modules, while potentially risky if misused, appears justified here. No vulnerabilities or malicious payloads are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment setup routine for Python and C# interop within a trading platform. It does not contain malicious activity or supply chain attacks. The techniques used are standard for such scenarios, and the low risk score reflects the minimal security concern. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
