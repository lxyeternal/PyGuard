  "purpose": "Define classes for sorting expressions with logical operators for combining them.",
  "sources": "None; no input or external data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no sources or sinks in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward class definitions and operator overloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class 'SortExpr' for creating sort expressions with logical AND (&) and OR (|) operators, allowing combination of expressions. The classes 'Asc' and 'Desc' extend 'SortExpr' for ascending and descending sort specifications, respectively. The methods involve standard Python type checks and list manipulations. There is no code that executes external commands, handles untrusted input, or communicates over a network. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, and the code appears to be purely for internal logic management without any harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of sorting expression classes with operator overloading. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
