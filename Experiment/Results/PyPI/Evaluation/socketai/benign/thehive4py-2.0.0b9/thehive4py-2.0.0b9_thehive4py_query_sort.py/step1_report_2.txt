  "purpose": "Defines classes for creating sortable expressions with logical operators",
  "sources": "Class instantiations and method calls; input fields provided during object creation",
  "sinks": "String operations for type errors; no untrusted data output or external system interaction",
  "flows": "Instantiation of Asc/Desc -> operator overloading (__and__, __or__) -> _concat_expressions -> return new SortExpr",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected; code appears standard for expression handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class SortExpr with logical operators & and | overloaded to combine sort expressions. The method _concat_expressions combines fields from two SortExpr objects, raising a TypeError if inputs are not instances of SortExpr. The Asc and Desc classes initialize with a field string, setting sorting order. There is no external data flow, system interaction, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and focused on constructing sort expressions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for constructing sorting expression objects with logical operators. No malicious or security risks are evident.",
