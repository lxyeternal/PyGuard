{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for constructing sort expressions, allowing logical combinations (AND, OR) of sorting fields with ascending or descending order.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'field' parameters provided to the Asc and Desc constructors.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; no data is being output or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input fields are stored in the _fields attribute within SortExpr instances, combined through _concat_expressions method. No external data flow or network transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic attribute handling and class inheritance but does not include obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. No insecure code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The classes define a simple, structured way to combine sorting expressions using logical operators. The use of UserDict allows flexible data handling. There are no input/output operations, network communications, or code execution features. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for managing sorting logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility for constructing sort expressions with standard Python features. No malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
