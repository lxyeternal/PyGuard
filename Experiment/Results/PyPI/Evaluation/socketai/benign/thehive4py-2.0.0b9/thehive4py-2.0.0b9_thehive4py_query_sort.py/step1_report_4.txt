{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for creating and combining sort expressions, likely for data querying or sorting operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to constructors (field: str) in Asc and Desc classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing identified; no network, file, or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object instantiation and are combined via overloaded operators, but no data leaves the system or affects external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code uses standard class and method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for sort expressions allowing combination via bitwise operators, with subclasses for ascending and descending sort directions. The implementation appears straightforward, focusing on constructing internal data structures (_fields). No external data sources or sinks are present. The only input is the field names provided as strings, which are stored internally. There are no network connections, code injections, or system modifications. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for building sort expressions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of sort expression classes with operator overloading. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The design is straightforward and safe.",
