  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the current package or module.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__ or __name__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source obtains version info and assigns it to __version__, no further data flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library to fetch package version information dynamically. It uses the current package or module name to determine which version to retrieve. There are no external data inputs, no data being sent elsewhere, and no suspicious code behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard for version retrieval in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation for obtaining package version info. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified.",
