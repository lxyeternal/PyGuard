  "purpose": "Retrieve the current package or module version using Python's standard library.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() called with __package__ or __name__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata.version() retrieves version info based on package/module name",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code employs a standard, well-understood pattern to obtain package version info, using importlib.metadata.version() with __package__ or __name__. It involves no external inputs, no data leaks, and no malicious or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's simplicity and reliance on standard library functions confirm its safety and correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard implementation for retrieving package version info, with no malicious activity or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
