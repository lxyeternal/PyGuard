  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package or module name using __package__ or __name__ and accesses its version via importlib.metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or security effects. The code only retrieves version info.",
  "flows": "The source (__package__ or __name__) is used to obtain version data through importlib.metadata.version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward use of importlib.metadata to fetch package version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata, then attempts to retrieve the version of the current package/module using importlib.metadata.version with __package__ or __name__. This is a standard, safe operation intended for package version retrieval. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe operation to get package version information. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
