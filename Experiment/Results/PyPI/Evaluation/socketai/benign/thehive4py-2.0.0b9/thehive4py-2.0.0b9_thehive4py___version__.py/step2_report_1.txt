  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward, standard pattern for retrieving package version info in Python. It uses `importlib.metadata.version()` with `__package__` or `__name__`. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and uses standard library functions without any suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code is safe and standard holds true.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, malware of 0, obfuscated of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is entirely safe; thus, risk scores above 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The assessments correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions.\n   - The analysis is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Code is straightforward and not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (No security risk present)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard implementation for retrieving package version info. It employs safe, well-understood Python library functions without any suspicious or malicious patterns. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate. No changes needed. The code poses no security threat.",
