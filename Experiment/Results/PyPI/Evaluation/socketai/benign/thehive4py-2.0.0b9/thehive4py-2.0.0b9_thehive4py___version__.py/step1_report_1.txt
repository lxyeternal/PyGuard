  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the current package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package or module name (__package__ or __name__) to obtain version info via importlib.metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or output data in a potentially harmful way.",
  "flows": "The source (__package__ or __name__) is used as input to importlib.metadata.version to get version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code straightforwardly retrieves package version without obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and assigns the package or module version to __version__ using importlib.metadata.version. It uses __package__ or __name__ to determine the target for version retrieval. The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, malicious data flows, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply retrieves the version of the current package or module in a standard way. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior based on this fragment.",
