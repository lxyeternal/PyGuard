  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses importlib.metadata to obtain the package or module version, which is a standard practice. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to common Python patterns for version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for accessing package version information and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
