  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\nThe provided code is a minimal, standard pattern for retrieving the version of the current package or module in Python. It uses the standard library `importlib.metadata` and relies on `__package__` or `__name__` to determine the target. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The logic is straightforward and well-understood in the Python ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly retrieves the package or module version without any issues.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Security risks:** No security risks identified.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, straightforward, and safe.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata.version()` with `__package__` or `__name__` is common practice.\n- No external inputs, no data flows to untrusted sinks, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or issues:\n- The scores seem consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final remarks:\n- The code is benign and poses no security threat.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and well-founded.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nBased on the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is a standard, safe pattern for retrieving package version info, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
