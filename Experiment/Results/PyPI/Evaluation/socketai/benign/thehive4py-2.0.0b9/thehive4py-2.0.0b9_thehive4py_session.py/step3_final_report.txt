{
  "purpose": "This code implements a secure, standard API client for TheHive, handling URL sanitization, retries, authentication, request construction, and response processing without any malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user credentials (username/password or API key), request parameters, and response content from the server.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the response processing functions where data is parsed, written to files, or used to raise exceptions; no untrusted data is directly executed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (credentials, request data) through request methods, with responses parsed or saved, without any suspicious or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present; code follows standard patterns and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client that uses standard libraries and practices. It handles credentials securely, sanitizes URLs, manages retries, processes responses safely, and raises detailed errors. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard implementation of an API client for TheHive. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
