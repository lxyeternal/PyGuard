  "review": "Let's systematically review each report and the associated code, considering the details provided.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code implements a custom `requests.Session` subclass for interacting with TheHive API.\n- It handles URL sanitization, retries, authentication (API key or username/password), request construction, response processing, and file download.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are detected.\n- The security risk scores are consistently low (~0.2), which aligns with the analysis.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Functionality matches the descriptions**: the code performs expected API client functions securely.\n- **No code anomalies or vulnerabilities** are evident from the code itself.\n- **Credentials handling** is appropriate, with no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Response processing** correctly distinguishes JSON and text responses.\n- **File download logic** is standard and safe.\n- **Error handling** raises detailed exceptions.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified**: The code appears well-structured, with proper practices. No logical or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware**: All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated**: All assign 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk**: Slightly above zero (~0.2), which is reasonable given the code's network operations, but no significant risks are present.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign such high scores; the highest is 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code does not contain obfuscation or malicious code.\n- No assumptions are made that are unsupported by the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (standard low risk for network operations, retries, and file handling)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, secure, and well-implemented API client for TheHive. It does not exhibit any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
