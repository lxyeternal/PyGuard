  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their findings, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \nProvides a custom session class for TheHive API, with request handling, retries, and response processing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original; no modifications or suspicious patterns are evident.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified, no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — low, considering it's a standard API client.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable given the thorough review.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe report is accurate; the code appears secure and legitimate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \nSimilar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client features, no suspicious activity, credentials handled securely, no obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Code correctness:** The code aligns with the original, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — consistent with a standard client.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nAccurate assessment; no issues found.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, a standard API client with no signs of malicious behavior, proper handling of credentials, retries, and response processing.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Code correctness:** Matches original code, no anomalies.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — reasonable.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nAssessment is accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \nDescribes a standard session class, emphasizing proper credential handling, retries, and response processing. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Code correctness:** Consistent with original code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nAccurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \nSimilar to others, standard API client, no suspicious behavior, proper handling, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Code correctness:** Matches original code.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — consistent.  \n\n**Verdict:**  \nAccurate.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Analysis:\n- All reports agree on the absence of malware, obfuscation, and suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured API client, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n## Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable given it's a network client handling credentials and data, but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n## My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
