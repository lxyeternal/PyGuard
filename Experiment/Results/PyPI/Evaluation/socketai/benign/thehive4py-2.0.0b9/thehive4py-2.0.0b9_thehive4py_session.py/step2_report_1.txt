  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential inconsistencies or overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard, secure implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. It highlights URL sanitization, retries, proper credential handling, and safe response processing.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code review. The code uses standard libraries, handles credentials securely, and no suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, secure handling, and absence of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious elements or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious behavior. It mentions secure credential handling, retries, and safe response processing.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No suspicious activity or code obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights proper management of credentials, retries, URL sanitization, and response handling. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence score aligns with the analysis. No issues found.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, confirming a legitimate, well-structured client with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident in the code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware=0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The assigned 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal inherent risk in such an API client.\n\n- **Confidence:** High confidence scores (0.9–0.95) are justified based on the thorough analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning and the code review.\n\n- **Potential for Adjustment:** No adjustments are necessary based on the current evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Security Risk:** 0.2 — reflects minimal inherent risk in API client code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
