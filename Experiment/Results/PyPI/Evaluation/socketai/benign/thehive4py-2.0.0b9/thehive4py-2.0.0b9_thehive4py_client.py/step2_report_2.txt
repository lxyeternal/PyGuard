  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the class as an API client for TheHive, with parameters for URL, API key, username/password, organization, verify, and retries.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Correctly notes data flows into session creation and header management. No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — no obfuscation observed.  \n  - *Security Risk:* 0 — no evident security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the class setup and header management.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — consistent.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - *Security Risk:* 0.1 — slightly above zero, perhaps due to the handling of headers or configuration, but still minimal.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.1 might be slightly conservative but acceptable given the context. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing proper credential handling and session management.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Scores:  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - *Security Risk:* 0 — aligns with benign code.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Focuses on credential management and header handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores:  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — correct.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - *Security Risk:* 0.2 — slightly higher, possibly due to handling of credentials or headers, but still low.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Similar to others, describing standard API client setup.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Scores:  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — consistent.  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - *Security Risk:* 0.1 — minimal.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), likely reflecting the handling of credentials and headers, but these are standard practices and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting typical configuration and session management practices.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
