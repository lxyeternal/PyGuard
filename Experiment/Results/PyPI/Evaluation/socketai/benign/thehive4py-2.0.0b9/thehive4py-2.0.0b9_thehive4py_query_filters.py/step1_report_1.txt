{
  "purpose": "Define a set of filter classes for constructing query/filter expressions, likely for data querying or filtering within an application.",
  "sources": "No external input reading detected within this code; the code relies on input parameters for class instantiations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs observed; the code only constructs filter objects and raises errors on type mismatch.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of filter objects with parameters (e.g., field names, values), combined using logical operators (&, |, ~), but no external data flow or untrusted input flow present within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn for deprecation notice; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors or hardcoded secrets. The code structure is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of filter classes that build filter expressions as nested dictionaries. Operator overloading allows combining filters logically, but there is no external input processing or system interaction. The only notable behavior is a deprecation warning in the Contains class, which does not introduce any security risk. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a clean, purpose-built filter expression builder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filter class implementation without malicious intent or security issues. It constructs filter expressions and supports logical combination. No external data handling or risky operations are present.",
