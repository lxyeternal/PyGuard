{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of filter classes for building query expressions, supporting logical operations like AND, OR, NOT.",
  "sources": "User input or external data could be used when instantiating filter objects with specific field names and values.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if filter objects are used to generate database queries or other commands, they could influence query logic. No explicit dangerous sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (field names and values) flows into filter objects, which can be combined using logical operators into complex expressions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings for deprecated features; no suspicious code like code injection, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The code relies on standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a set of filter classes inheriting from _UserDict, enabling logical composition (AND, OR, NOT) of filter conditions. No external data is processed directly; the filter objects store query parameters as dictionaries. The methods for combining filters create new filter instances with combined conditions. Use of warnings for deprecated 'Contains' class suggests awareness of API evolution, not malicious intent. No input/output, file operations, network calls, or execution of untrusted code are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of filter classes for query building, with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and standard in design, with no suspicious anomalies detected.",
