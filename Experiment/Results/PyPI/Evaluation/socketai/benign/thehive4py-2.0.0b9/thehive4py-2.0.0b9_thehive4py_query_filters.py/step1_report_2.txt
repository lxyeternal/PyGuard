  "purpose": "Defines a set of filter classes for constructing complex query expressions using logical operators and field comparisons.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and methods for creating filter objects. No input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is focused on data structure creation without executing data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn in the Contains class for deprecation notice is normal; no suspicious code is detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several filter classes inheriting from _FilterBase, enabling logical composition with operators & (and), | (or), and ~ (not). The classes encapsulate comparison operators for filtering data based on field values, such as less than, greater than, equal, between, in-list, and string matching. The code employs standard Python idioms, with no external data input, no code execution, or network interactions. The presence of warnings for deprecated features is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code appears to be a secure, straightforward implementation of filter classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, well-structured set of filter classes used for building query expressions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
