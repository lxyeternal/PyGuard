  "purpose": "Defines a set of filter classes for constructing query expressions with logical and comparison operators.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__ methods), operator overload methods (__and__, __or__, __invert__), and warnings.warn calls.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or performs critical security operations directly. No data output or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of filter objects -> use of logical operators (__and__, __or__, __invert__) -> creation of filter expressions.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external inputs handled insecurely.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to build filter expressions with various comparison classes. It employs operator overloading to allow intuitive combination of filters. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, and no unsafe code constructs. The warnings.warn call warns about deprecation but is not malicious. The code appears to be a standard filter expression builder without malicious intent or harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless filter expression utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It includes a deprecation warning but nothing malicious. Overall, it's safe and not obfuscated.",
