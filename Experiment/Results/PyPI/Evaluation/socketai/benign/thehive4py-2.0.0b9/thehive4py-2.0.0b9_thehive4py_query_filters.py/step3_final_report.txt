  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of filter classes for constructing query/filter expressions using operator overloading, with no external data input or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of filter objects with parameters; operator overloads (__and__, __or__, __invert__) that combine filter instances.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or output to external systems directly.",
  "flows": "Creation of filter objects from parameters, combined via logical operators to form nested filter dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a deprecation warning in the Contains class; no other unusual code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs filter expressions as nested dictionaries, with operator overloading for logical combinations. No external input reading, data sinks, or malicious code detected. The deprecation warning in Contains is benign. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The potential for downstream misuse exists but is outside the scope of this code. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured filter expression builder with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal risk score of 0.1 is justified, primarily considering potential downstream misuse, but the code itself is safe.",
