  "purpose": "Utility functions to convert between datetime objects and timestamps in milliseconds, specifically formatted for TheHive platform.",
  "sources": "time.time() for current timestamp, datetime.timestamp() for datetime object, and timestamp input for conversion to datetime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; functions only process and return data without external interaction.",
  "flows": "Input from time.time(), datetime.timestamp(), and external timestamp parameter flow through conversion functions without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for timestamp conversions. It uses standard Python libraries with no external data sources or sinks involved. No suspicious logic, hidden code, or potentially malicious behavior is present. The functions rely on standard time and datetime modules to perform conversions, which are safe and common practices. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for timestamp conversions with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It performs simple, well-understood operations with standard libraries.",
