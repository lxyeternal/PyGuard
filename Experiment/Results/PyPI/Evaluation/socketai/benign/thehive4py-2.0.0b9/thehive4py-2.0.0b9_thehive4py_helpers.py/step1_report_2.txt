  "sources": "time.time(), datetime.timestamp(), input parameters (datetime, timestamp, tz).",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing timestamps, conversions; no data output or external data writes.",
  "flows": "Input time data (current time, datetime object, timestamp) → conversions and return of timestamp values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. Code uses standard library functions and straightforward conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions for converting between datetime objects and millisecond timestamps used by TheHive. It uses standard Python libraries 'time' and 'datetime' with no external inputs or network activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs. No suspicious data flows or potential malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple utility functions for timestamp conversions with no malicious intent or security issues.",
