  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "time.time() and datetime.timestamp() provide source data, which is processed locally into integer timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or unusual language features. All functions are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple helper functions for timestamp conversions, utilizing standard Python libraries. No external data inputs, no use of untrusted sources, no data leaks, nor any suspicious logic or behaviors are present. The functions perform local computations without side effects or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility functions with no malicious intent. It poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
