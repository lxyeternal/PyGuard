  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between datetime objects and millisecond timestamps.",
  "sources": "Standard Python libraries: time and datetime modules for current time and timestamp conversions.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Functions convert current time or datetime objects to timestamps and vice versa, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions using standard libraries, performing local conversions without external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The functions are deterministic, simple, and free of obfuscation or external data handling. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward implementation. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified, and no further action is necessary.",
