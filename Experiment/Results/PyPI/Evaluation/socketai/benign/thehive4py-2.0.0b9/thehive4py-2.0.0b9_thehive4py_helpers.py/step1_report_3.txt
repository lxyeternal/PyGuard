  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting datetime objects to timestamps and vice versa, specifically formatted for TheHive platform.",
  "sources": "time module for current timestamp; datetime object input for conversions",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or transmitted, no user input is processed",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow exists; data flows from system time functions and input parameters to return values without external influence",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple timestamp conversion utilities: obtaining current time in milliseconds, converting datetime objects to milliseconds since epoch, and converting timestamps back to datetime with optional timezone support. All functions rely on standard library modules and do not process external user input or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for timestamp handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely with standard libraries and performs basic conversions without external data transmission.",
