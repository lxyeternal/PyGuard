  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward timestamp conversions with no obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple utility functions to convert between datetime objects and timestamps used by TheHive. It uses standard library functions (time.time(), datetime.timestamp(), datetime.fromtimestamp()) without any dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is well-structured, clear, and implements basic, safe operations for timestamp handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic timestamp conversions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard utility module with no anomalies or malware indications.",
