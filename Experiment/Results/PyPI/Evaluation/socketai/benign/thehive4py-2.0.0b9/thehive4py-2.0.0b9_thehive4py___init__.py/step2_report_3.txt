  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code imports a dependency (`thehive4py.client`) but does not utilize it within the provided fragment.\n- It defines a function `_warn_old_py_version()` that checks the current Python version (`sys.version_info`) against a minimum threshold (default `(3, 9)`).\n- If the Python version is below the threshold, it issues a `DeprecationWarning` advising users to upgrade.\n- The function is called immediately upon import, performing the check at runtime.\n- The code uses standard modules (`sys`, `warnings`) and practices, with no obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n- **External network activity:** None.\n- **Data leaks or sensitive data handling:** None.\n- **Suspicious logic or assumptions:** None; the code performs a straightforward environment check and user notification.\n\n### Review of the scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues or concerns:\n- The code imports `thehive4py.client` but does not use it. This could be seen as unnecessary or potentially a sign of incomplete code, but it is not malicious or risky.\n- The purpose is solely to warn about Python version support, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their conclusions.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n- The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard environment check and user notification, with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, performs a simple version check, and issues a warning if needed. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The scoring should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
