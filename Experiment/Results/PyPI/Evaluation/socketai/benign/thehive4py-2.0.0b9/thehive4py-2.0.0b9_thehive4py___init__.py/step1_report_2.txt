  "purpose": "Check Python version compatibility and issue warnings if the Python version is below a specified minimum.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, warnings.warn",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn (potentially alerting user or developer about deprecated Python versions)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> _warn_old_py_version() -> warnings.warn",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of version check and warnings is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from an open-source library (thehive4py), defines a function to warn users if their Python version is below 3.9, and calls that function. It uses standard modules (sys and warnings) appropriately, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The logic is straightforward and aimed at informing users about deprecated Python versions. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check and warning mechanism without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and intended to maintain compatibility with future Python versions.",
