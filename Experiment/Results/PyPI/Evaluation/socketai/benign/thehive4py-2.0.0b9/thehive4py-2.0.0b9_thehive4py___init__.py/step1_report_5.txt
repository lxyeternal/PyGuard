{
  "purpose": "To warn users if their Python version is below 3.9, indicating that the package may not support older Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads the current Python version), warnings.warn (displays a deprecation warning).",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn (potentially outputs warning message to stderr).",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked against min_py_version; if less, warnings.warn is triggered to inform the user.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard modules and functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a third-party library, which is harmless. It defines a function to check the Python version and issue a warning if the version is below 3.9. The function is immediately invoked. All operations are standard and do not perform any malicious activities. There are no hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version check and warning mechanism to inform users about support status. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
