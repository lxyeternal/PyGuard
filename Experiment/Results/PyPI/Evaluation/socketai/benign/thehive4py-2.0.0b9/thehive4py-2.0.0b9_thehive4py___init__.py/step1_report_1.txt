  "purpose": "Check Python version compatibility and warn users if their Python version is too old for thehive4py library.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version; warnings.warn for issuing warnings",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn could notify the user, but does not perform malicious actions",
  "flows": "Code reads system Python version, then issues a warning if version is below threshold",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; standard version check and warning mechanism",
  "analysis": "The code imports thehive4py.client to indicate dependency context. It defines a function to check the current Python version against a minimum. If the version is too old, it issues a deprecation warning advising an upgrade. The function is called immediately, executing the check at import time. No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. No external network activity or sensitive data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard environment check and user notification about Python version support. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
