  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code fragment: a version check using `sys.version_info` and issuing a warning via `warnings.warn` if the Python version is below 3.9.\n- The code imports `thehive4py.client`, but the imported class is not used in the provided snippet.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no external network activity, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code performs a benign environment check and user notification.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present.\n- The code is standard and safe.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or security flaws are present.\n- The only minor point is that importing `thehive4py.client` is unnecessary in this fragment since it's not used; however, this is not a security concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume that a version check and warning are benign, which is correct.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The purpose and analysis descriptions align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe environment check with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No modifications needed.",
