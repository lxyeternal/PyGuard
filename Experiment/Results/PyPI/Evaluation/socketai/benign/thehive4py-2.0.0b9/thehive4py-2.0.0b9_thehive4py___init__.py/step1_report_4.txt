  "purpose": "Check Python version compatibility and issue a warning if the version is below 3.9.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for checking Python version, warnings.warn for issuing warnings",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn could alert the user but does not influence system state or data leakage",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → if condition → warnings.warn",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard version check and warning issuance",
  "analysis": "The code imports TheHiveApi from thehive4py.client but does not utilize it in the provided fragment. It defines a function to warn about outdated Python versions, which is a typical compatibility check. The function checks the current Python version and issues a DeprecationWarning if below 3.9. The warning message is clear and informative. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No unsafe operations, external data flows, or obfuscated code are detected. The code serves a benign purpose of user notification regarding Python version support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version check and warning mechanism with no malicious intent or security risks.",
