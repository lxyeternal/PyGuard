{
  "purpose": "The code checks the Python version and warns the user if it is below a specified minimum version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to read Python version; warnings.warn to generate a warning message.",
  "falls": "No untrusted input sources; the code only reads environment information and issues warnings.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info (source) to conditional check, then to warnings.warn (sink) if condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The code appears straightforward and intended for deprecation warning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific client library (thehive4py.client) but does not use it in this fragment. It defines a function to check Python version and issue a warning if the version is too old. The warning message suggests upcoming support drops for older Python versions. The function is immediately invoked. No data is transmitted over the network, no backdoors or malicious code present, and no suspicious obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to warn users about outdated Python versions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is a benign version check and warning mechanism.",
