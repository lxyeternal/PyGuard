  "purpose": "Check Python environment version and issue a deprecation warning if below 3.9.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for current Python version",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn to issue a warning message",
  "flows": "sys.version_info read -> comparison -> warnings.warn if below threshold",
  "anomalies": "None; standard version check and warning",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'thehive4py.client' but does not use it, which is harmless. It defines a function that compares the current Python version to a minimum and issues a DeprecationWarning if outdated. The logic is straightforward, uses standard modules, and performs no malicious or obfuscated actions. No external network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is solely to inform users about deprecated Python versions, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment check with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
