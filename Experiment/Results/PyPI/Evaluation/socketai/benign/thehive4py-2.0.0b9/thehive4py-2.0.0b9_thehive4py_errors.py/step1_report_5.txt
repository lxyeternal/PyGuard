{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling in the thehive4py library, encapsulating an error message and optional HTTP response data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and method parameters; no external data inputs are explicitly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only defines a class and a constructor without data processing or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class inheriting from Exception. It initializes with a message and an optional Response object, storing these as instance attributes. There are no external input sources, no data processing, and no output or network operations. The code appears standard and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard exception encapsulation without external data processing or unsafe operations.",
