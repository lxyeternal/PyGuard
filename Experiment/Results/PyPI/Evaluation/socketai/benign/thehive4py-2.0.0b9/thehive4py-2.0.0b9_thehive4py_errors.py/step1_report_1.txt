{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to TheHive API interactions, specifically capturing error messages and optional HTTP response data.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a class and imports modules but does not read external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs, external calls, or data leaks within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is solely class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears straightforward and standard for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'Response' class from 'requests' to potentially include HTTP response details in exceptions. It defines a subclass of Exception, adding attributes for message and response, with appropriate initialization. The implementation is conventional, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No external data input or harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class definition for error handling in API interactions with TheHive. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks.",
