  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with no external data processing, network calls, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - The code imports `Response` from `requests`, but does not perform any network operations or data leaks.\n   - There is no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malware.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis; no security risk is present.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern could be if the class were used maliciously elsewhere, but based solely on this code snippet, that is not the case.\n   - The code's purpose is clear and standard, with no hidden behaviors.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The consistent assessment across all reports supports that the code is benign.\n   - No modifications are necessary; the scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Current Score | Justification                                               | Recommended Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware          | 0               | No malicious code or behavior present                        | 0                 |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               | No obfuscation or hidden code present                        | 0                 |\n| Security Risk    | 0               | No security vulnerabilities or risky operations identified | 0                 |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe exception class.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
