  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to TheHive API interactions.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python class definition for a custom exception. It extends the built-in Exception class and adds optional response handling. There are no input reading, no external data processing, and no dangerous operations such as network access, code execution, or data leaks. The class is well-structured and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves purely as an error container with no side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
