  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to TheHive API interactions.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a class and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is being processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining an exception class with optional response handling. No unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Response' from 'requests' and defines an exception class 'TheHiveError' with an initializer that accepts a message and an optional Response object. It documents the purpose and arguments. There are no inputs from external sources or data outputs, and no data processing occurs. The class is used for error handling, and the code appears clean and standard for such use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign definition of a custom exception class for error handling related to TheHive API. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security issues detected.",
