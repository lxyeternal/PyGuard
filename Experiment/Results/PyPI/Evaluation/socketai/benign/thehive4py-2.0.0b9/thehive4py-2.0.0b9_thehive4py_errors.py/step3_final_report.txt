{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'TheHiveError' that encapsulates an error message and an optional HTTP response object for error handling in thehive4py.",
  "sources": "The class reads the 'message' parameter and optionally the 'response' object from the 'requests' library during initialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects; the code only stores parameters as attributes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'message' and 'response' flow into object attributes; no further data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with an optional Response attribute, importing only standard modules. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or contain malicious code. The class is well-documented, and its implementation is typical for error handling. No external data reading beyond parameter assignment occurs, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code's safety. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
