  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, importing 'Response' from 'requests' and adding attributes for message and response.  \n   - No external data, user input, or network operations are involved.  \n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.  \n   **Conclusion:** The code matches the description and contains no issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**  \n   - The reports uniformly describe the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.  \n   - They correctly identify that the class is a simple exception container.  \n   - No logical errors or flaws are present in the analysis.  \n   **Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is sound and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or contain any malicious payloads.  \n   - The class is a standard exception class with no security implications.  \n   **Conclusion:** No justification exists for higher risk scores; 0 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.  \n   - The code is purely a class definition with no harmful behavior.  \n   **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities or malicious intent are inferred.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; all are zero where appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \n- The code is a standard, safe exception class.  \n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.  \n- No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThis code is a typical, harmless exception class definition with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
