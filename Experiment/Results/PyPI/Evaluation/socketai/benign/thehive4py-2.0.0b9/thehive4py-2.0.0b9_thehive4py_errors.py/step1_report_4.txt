  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to TheHive API interactions.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard class definition and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and requests.Response, then defines a custom exception class 'TheHiveError' with an initializer that accepts a message and an optional Response object. The class extends Exception and stores the message and response as instance variables. No user input, network operations, or external data handling is present. The code appears to be a typical, straightforward exception class without malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless custom exception class used for error handling in a Python application interfacing with TheHive. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
