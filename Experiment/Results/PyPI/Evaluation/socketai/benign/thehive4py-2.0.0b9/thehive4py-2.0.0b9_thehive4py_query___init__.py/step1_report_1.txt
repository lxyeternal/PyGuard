{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define type aliases and import statements for a query construction library, likely used to build database or API queries with filters, sorting, and pagination.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.filters, .page, .sort); variable assignment for QueryExpr.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No dynamic execution or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various filter, sort, and pagination classes and functions, and defines a type alias 'QueryExpr' as a list of unions of these types and dictionaries. There is no executable logic, data handling, or user input processing in this snippet. It functions solely as type hinting and import organization. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard import and type alias patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of import statements and a type alias for query expressions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is a benign component of a larger query-building system.",
