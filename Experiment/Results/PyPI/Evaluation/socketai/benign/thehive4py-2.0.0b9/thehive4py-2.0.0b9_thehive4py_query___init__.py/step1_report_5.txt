{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and imports related to filtering, sorting, and pagination for a data querying system.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.filters, .page, .sort) and type alias assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; no input/output operations or data handling are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code is primarily import statements and type alias definitions, with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be straightforward module imports and type aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several filter, sort, and pagination classes from internal modules, and defines a type alias 'QueryExpr' that is a list containing filter expressions, sort expressions, pagination objects, or dictionaries. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime behaviors. The code serves as a type annotation and import setup, which is common in modular Python projects. No malicious or suspicious patterns are observed, and the structure indicates standard code organization for a query builder or similar system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup for a data querying framework, involving imports and type alias definitions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The purpose appears to be to facilitate type checking and modular design.",
