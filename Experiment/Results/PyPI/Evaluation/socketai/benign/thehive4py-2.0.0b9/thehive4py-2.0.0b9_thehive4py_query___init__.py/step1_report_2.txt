{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and imports for a filtering and sorting system, likely used for querying data collections or databases.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .filters, .page, and .sort; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is purely type alias and import declarations without runtime data flow or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a type hinting or interface layer.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several filter, sort, and pagination classes and functions, then creates a type alias 'QueryExpr' that is a list containing various filter, sort, pagination objects, or dictionaries. There are no data processing, execution, or external interactions. The code is typical for setting up query interfaces and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple setup for a query expression system, involving no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be a harmless part of a larger data querying library.",
