{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and imports related to filtering, sorting, and pagination for query expressions, likely part of a database or data querying library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .filters, .page, .sort",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily establishes type aliases and imports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns; straightforward import statements and type aliasing",
  "analysis": "The code imports several filter, sort, and pagination classes and functions, then defines a type alias 'QueryExpr' as a list of union types including filter expressions, sort expressions, pagination objects, and dictionaries. The code is structural and does not perform any data processing or external interactions. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data sinks, and no data flow indicating potential malicious activity. The code appears to be part of a larger querying framework, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a query expression framework, involving type definitions and imports without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
