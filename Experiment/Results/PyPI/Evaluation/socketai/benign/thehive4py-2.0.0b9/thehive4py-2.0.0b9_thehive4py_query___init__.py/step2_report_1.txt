  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely composed of import statements and a type alias definition (`QueryExpr`).\n- No data processing, input/output handling, or runtime logic is present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup for a query-building library, with no signs of security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Specific Analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet is straightforward, with no executable logic, no data flow, and no external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n   - The import statements and type alias are standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code contains no executable logic, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate because there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code is purely structural and intended for type hinting, which is standard practice.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No overestimations of risk or malware are present.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis and the code's nature.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n**Final Personal Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard component of a query-building library, with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores reflect the code's nature appropriately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n- The overall security posture based on this snippet is very low risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
