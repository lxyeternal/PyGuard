  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely composed of import statements and a type alias definition.\n- No data processing, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard part of a query-building library, serving as a type alias and import organization.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the original exactly; no issues or discrepancies are observed.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify higher scores, and the code's content does not warrant such.\n   - The code is purely structural, with no runtime behavior or external interactions.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code's role as a type alias and import setup.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No inconsistencies are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippet is a standard, safe, and non-malicious component of a query-building library. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring reflects that accurately.",
