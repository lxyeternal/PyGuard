  "purpose": "Type alias definition for query expressions used in a query-building library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.filters, .page, .sort).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and type alias definition with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a type alias 'QueryExpr' as a list of unions of filter, sort, pagination classes, and dictionaries. There is no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code serves as a structural component for type hinting within a larger query system. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code. The reports correctly interpret the code as a standard, safe part of a query-building framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores reflect the code's harmless nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
