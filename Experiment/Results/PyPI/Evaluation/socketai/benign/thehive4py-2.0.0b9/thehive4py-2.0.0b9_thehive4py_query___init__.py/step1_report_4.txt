{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type aliases and import statements for a query-building system involving filters, sorting, and pagination.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes, and the assignment of a type alias for QueryExpr.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; the code primarily sets up type annotations and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code is declarative and does not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various filter, sort, and pagination classes, and defines a type alias for query expressions involving these components. The structure is standard for a query abstraction layer, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious constructs. All elements are typical for a library intended to build database queries or similar operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of imports and type aliasing for a query framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and standard in design.",
