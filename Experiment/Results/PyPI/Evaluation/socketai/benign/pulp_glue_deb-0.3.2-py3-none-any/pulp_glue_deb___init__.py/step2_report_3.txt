  "review": "Let's systematically analyze these reports and the underlying code:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Hidden Code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input/output operations, no external calls, and no suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and typical for Python package version declarations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior. No logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Issues:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity. These scores seem appropriate and reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external interactions or complex logic, there's no justification for a higher risk score. The code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code snippet is a standard version declaration and is not malicious.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
