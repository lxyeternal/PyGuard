  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no input/output, external calls, or complex logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, with scores reflecting no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
