  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - All reports describe a straightforward assignment of the string `\"0.3.2\"` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - The original code snippet is: `__version__ = \"0.3.2\"`.\n   - There are no additional lines, inputs, outputs, or external calls.\n   - This is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as minimal, benign, and typical for version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, which is reasonable for such straightforward code.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Risks**:\n   - Since the code is only a variable assignment, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The malware score should remain 0.\n   - The risk score should also be 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or security concerns.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they only state facts based on the code snippet.\n   - No unwarranted speculation about malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- The overall security risk is **0**.\n\n**My Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
