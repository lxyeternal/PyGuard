  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a minimal, typical version declaration.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - **Note:** Since the code is trivial, the reports are appropriately cautious and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1.0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the analysis.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no security risk, and no obfuscation, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is a standard version string assignment, which is inherently safe.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports agree there is no malware activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score should be 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n   - The absence of suspicious features supports the conclusion of benignity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Security Risk Score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard declaration of a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll evidence points to this being a benign, typical version assignment in a Python package. No further action or concern is warranted.",
