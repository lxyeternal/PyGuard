  "purpose": "This module provides a Python wrapper class 'Transformer' for chaining audio effects to process audio files or arrays using the SoX library.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from input files specified by paths or from numpy arrays provided as input_array. Effects and global arguments are set via methods that modify internal state.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow through effect arguments (e.g., parameters to effects) which are passed as command-line arguments to SoX; outputs include processed audio files or arrays, but no direct data leakage or external communication occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (file paths or numpy arrays) into the effects chain; effects are added via methods, then build or build_array constructs command-line arguments for SoX, which processes data accordingly. The effects parameters may incorporate user-supplied values, but are incorporated into command args rather than executed as code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution (like eval or exec) is used. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. Logging is only informational; no network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The noiseprof and noisered methods invoke file operations, but these are standard for noise profiling and do not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive audio processing class that constructs command-line arguments for SoX based on user methods. All data inputs (file paths, arrays) are validated, and effect parameters are incorporated into the argument list. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data theft. The methods operate solely within the context of preparing and executing SoX commands. Effect parameters are derived from method arguments, which are validated, and are not used in a malicious way. Logging is limited to info-level logs about file creation. No suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured audio effects wrapper around SoX, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only constructs and executes system commands for audio processing, with thorough validation of user inputs. No evidence of malware or security risks is present.",
