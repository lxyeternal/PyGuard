  "purpose": "The code provides functions for extracting metadata and statistics from audio files using SoX, such as bit depth, bitrate, channels, comments, duration, encoding, file type, number of samples, sample rate, silence detection, validation, and overall info and stats summaries.",
  "sources": "Input file paths provided to functions such as 'bitdepth', 'bitrate', 'channels', 'comments', 'duration', 'encoding', 'file_type', 'num_samples', 'sample_rate', 'silent', 'info', 'stat', 'validate_input_file', 'validate_input_file_list', 'validate_output_file', 'file_extension'. These are typically user-supplied or function-invoked file paths.",
  "sinks": "Functions executing 'soxi' and 'sox' commands to retrieve audio metadata. The 'soxi' function is a wrapper around these system calls, which process the provided file paths and output metadata. The 'validate_input_file' and 'validate_output_file' functions perform file existence and permission checks, potentially leading to exceptions or warnings if conditions are not met.",
  "flows": "Input paths are validated by 'validate_input_file'. Metadata functions invoke 'soxi' with specific format characters to obtain data. 'info' and 'stat' functions collect multiple metadata points by calling respective functions. Validation functions may raise errors or warnings before processing. No external network communication or suspicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'soxi' and 'sox' commands depends on external tools; no code executes external scripts or untrusted commands beyond system calls. Validation functions perform standard file existence and permission checks. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation evident. The silent detection uses 'stat' output; the check 'if mean_norm is not float('nan')' is somewhat unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive interface for extracting audio file metadata via SoX utilities. It performs validation of file paths and extensions, manages potential file access issues, and parses output from external commands. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The functions execute system commands in a controlled manner, with standard validation. The silent detection method and warning logs are normal for such tools. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for audio metadata extraction, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It mainly wraps external command-line tools for safe use within a Python context. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
