{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to extract metadata and statistics from audio files using SoX and Soxi commands.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths from function parameters, accesses file existence via os.path and Path, calls external soxi and sox commands.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present. Functions mainly process output from external commands and log warnings.",
  "flows": "File paths are validated, then passed to soxi commands; output is parsed and returned. No untrusted input is directly sent over network or used in unsafe commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code relies on external commands and standard libraries. No obfuscated code present. No suspicious or malicious logic is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward metadata extraction from audio files via SoX commands. It validates file existence and format, parses command outputs, and returns structured data. No suspicious network activity, hidden commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of external commands appears safe and intended. Warnings are logged for unavailable data or file issues but do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be standard audio metadata processing without malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate audio metadata utility with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It performs expected file validation, invokes external tools for data extraction, and handles outputs securely. No malicious or sabotage indicators identified.",
