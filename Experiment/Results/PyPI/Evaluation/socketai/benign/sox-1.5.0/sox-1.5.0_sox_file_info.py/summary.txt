  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for extracting audio file metadata using external commands. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
