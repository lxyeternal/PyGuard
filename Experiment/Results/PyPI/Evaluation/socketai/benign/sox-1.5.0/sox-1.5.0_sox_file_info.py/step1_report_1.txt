{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to extract audio file metadata and statistics using the sox utility, including validation and utility functions for handling audio files.",
  "sources": "Input file paths provided as parameters to functions; reading file existence, extension, and soxi output commands.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data leading to security effects; the code does not write or execute untrusted data directly, nor does it perform network communication or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Validation functions check input paths, then soxi commands extract metadata. Metadata is parsed and returned without executing untrusted code or data injection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code uses standard library functions and calls to sox for metadata extraction. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input file paths for existence and format, then calls external 'soxi' commands to extract metadata. It parses output strings into usable data, with proper error handling. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data exfiltration code is present. Validation functions prevent processing invalid files. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. The functions focus solely on metadata extraction and validation, which are standard operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard metadata extraction utility for audio files using sox, with thorough validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It is a benign, well-structured utility code for file info extraction.",
