{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for extracting audio file metadata using the sox and soxi commands, including validation and info parsing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input file paths, particularly in functions like validate_input_file, validate_input_file_list, and stat; it also reads file extensions and headers via soxi calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input directly for dangerous actions; the code mainly calls external commands and logs information.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are validated, then used to invoke soxi commands to extract metadata; no untrusted data flows into dangerous system calls or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious dynamic execution. There are no hardcoded credentials or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically validates file existence and formats before calling external sox commands to gather metadata. It logs warnings for unavailable data but does not process untrusted data in a way that could cause harm. The functions primarily handle file paths, perform checks, and parse command outputs, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for audio file metadata extraction. It follows safe practices like input validation and error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
