{
  "purpose": "This script is a configuration file for building project documentation using Sphinx. It sets up various settings for the documentation build process.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the dynamic import of version.py via SourceFileLoader.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data output or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the only dynamic code executes a local file to load version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of SourceFileLoader to dynamically load a module from a relative path is unusual but not malicious; no secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard Sphinx configuration with imports, settings, and file paths. The only dynamic operation is loading version info via SourceFileLoader, which is a legitimate technique to load project version details. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code is detected. The code is well-structured and follows standard configuration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign Sphinx configuration file for documentation generation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The use of dynamic module loading is legitimate in this context and not indicative of malicious intent.",
