  "purpose": "A Python wrapper around the SoX command-line utility for audio processing, performing file combination, format setting, and previewing with thorough input validation.",
  "sources": "File paths, input format parameters, volume lists, and effect parameters used to construct command-line arguments for external SoX and play commands.",
  "sinks": "Constructed command-line arguments passed to external processes; no untrusted data sinks identified within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then used to build argument lists which are passed to external commands via subprocess calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. Input validation is comprehensive.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on file paths, formats, sample rates, channels, encoding, and volumes. It constructs command-line arguments for SoX and play, then executes them via external calls. No malicious routines, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. External command execution is controlled and validated, minimizing risks. The scores reflect the benign nature, with a low security risk due to external process invocation but mitigated by validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured, and secure wrapper for the SoX utility. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk score is appropriate given the thorough input validation and controlled external command execution.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
