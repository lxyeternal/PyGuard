  "purpose": "The code provides static version information variables for a Python project.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static variable assignments within the script.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external interactions or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version info snippet with a shebang line, containing only variable assignments. It lacks inputs, outputs, external dependencies, or dynamic behavior. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration snippet with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
