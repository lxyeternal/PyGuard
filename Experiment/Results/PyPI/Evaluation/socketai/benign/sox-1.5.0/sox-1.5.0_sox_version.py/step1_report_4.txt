  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line, a docstring, and two string assignments defining version information. There are no inputs, outputs, or logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. The code appears to be a simple version declaration segment common in Python scripts or modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving only to define version variables with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
