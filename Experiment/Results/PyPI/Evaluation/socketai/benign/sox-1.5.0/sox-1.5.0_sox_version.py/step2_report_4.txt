  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely declarative, setting static version strings.\n   - No inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behavior are present.\n   - The code contains only a shebang line and two variable assignments, which are standard for version info snippets.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports agree there is no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Security Risks:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity, there are no evident security risks, which is correctly reflected by the securityRisk score of 0.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Potential Issues or Points of Concern:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments, there are no discrepancies to challenge.\n- The code is a standard version declaration snippet, typical and harmless.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed; the code is safe.\n- For completeness, ensure that in the context of a larger project, this version info is not dynamically generated or injected from untrusted sources, but as-is, it is safe.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and poses no security risk. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
