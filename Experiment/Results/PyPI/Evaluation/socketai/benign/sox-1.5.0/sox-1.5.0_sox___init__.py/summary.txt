  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system utility check with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The only concern is the outdated method of executing system commands, which can be improved but does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to outdated practices but no actual vulnerabilities."
