  "purpose": "Check for the presence of the SoX utility by executing 'sox -h' and log a warning if not found.",
  "sources": "Execution of 'sox -h' via os.popen() to determine if SoX is installed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Command output from 'sox -h' read into the program to assess presence; no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() instead of subprocess, which is outdated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple system check for SoX installation by executing a static command. It reads the output to determine if SoX is available and logs a warning if not. No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of os.popen() is deprecated but does not introduce security issues in this context. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system utility check with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The only concern is the outdated method of executing system commands, which can be improved but does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to outdated practices but no actual vulnerabilities.",
