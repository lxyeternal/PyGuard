  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for an audio processing library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores (close to 1) are justified, but the overall security risk is minimal. The malware and obfuscated scores should be set to 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively adjusted to around 0.1 to reflect the benign testing nature."
