There are no signs of malicious code, external data fetching, or data leaks. No suspicious code anomalies, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. Usage of dependencies and package data appear normal and related to package packaging only.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and safe. It contains standard packaging code without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No malware or security risks identified.",
