  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'sox' library, defining metadata, dependencies, and optional requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies specified in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with explicit dependencies and package data. It reads a markdown file for description and calls setup() with package info. No dynamic code, external data fetching, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. All dependencies are standard, and no secrets or network activity are evident. The script is static and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious or suspicious features. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
