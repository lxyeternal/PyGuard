  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sox' Python package, primarily for installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; user input not explicitly handled; dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no untrusted data output or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow paths detected; dependencies and metadata are standard.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional extras. No external data input, environment variables, or network interactions are involved. No anomalies or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
