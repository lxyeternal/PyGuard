{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface for calling SoX and related tools to process audio files, retrieve information, and play audio streams.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as 'args', 'src_array', and 'filepath'. No external untrusted sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Data output occurs via subprocess communication (stdout and stderr), and some functions return strings or numpy arrays. No untrusted data is directly written to files or network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to subprocess commands; output is captured and returned. No external untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code properly handles subprocess calls with exception handling. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of utility functions wrapping SoX command-line tools for audio processing. It performs subprocess calls with proper error handling and input validation. The subprocess calls are standard and do not include untrusted data manipulation beyond command parameters, which are controlled. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The module is designed for legitimate audio processing purposes with proper error handling and input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard audio processing wrapper around SoX with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages subprocess calls and input validation, with no suspicious or malicious constructs detected.",
