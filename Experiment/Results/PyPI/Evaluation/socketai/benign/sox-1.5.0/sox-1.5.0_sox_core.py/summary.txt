  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward wrapper around SoX and related tools, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring that inputs passed to subprocess are sanitized or validated to prevent command injection. Given the current validation and typical usage, the code is safe with a low to moderate security risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk around 0.2 are justified and appropriate."
