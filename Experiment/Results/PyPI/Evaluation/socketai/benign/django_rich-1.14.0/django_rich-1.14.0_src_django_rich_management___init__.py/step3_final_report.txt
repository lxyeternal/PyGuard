  "purpose": "Configure a styled console output for a Django management command, managing color options and output streams.",
  "sources": "Options 'force_color', 'no_color', and 'stdout' provided to the command; sys.stdout as default output stream.",
  "sinks": "The console output via the 'rich' library's Console object, writing to the specified output stream.",
  "flows": "Options are validated for conflicts, then used to set 'force_terminal' in console creation; console outputs styled text to the stream.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; straightforward configuration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Django command configuring a rich console. It validates options to prevent conflicts, then creates a Console object with safe parameters. No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'rich' is standard, and the code is clear and well-structured. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and free of malicious or security risks. It functions as intended for console styling without any suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
