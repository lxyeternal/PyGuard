  "purpose": "This code provides custom test result classes and a test runner for enhanced test output formatting and debugging in Python's unittest framework, with integration for Django and rich library features.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes from standard library, Django testing framework, and rich library for console output.",
  "sinks": "Console output methods, exception info conversion, and test result data collection.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test execution to console output, error/exception handling, and traceback formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data manipulation observed. Use of sys.version_info for conditional logic and rich library for styling is typical. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for enhanced test result reporting with styled console output using rich, including error/skip/failure handling, traceback formatting, and custom test runners. The imports are from standard, Django, and rich libraries, all legitimate for a testing utility. No suspicious data flows, external network calls, or hidden backdoors. The use of sys.version_info and conditional logic appears to handle version compatibility, not malicious obfuscation. Overall, this appears to be a well-structured testing utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, styled test reporting extension for Python's unittest and Django testing framework. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage indicators. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
