  "purpose": "Extend Django management shell command to include rich.pretty installation for enhanced console output.",
  "sources": "Import statements for future annotations, Django's management command, and rich.pretty; the handle method which calls pretty.install() and super().handle().",
  "sinks": "pretty.install() is a sink that modifies the console output; super().handle() invokes the parent command's handle method, which executes the management command logic.",
  "flows": "The handle method flows from input (management command invocation) to calling pretty.install() (which modifies console output) and then executing the parent handle method, executing the command's core logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or unusual code behaviors detected. The use of rich.pretty.install() is for aesthetic output enhancement and is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's management command to include rich.pretty installation, which improves console output formatting. It does not perform any network operations, data collection, or system modifications. The code structure is straightforward, invoking a standard library for output formatting before proceeding with the default command behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension for better CLI aesthetics with no malicious intent or security issues. It leverages a known library for output enhancement without performing any suspicious actions.",
