  "purpose": "Enhance terminal output formatting in Django management shell commands using the rich library.",
  "sources": "Imports from rich library (`rich.pretty`) and Django's management command handling (`super().handle`).",
  "sinks": "The call to `super().handle()` executes the original command logic; `pretty.install()` modifies output formatting but does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code calls `pretty.install()` before delegating to the parent command's `handle()` method, affecting only output formatting without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is straightforward and uses well-known library functions for aesthetic purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's command to include `rich.pretty.install()`, which enhances CLI output aesthetics. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of `rich` library functions is benign, intended solely for output formatting. The code structure is simple, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its benign, cosmetic nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, cosmetic enhancement for CLI output with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
