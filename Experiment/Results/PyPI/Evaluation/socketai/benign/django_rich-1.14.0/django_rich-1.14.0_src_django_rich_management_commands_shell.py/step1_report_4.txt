{
  "purpose": "Enhance the Django management shell with rich pretty printing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'from rich import pretty' and 'from django.core.management.commands.shell import Command as BaseCommand', and the handle method that calls pretty.install()",
  "sinks": "Calling super().handle(**options) passes control to the parent command; 'pretty.install()' modifies pretty printing behavior but does not handle untrusted data directly",
  "flows": "The handle method executes 'pretty.install()' then proceeds to execute the parent handle method, which may handle user commands in the shell environment",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic; 'pretty.install()' is a benign function from the 'rich' library intended for formatting",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's shell command to include 'rich' library's pretty printing capabilities. The 'pretty.install()' function enhances the output formatting but does not involve untrusted data or pose security risks. The superclass handle method is called afterward to maintain standard behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension for improving command-line output formatting in Django's shell environment. It does not contain malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate, benign enhancement.",
