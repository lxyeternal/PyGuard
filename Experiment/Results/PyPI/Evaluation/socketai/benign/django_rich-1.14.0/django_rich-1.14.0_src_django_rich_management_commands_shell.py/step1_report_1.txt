{
  "purpose": "The code extends a Django management command to include rich library features for better shell display, specifically installing rich.pretty's pretty-printing capabilities before executing the parent command.",
  "sources": "Import statements for __future__, typing.Any, Django's management command class, and rich.pretty installation.",
  "sinks": "super().handle(**options) calls the parent command's handle method; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves installing rich.pretty and then invoking the parent command's handle method, which may process user input or execute commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior observed. The code only enhances the shell output with rich's pretty-printing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, extends a Django command class, overrides the handle method to install rich.pretty's pretty printing, and then calls the parent handle method. This enhancement improves the shell experience but does not introduce any data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors. It appears to be a benign modification intended for better output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of Django's management command to incorporate rich library features for better output formatting. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is a standard, safe enhancement.",
