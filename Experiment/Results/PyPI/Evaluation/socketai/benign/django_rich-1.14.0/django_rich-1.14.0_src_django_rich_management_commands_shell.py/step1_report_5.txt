  "purpose": "Extend Django management shell command to include enhanced output formatting with rich library",
  "sources": "Import statements for django.core.management.commands.shell and rich.pretty.install()",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks observed; no untrusted data processing or external data handling",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink; mainly initialization and method call",
  "anomalies": "Use of rich.pretty.install() is a cosmetic enhancement, not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code subclasses Django's shell command to install rich's pretty-printing capabilities, which improves output readability. It calls super().handle() without modifying or intercepting data, and no user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling is evident. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be for improving developer experience rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for aesthetic enhancement of the Django shell, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
