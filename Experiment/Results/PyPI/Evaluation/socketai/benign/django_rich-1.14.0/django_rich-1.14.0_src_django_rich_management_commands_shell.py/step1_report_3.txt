{
  "purpose": "Enhances Django management shell with rich library's pretty printing capabilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration via the handle method and imports the 'pretty' module from 'rich'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'pretty.install()' which modifies the pretty printing behavior but does not directly perform any data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Code flow is from handle method invocation -> 'pretty.install()' -> superclass handle method; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Use of 'pretty.install()' is typical for enabling enhanced output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Django's management command to include rich's pretty printing by invoking 'pretty.install()' during command execution. There are no data leaks, network operations, or suspicious code constructs. The code functions solely to improve terminal output aesthetics. No obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended to augment the Django management shell with better output formatting. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
