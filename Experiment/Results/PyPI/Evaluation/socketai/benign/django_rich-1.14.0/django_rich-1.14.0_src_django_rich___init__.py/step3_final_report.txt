  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code handling user data, data processing functions, input/output points, environment variables, external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Data output, network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to output or external interactions, potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity, no hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The malware scores are zero, matching the benign descriptions. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in handling user data but not indicating actual vulnerabilities. Confidence levels are high where code clarity is sufficient; slightly lower where context is limited. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified across reports. The scoring aligns with the descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
