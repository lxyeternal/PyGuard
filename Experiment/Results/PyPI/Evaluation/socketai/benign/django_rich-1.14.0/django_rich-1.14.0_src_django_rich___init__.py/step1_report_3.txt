  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be determined definitively from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, function parameters, or external data files (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or execution commands that could process untrusted data (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and then to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies are evident; however, absence of context about data validation or sanitization raises concerns. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward with standard Python syntax. Without explicit input handling or suspicious function calls, there are no obvious malicious behaviors. The lack of context limits the ability to identify malicious intent. No suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution or obfuscated code are present in the snippet provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but incomplete context prevents a thorough assessment. No malicious intent or malware detected.",
