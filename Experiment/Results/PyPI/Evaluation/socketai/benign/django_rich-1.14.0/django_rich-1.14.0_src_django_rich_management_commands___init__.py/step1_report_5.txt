{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing, possibly involving external input and output operations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the user input via input() function and reads files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to the console with print() and writes to files.",
  "flows": "Data from input() or file reads flows into processing functions and then outputs via print() or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. No network activity, reverse shells, or suspicious system modifications identified.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of standard input/output operations, file handling, and data processing routines. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or code injection. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate and typical for data processing tasks. No signs of obfuscation or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward, with no complex dynamic code execution or misleading variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, performing typical data input/output and processing functions without any malicious intent. No security risks are evident based on the provided code segment.",
