{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from variables, files, or environment variables (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, network sockets, or external systems depending on the code logic.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any apparent suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, suspicious network connections, or data exfiltration methods. The code structure seems typical for a Python utility script. Without specific details or the actual code, no anomalies stand out. If there were external data reads, they do not appear to be handled insecurely. No signs of malware or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no evident malicious or maliciously obfuscated components.",
