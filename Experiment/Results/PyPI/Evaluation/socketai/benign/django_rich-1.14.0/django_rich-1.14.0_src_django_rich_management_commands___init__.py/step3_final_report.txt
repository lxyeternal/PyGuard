  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input/output operations, environment variables, data processing functions, file handling, network connections (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network transmissions, file writes, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (network, file system, environment).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify when code is missing and assign low confidence and scores accordingly. Descriptions of code as benign, standard data processing scripts with no suspicious patterns justify malware and obfuscation scores of zero. Security risk scores of approximately 0.2 are reasonable, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The high confidence levels (0.9) in reports describing benign code are appropriate. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, and the cautious approach for missing code is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The scoring aligns with the provided descriptions, and the overall security assessment indicates low risk.",
