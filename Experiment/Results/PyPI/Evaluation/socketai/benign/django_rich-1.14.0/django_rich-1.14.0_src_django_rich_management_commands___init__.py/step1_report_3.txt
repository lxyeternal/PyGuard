  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a Python script that performs some data processing or communication, but the specific function is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, imported modules, and possibly user input via function parameters or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through processing logic, potentially reaching network or system operation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The code uses standard library functions, and no malicious patterns are detected in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes variables, imports common modules, and executes straightforward logic. No indications of code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior are present. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity. The code appears typical and benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard Python script without suspicious patterns.",
