  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"0.9.1\"\n```\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- They consistently identify the code as benign, standard, and without any suspicious activity, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence level in each report is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is harmless.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the assessment that there's no malicious intent.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it is a straightforward assignment with no inputs, outputs, or data flows.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code is typical for Python package versioning.\n\n### Flaws or Logical Issues:\n- No issues are identified in the reports or the code. The assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, justified by the code's benign nature.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports are thorough and agree that this code snippet is harmless.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is based solely on the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\nGiven the code and the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign a risk score higher than 0, it would require evidence of malicious intent or vulnerability, which is absent here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign and standard.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores accurately reflect the code's nature.",
