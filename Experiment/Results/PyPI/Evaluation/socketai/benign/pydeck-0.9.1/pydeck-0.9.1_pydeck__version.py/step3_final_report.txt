  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard version assignment with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is clear, minimal, and typical for its purpose. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and reflect the harmless nature of the snippet.",
