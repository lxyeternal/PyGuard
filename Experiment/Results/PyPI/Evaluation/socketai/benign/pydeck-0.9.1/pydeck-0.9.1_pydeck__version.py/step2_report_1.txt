  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs. The code snippet is straightforward and typical for Python packages. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `obfuscated`: 0\n- `malware`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0  \nThese are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is just a version string assignment with no inputs, outputs, or suspicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.0 would be unjustified. The current scores of 0 align with this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo questionable assumptions are present. The reports correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no inputs, outputs, or suspicious patterns. The scores are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0",
