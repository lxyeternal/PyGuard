  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is simply: `__version__ = \"0.9.1\"`. There are no inputs, data flows, or external interactions. This is a standard practice for Python packages, and the code snippet is minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, anomalies, or malicious behavior. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree on zero for malware and security risk, and the code is trivial, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns. The malware score should remain 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are cautious and avoid assumptions, correctly stating that this is a standard version assignment.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code snippet and the reports' reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk concerns are present here.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, typical version assignment in Python packages.",
