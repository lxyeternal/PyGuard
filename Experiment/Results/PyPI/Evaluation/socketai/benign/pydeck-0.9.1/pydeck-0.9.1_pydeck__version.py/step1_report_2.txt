  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only version string assignment, no anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a static version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages for versioning. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no potential data leakage points. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version string assignment with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
