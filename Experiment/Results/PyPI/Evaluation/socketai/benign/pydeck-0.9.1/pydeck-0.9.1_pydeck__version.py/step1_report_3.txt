  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is minimal",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. This is a common practice for Python packages to specify their version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. No external data is read, written, or processed. The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for Python packages. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
