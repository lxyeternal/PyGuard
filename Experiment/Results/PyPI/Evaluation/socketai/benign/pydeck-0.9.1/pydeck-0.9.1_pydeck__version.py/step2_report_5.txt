  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, sinks, or any suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is a standard practice in Python packaging.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and typical for version declaration.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no reason exists to assign a high risk score.\n   - The risk score of 0 in all reports is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which aligns with the code's harmless nature.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is a standard version declaration.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are suggested.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code snippet is a minimal, standard version assignment in Python, with no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
