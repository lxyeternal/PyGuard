  "purpose": "Define a class representing viewport state for map visualization, including geographic and zoom parameters.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input sources are read in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class simply stores parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'ViewState' inheriting from 'JSONMixin' with an initializer setting various map-related attributes. It includes standard docstrings explaining parameters. The class appears to be a data container without any external input/output operations or complex logic. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward data structure for map view state parameters with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
