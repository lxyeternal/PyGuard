{
  "purpose": "Define a class for representing viewport state with geographic and zoom parameters, extending JSON serialization capabilities.",
  "sources": "Import from .json_tools module, class initialization parameters, kwargs update",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is written to external sources, no network or file I/O in this code",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to object attributes; no untrusted data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward class definition with no hidden or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that models viewport state, inheriting JSON serialization features. It initializes attributes based on provided parameters, with an optional kwargs update. No external inputs, outputs, or network operations are present. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign class definition intended for managing viewport state data. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
