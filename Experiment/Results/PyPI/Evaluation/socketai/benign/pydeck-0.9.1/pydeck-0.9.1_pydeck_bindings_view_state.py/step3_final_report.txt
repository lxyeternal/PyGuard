{
  "purpose": "A class representing viewport state parameters such as location, zoom, pitch, and bearing, used for map visualization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method, including optional kwargs for dynamic attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; no external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned directly to instance variables; kwargs update the instance dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of self.__dict__.update(kwargs) allows dynamic attribute addition, but not malicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class inheriting from JSONMixin, with straightforward attribute assignments. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The use of kwargs for dynamic attributes is common and not suspicious here. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The class appears benign and intended for state representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data model with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
