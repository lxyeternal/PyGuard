  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.1 is justified, primarily due to the use of __dict__.update(kwargs), which could be exploited if untrusted data is passed. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose."
