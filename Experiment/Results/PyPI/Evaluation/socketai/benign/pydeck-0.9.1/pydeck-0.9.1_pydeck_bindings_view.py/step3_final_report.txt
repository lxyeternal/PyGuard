  "purpose": "Configuration class for a deck.gl view, managing display parameters and attributes.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, property getter/setter for 'type', and kwargs passed to __dict__.update().",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted kwargs passed to __dict__.update(), which could introduce unexpected attributes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and kwargs flow into object attributes, with 'type' managed via property, and kwargs updating __dict__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __dict__.update(kwargs) could be exploited if kwargs contain malicious data, but no malicious code or external data flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class with standard patterns. No network, file, or system commands are used. The dynamic attribute assignment via __dict__.update(kwargs) is common but can be risky if untrusted data is passed; however, no such context is provided. The property for 'type' correctly manages access to the '@@type' key. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code, with minor concern about dynamic attribute assignment if input is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.1 is justified, primarily due to the use of __dict__.update(kwargs), which could be exploited if untrusted data is passed. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
