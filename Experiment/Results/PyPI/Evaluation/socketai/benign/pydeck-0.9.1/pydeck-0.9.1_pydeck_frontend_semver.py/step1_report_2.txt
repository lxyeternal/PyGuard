  "purpose": "Define a semantic versioning constraint for the DECKGL library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Only a version string is defined; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version constraint string to a variable named DECKGL_SEMVER. There are no input operations, data processing, or other behaviors. The string appears to specify a version range compatible with semantic versioning standards. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The code snippet is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets a version string for dependency management. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
