  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple string assignment defining a semantic version constraint for a dependency (`DECKGL_SEMVER = \"~9.0.*\"`). There are no indications of dynamic code, input processing, or any other behavior beyond assigning a string.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for dependency specification. They correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. No logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Malware: 0  \n   - SecurityRisk: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1\n\n   These scores seem reasonable given the simplicity of the code. Since the code is just a version string assignment, there's no basis for higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:  \n   The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the assessment that this code is harmless. There's no need to justify higher scores because there's no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, downloading payloads, or obfuscating logic.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They treat the code as a benign dependency declaration, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. Given the simplicity, the uniformity across reports is justified.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard dependency version constraint declaration with no security issues.\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and do not require adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: No further action needed. The dependency declaration is safe.",
