  "purpose": "Defines a version constraint for the DECKGL package, specifying it should match versions approximately 9.0.x",
  "sources": "The version string assignment to DECKGL_SEMVER",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only assigns a string value",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, setting a version string variable",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version constraint string to a variable. No input processing, no dynamic code, no suspicious behavior. It simply specifies a dependency version range. There are no signs of malicious code or obfuscation. The only operation is a string assignment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, merely setting a dependency version constraint with no malicious intent. It does not pose any security risk.",
