  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to a variable (`DECKGL_SEMVER`) with no input, output, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The original code `DECKGL_SEMVER = \"~9.0.*\"` is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues or vulnerabilities present in the code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a benign dependency version specification.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in these summaries.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - All reports agree on zero risk, which is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior is present.\n   - The malware score of 0 in all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the actual code behavior.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's nature.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward string assignment)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The version string `~9.0.*` is a standard semantic versioning constraint and does not pose any security concern.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate, correctly concluding the code is benign.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll evidence indicates that this code snippet is benign and poses no security threat. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
