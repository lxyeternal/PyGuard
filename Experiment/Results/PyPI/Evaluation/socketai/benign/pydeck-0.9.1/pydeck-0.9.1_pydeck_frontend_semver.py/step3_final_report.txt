  "purpose": "Define the semantic version constraint for the DECKGL library dependency.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a static version string to the variable DECKGL_SEMVER.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward string assignment with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version constraint string '~9.0.*' to the variable DECKGL_SEMVER. There are no input operations, dynamic behaviors, or data processing. The code is a standard dependency declaration, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign dependency version specification with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
