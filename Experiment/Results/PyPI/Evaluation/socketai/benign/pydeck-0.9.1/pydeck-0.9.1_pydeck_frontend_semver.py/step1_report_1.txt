  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only a version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version constraint string to a variable, indicating a dependency version range. It is a straightforward declaration with no dynamic code, input reading, or complex logic. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency version specification with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
