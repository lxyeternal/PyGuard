  "purpose": "Define a version constraint for the DECKGL library, specifying compatibility with versions approximately 9.0.*",
  "sources": "The version string assigned to DECKGL_SEMVER",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; this is just a version specification",
  "flows": "No data flow or data input/output involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '~9.0.*' to the variable DECKGL_SEMVER. This is a typical semantic versioning constraint used in dependency management to specify compatible versions. No untrusted input, no data leakage, no suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for specifying dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless dependency version specification with no malicious intent or security risks.",
