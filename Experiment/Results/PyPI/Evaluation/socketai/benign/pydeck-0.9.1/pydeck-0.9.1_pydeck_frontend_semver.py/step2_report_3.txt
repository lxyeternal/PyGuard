  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable (`DECKGL_SEMVER`).\n   - There are no input operations, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign dependency version specification.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The current score of 0 for `securityRisk` and `malware` is justified.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores based on the provided code.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they simply state that the code is a straightforward dependency version specification.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard dependency version declaration.\n- There are no security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final Remarks:**\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or security risk. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and should remain as is.",
