{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class 'Deck' for rendering and configuring deck.gl visualizations, primarily in Jupyter notebooks and web environments.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (via os.getenv), API keys passed via parameters, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include setting API keys as object attributes, passing data to HTML templates, and creating files for HTML output.",
  "flows": "API keys are read from environment variables or input parameters and assigned to object attributes; the visualization JSON is generated and passed to HTML renderer functions; HTML output is generated and returned or displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious dynamic execution. The code's use of environment variables for API keys is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles visualization setup, environment detection, and HTML rendering. It conditionally imports widgets for Jupyter support, reads API keys securely from environment variables or parameters, and outputs HTML content. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system sabotage. The code follows typical patterns for visualization libraries and does not contain hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard visualization utility with no malicious intent. It securely manages API keys via environment variables, uses conditional imports for optional Jupyter integration, and generates HTML for visualization. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
