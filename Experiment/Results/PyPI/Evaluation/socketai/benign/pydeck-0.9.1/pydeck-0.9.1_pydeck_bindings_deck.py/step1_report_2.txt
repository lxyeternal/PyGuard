{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for rendering and configuring a deck.gl visualization, primarily in Jupyter notebooks and web browsers.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables (os.getenv), imports modules, and uses function parameters (e.g., api_keys, map_style).",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables for API keys, and passes these to a map provider object. Generates HTML content via deck_to_html, which may include embedded scripts or data.",
  "flows": "API keys and settings flow from parameters/environment variables into class attributes and HTML generation functions. User data can be included in layers or view states, but no direct untrusted input flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No use of obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution. Import statements and API key handling are standard. Commented-out code indicates potential Jupyter-specific features, but they are not active.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes visualization settings, manages API keys via environment variables, and generates HTML outputs for visualization. API key handling involves reading environment variables and setting class attributes. The to_html method calls an external function to generate HTML content, potentially embedding scripts or map data, but no evidence of malicious payloads. The class contains typical visualization setup logic without suspicious or malicious behavior. No unusual data flows, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The only notable point is the reliance on environment variables for API keys, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization configuration class with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It manages API keys securely via environment variables, generates visualization HTML, and includes standard functionality for Jupyter notebooks. No malware or security risks are detected.",
