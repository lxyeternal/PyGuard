{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton Settings class for configuring pydeck, allowing registration of custom libraries and other settings.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily sets up a class and a singleton instance without external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no functions or code paths that handle untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as there are no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code enforces a singleton pattern via an assertion in __init__, which could prevent multiple instances but is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Settings class with parameters for custom libraries, configuration, and default attributes. It asserts to prevent multiple instances, ensuring singleton behavior. The register_library method adds library info to a list. The singleton instance is created if none exists. No external data handling, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration singleton pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages configuration data for pydeck and does not contain any malicious behavior.",
