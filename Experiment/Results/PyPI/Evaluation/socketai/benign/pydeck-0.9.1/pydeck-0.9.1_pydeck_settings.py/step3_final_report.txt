  "purpose": "Manage global pydeck settings with singleton enforcement, allowing registration of custom libraries.",
  "sources": "Initialization of 'settings' variable; instantiation of Settings object; 'register_library' method appending to 'custom_libraries' list.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network calls, or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Instantiation flow from global 'settings' to singleton Settings instance; 'register_library' appending data to internal list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert not settings' in __init__ to enforce singleton; unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for configuration management, with a method to register custom libraries. It does not process external untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any malicious code. The singleton enforcement via assertion could be bypassed if Python runs with optimizations, but this is a known pattern and not a security concern. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard singleton configuration class with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The singleton enforcement method is unconventional but not harmful. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly zero.",
