  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a singleton pattern for managing pydeck settings, with methods to register custom libraries.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or data leaks are identified.\n- The code enforces singleton behavior via an assert statement in the constructor, which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, and security risks are minimal (around 0.1 or 0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the described singleton pattern, with `settings` being a singleton instance.\n- **Functionality:** No evidence of malicious behavior; the code manages configuration data only.\n- **Potential issues:** The singleton enforcement via `assert not settings` is unusual but not harmful.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The use of `assert not settings` in `__init__` enforces singleton behavior but can be bypassed if Python is run with optimizations (`-O`), which disables assertions. This could allow multiple instances, but it doesn't introduce security risks.\n- No other significant flaws or malicious patterns.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware:** Correctly 0 across all reports; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Scores are low (~0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores > 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The singleton enforcement via assertion could be considered a minor flaw, but not a security risk. The overall risk remains low.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The singleton pattern enforcement via `assert` could be circumvented, but this is a minor implementation detail and not malicious.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated components.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to singleton enforcement method, but not a security concern)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard singleton configuration class for pydeck with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes needed. The code and reports indicate a safe, well-structured configuration utility with no malicious intent.",
