{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton class for managing global settings related to pydeck, including custom libraries, configuration, and default layer attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method, method arguments in register_library, class attributes",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows leading to external systems or sensitive data exposure",
  "flows": "Initialization assigns provided parameters; register_library appends to custom_libraries list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern via an assertion in __init__, preventing multiple instances. It manages settings related to pydeck visualization, including custom library URLs. No external data sources, no dangerous data handling, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The register_library method allows dynamic addition of libraries but does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration utility for pydeck.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for pydeck with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It safely manages settings and allows dynamic registration of libraries without exposing sensitive data or executing malicious code.",
