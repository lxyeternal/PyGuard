{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton Settings class for configuring pydeck, including custom libraries, configuration, and default layer attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ and register_library methods, and the initial assignment to the global 'settings' variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or use untrusted inputs for critical operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily sets internal state without external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The assertion in __init__ prevents multiple instances, ensuring singleton behavior. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton class 'Settings' that manages configuration for pydeck. It prevents multiple instances via an assertion. The class provides methods to add custom libraries and store configuration attributes. The initial global 'settings' variable is instantiated only if not already set, ensuring singleton pattern. No external data sources, network connections, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a singleton configuration holder for pydeck settings with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard configuration class without any malicious intent.",
