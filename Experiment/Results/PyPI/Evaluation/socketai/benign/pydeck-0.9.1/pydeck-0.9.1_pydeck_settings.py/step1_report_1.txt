{
  "purpose": "Defines a singleton class for managing global settings in the pydeck library, including custom library registration.",
  "sources": "Class constructor (__init__), register_library method, and the initial assignment of the settings variable.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up a singleton pattern and allows modification of a list of custom libraries, but does not process external untrusted input in a dangerous way.",
  "anomalies": "The singleton enforcement via an assert statement in the constructor is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for global settings management with a class that allows adding custom libraries. The assert statement prevents multiple instantiations of Settings, enforcing singleton behavior. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The methods and logic are straightforward, focusing on configuration management. The design is safe, and no suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a safe singleton pattern for managing configuration settings in a Python module. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It appears to be standard application code with no indicators of compromise.",
