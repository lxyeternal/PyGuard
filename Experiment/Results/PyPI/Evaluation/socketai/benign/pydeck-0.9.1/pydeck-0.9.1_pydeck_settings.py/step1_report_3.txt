{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton class for managing global settings related to pydeck, including custom libraries and configurations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the Settings constructor, the class attribute default values, and the register_library method inputs.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the singleton settings object; potential flow from external code calling register_library to modify custom_libraries.",
  "anomalies": "The code asserts that only one Settings instance can exist, which is a standard singleton pattern; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton Settings class to manage configuration for pydeck, with methods to initialize and register libraries. There is no evidence of data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The class design appears straightforward and intended for configuration management. No external data sources or sinks are involved; the only flow is through method calls and object instantiation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration singleton pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages user-defined settings for pydeck libraries and configurations without involving any sensitive data or external communication.",
