      "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup/build utility with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight risk score reflects the inherent risks in executing external commands and dynamic code loading, but these are typical and controlled in trusted build environments."

The low risk score of 0.1 is justified, primarily due to the use of __dict__.update(kwargs), which could be exploited if untrusted data is passed. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose."
