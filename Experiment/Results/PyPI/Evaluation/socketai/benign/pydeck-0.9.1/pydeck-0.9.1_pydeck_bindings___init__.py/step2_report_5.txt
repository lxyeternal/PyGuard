  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules and packages.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The use of '# noqa' comments is standard for suppressing linter warnings, not malicious indicators.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger modular project, likely related to graphical or mapping functionalities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static import statements with no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors:**  \n  None detected. All reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - **Malware score:**  \n    All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n  - **Security risk score:**  \n    Slight variation (some reports give 0, others 0.1). Given the static import statements, a score of 0 is more justified. The 0.1 might overstate risk without evidence.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is observed, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No report assumes any malicious intent; all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities based on the code snippet.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; all are low or zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — static imports with no data handling or execution logic pose no security risk.\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard module import setup, typical in Python projects. It does not perform any runtime operations, handle untrusted data, or include any suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI concur with the assessments provided. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at zero across malware and risk metrics, reflecting the absence of any security concern.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural and organizational within a larger codebase, with no security implications.",
