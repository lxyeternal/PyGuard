  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   The code consists solely of static import statements:\n   ```python\n   from .deck import Deck  # noqa\n   from .layer import Layer  # noqa\n   from .light_settings import LightSettings  # noqa\n   from .view import View  # noqa\n   from .view_state import ViewState  # noqa\n   from . import map_styles  # noqa\n   ```\n   No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing is present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that this is a simple import setup.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - Use of `# noqa` is standard for suppressing linter warnings, not malicious.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no runtime data handling or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The only slight exception is report 3, which assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, possibly reflecting a conservative stance, but given the static import nature, this is probably overly cautious.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely static imports with no runtime or data processing, a risk score above 0.1 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores seem reasonable; no justification exists for higher scores.\n\n6. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns.\n   - The analysis is sound.\n\n8. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - The very low or zero scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Overall Systematic Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (appropriate, given the static import nature)\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code snippet is a straightforward module import setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
