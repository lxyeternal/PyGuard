  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\nThe provided code consists solely of static import statements importing local modules and classes, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing. The '# noqa' comments are used to suppress linter warnings, which is standard practice. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities in this fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly imports modules/classes from the local package. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risks:** Static imports with no runtime data handling pose minimal security risk.\n\n### Analysis of the Reports:\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and does not contain malicious or security concerns. They emphasize that the code is only importing modules/classes, with no data flow, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1. Given the static nature and lack of data handling, a score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- One report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is slightly higher than justified. Since no data flow or untrusted input is present, this should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n- The overall confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, the scores should be:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, static, and well-understood nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is simply a set of import statements.\n- No further security concerns are evident.\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThis code is safe, non-malicious, and poses no security risks. The current scoring, especially the malware and obfuscated scores, is appropriate. The slight elevation in security risk in one report should be adjusted to zero for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual nature and the consensus of the reports.",
