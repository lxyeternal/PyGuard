{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and classes from the current package, likely setting up dependencies for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules and classes from the local package directory",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or untrusted data handling detected",
  "flows": "N/A; only import statements are present, no data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed; import statements are standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no executable logic, data processing, or untrusted input handling. The imports are from local modules and include classes and submodules, which suggests modular organization. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a straightforward module import setup, common in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to import dependencies within a package. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based solely on these import statements.",
