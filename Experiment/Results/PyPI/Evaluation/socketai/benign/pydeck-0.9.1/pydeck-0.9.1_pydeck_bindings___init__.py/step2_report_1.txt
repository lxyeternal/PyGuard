  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple static import statements from local modules and packages.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or user input handling is mentioned.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are identified.\n- The use of '# noqa' comments is standard practice to suppress linting warnings, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger, modular Python project, likely related to graphical or mapping functionalities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n- The original code is straightforward: only import statements.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code snippet itself.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The use of relative imports with '# noqa' is standard and not suspicious.\n- No flawed reasoning or misinterpretation is evident in the reports.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, or security risk scores as zero or near zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The third report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, which is slightly higher but still minimal and justifiable given the lack of context.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The highest assigned risk is 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports assign malware scores as 0, which is correct.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports suggest the code is \"likely\" part of a larger application, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond the static import statements.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9-1), reflecting the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Keep the scores at 0 for malware and obfuscated.\n- Maintain a security risk score of 0, possibly 0.1 if considering the use of '# noqa' as a minor concern, but generally, it’s standard practice.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code snippet is a standard set of import statements with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
