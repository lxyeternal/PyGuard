  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is only performing static import statements from local modules. No data processing, dynamic code execution, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (since no security concern is identified). The report's score of 0 is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.9). The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 is appropriate; the report assigns 0, which is acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, only static imports. The mention of `securityRisk` at 0.1 is slightly higher but still very low, and the reasoning does not suggest any actual security concern.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The risk score of 0.1 might be slightly overcautious but is still low enough not to raise concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The report's scores are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the low risk score reflects cautiousness.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward imports with no issues.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The risk score is 0, which is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of **0** for all.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. I agree with **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since these are static import statements with no dynamic behavior, the risk is minimal. The highest assigned risk score is 0.1, which is acceptable. I would assign a risk score of **0** for all, considering the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is purely structural, part of a larger project, and contains no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
