{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes, likely for a larger application related to visual or graphical functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing local modules and classes: .deck, .layer, .light_settings, .view, .view_state, and .map_styles",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present; the code does not handle untrusted input or output data directly",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports with noqa comments is standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements to load internal modules and classes. No execution of dynamic code, network calls, or data handling occurs here. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'noqa' indicates suppression of linting errors but does not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard set of import statements for modular components within a larger project. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The snippet is benign and typical for Python projects.",
