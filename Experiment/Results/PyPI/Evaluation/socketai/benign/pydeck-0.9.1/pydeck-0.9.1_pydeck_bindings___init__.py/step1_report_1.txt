{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various classes and modules related to a graphical or mapping application, likely for organizing components such as decks, layers, light settings, views, and view states.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (deck, layer, light_settings, view, view_state) and a module (map_styles). These are static import statements and do not involve dynamic input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or security issues, as no functions, network calls, or data processing occur in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The use of '# noqa' comments indicates suppression of linter warnings but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements to local modules and a package (map_styles). No runtime data processing, user input, or network activity is present. The imports are standard for a modular Python project. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment. The '# noqa' comments are commonly used to suppress linter warnings about unused imports or style issues, not indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of import statements for a Python package or module, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a larger project related to graphical or map-based functionalities.",
