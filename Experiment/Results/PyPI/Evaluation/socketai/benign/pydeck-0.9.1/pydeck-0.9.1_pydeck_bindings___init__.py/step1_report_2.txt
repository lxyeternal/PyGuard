{
  "purpose": "The code is importing modules and classes related to a larger project, likely for a graphical or mapping application.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and classes from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import statements do not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements with no data processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The use of '# noqa' comments is standard for ignoring linting issues and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements importing modules and classes from within the same package, including 'deck', 'layer', 'light_settings', 'view', 'view_state', and 'map_styles'. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, no network communication, and no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The '# noqa' comments are used to suppress linter warnings and are not indicative of malicious intent. Since the code is static and only involves imports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import block for a package, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It does not process untrusted data or perform any potentially harmful operations.",
