  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the local package, likely related to graphical or mapping functionalities, serving as setup or initialization.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules and packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static imports, no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statements with standard comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing classes and modules from the local package. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or data processing. The use of '# noqa' comments is standard practice to suppress linting warnings. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of static import statements with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
