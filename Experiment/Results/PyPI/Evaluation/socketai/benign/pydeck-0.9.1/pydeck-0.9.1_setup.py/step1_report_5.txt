  "purpose": "Setup script for the pydeck Python package, including building frontend assets, registering widget components with Jupyter, and packaging the library.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, reads version info from a file, reads files like README.md, and reads command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Executes shell commands (check_call), copies files, removes files, and runs external scripts (postBuild).",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file reads influence execution of shell commands and file operations, affecting build and installation processes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec to run contents of _version.py, which could be risky if the file is tampered with, but common in setup scripts; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; external commands are run but in a controlled context.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for building a Python package with frontend components. It uses subprocess calls to execute 'npm' and 'yarn' for frontend builds, copies static files, and registers custom commands. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful commands is evident. The use of exec on a version file is typical but should be secure if the file is trusted. The script interacts with environment variables and external commands, which is standard for build scripts but should be executed in trusted environments. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for building and packaging a Python widget with frontend assets. It does not contain malicious code or behavior. It relies on external tools like npm and yarn but does not perform any harmful actions. The overall security risk is low.",
