{
  "purpose": "The setup script for configuring and building the pydeck Python package, including frontend assets and Jupyter widget integration.",
  "sources": "Reading files (pydeck/_version.py, README.md), environment variables (PATH), command outputs (npm, yarn versions), user input (sys.argv), and file system operations (os.remove, copy).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (check_call, check_output) executing build commands, file operations (os.remove, copy), environment variable modifications, and registering exit hooks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command outputs influence subprocess execution; file operations depend on build processes and user commands; hooks execute scripts post-installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with potential for executing external commands; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution; the code appears standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, environment checks, and frontend build automation. It uses subprocess calls to run npm/yarn commands, copies static files, and registers post-install hooks. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The use of environment variables and subprocesses is typical for build scripts, and there are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification beyond standard build operations, or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup and build script for a Python package with Jupyter widget integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
