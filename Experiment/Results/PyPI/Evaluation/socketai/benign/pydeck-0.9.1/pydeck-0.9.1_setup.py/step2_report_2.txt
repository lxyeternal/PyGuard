  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build/setup for pydeck, reads version info via `exec` on `_version.py`, uses environment variables, and files like README.md.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes external commands (`bash postBuild`, `npm`, `yarn`), copies files, modifies environment variables.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of `exec` on version file is common but could be risky if the file is maliciously altered. External commands are standard for build processes. No suspicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical build script. Malware score: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2 (low). Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- Similar in scope—build/setup for pydeck, involving environment checks, subprocess calls, file operations.  \n- No suspicious code, no malicious patterns.  \n- Use of subprocess and environment variables is standard.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- Same pattern: reads version info, runs build commands (`npm`, `yarn`), copies static files.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- Similar assessment: setup, build, execute external commands, no malicious intent.  \n- Use of `exec` on version file is typical but could be risky if compromised.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- Same as above: standard build script, external commands, file copying, no malicious patterns.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or covert channels.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is straightforward and typical for setup scripts.  \n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher where `exec` is used on version files, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts, assuming the version file is trusted. External commands like `npm`, `yarn`, and `bash` scripts are standard for frontend builds.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the standard nature and lack of malicious activity, a low risk score (~0.1 to 0.2) is appropriate, with some minor caution due to execution of external scripts and `exec` on version files.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (very low, typical for build scripts)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments, which consistently find no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the version file (`pydeck/_version.py`) is securely maintained and verified, as `exec` on any file carries some inherent risk if the file is compromised.",
