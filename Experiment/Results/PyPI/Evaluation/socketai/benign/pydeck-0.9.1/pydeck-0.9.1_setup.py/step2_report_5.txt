  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script reading version info, environment variables, and files.\n- **Sinks:** Executes external commands, copies files, runs bash scripts.\n- **Flows:** Typical build and install flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `exec` on version file; external commands like `bash postBuild`, `npm`, `yarn`.\n- **Analysis:** All activities are standard for a build script. The `exec` on version file is common but could be risky if the file is malicious. External commands are run in controlled environments, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious behavior detected. The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the external command executions, which could be exploited if environment is compromised.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, handling build automation.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess calls, file operations, environment modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard build procedures.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; typical for build scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup, reading version info, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** External commands (`bash postBuild`, `npm`, `yarn`), file copying.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `exec` on version file; external command execution.\n- **Analysis:** Routine build steps; no malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Security risk remains very low; scores are appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Packaging and building frontend assets.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `exec` on version file; external commands.\n- **Analysis:** Typical setup process; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, scores appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, build automation.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `exec` on version file, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build script.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low risk.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, remote control, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher (around 0.2) due to external command execution and use of `exec` on version files, but these are common in build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — typical for build scripts that execute external commands and run scripts, but no malicious activity.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a standard setup/build script with no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Overall security assessment:** The code is safe, with minimal risk associated with typical build procedures. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present.",
