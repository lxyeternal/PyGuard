  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup/build utility for 'pydeck'. It notes reading version info via exec from '_version.py', environment variables, and input files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External commands ('bash postBuild', 'npm', 'yarn') are executed, and files are copied. The flow is standard for build scripts.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The use of 'exec' on the version file is common but could be risky if the file is malicious. External commands are invoked based on command-line args and environment, which could be manipulated if environment is compromised, but no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior detected; standard build script. The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, and malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's role in setup and build automation, including environment variables and file reads.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess calls to run npm/yarn commands, copies files, and registers hooks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or malicious activity. The subprocess calls are typical, and no secrets or obfuscated code are present.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low security risk score (0.1) and malware score (0) are appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states the script's role. Reads version info via 'exec', environment variables, and files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Runs build commands ('npm', 'yarn'), copies static files, and registers post-install hooks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The use of 'exec' on version info is standard but could be a vector if the version file is malicious. External commands are necessary for building frontend assets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected. The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's functions—building, registering, packaging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes build commands, copies files, runs post-build scripts.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious behavior. Use of 'exec' is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate low risk and malware scores.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Also correctly identifies the script's role. Reads version info via 'exec', environment variables, and files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Runs 'npm', 'yarn', copies files, executes postBuild.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; use of 'exec' is standard but should be trusted.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, low risk.\n\n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious activity:** No. All reports agree the script is a standard setup/build utility.\n- **Use of 'exec' on version file:** Common in setup scripts, but it could be a vector if the version file is compromised. However, no evidence suggests this is malicious.\n- **External command execution ('bash', 'npm', 'yarn'):** Necessary for frontend build steps; no malicious intent detected.\n- **File operations:** Copying and deleting static files are standard.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard nature of the script, a low to moderate score is justified. The highest is 0.2, which seems appropriate considering the execution of external commands and 'exec' on version info, which are typical in build scripts but could be vectors if environment is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — considering the use of 'exec' and external commands, but these are standard for such scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Continuous monitoring and verifying the integrity of files like '_version.py' are recommended, but based on the provided code and reports, there are no security concerns.",
