  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core logic, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a setup utility for 'pydeck', handling build, packaging, and installation, including frontend build steps. It uses `exec` to load version info, runs external commands (`bash postBuild`, `npm`, `yarn`), and copies static files.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  - The use of `exec` on the version file (`pydeck/_version.py`) is standard but could be risky if the file is malicious or compromised.  \n  - External commands executed (`bash`, `npm`, `yarn`) depend on environment trustworthiness.  \n  - No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, reflecting typical build script risks, mainly from external command execution and file execution.  \n- **Score Justification:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate; the overall risk is minimal, assuming environment integrity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on setup, build automation, and environment checks. It runs `npm`, `yarn`, copies static files, and registers hooks.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  - External commands (`npm`, `yarn`, `bash`) are executed, but this is standard for build scripts.  \n  - No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, very low, given the nature of build scripts.  \n- **Score Justification:** Correctly assigned; no malicious activity suspected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** A standard setup.py that reads version info, executes build commands, copies files, and registers widget components.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  - Uses `exec` on version file, which is common but can be risky if the file is malicious.  \n  - Executes external commands (`bash postBuild`, `npm`, `yarn`).  \n  - No obfuscation or secrets.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, justified.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, consistent with typical build scripts.  \n- **Score Justification:** Appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, handling setup, build, and registration for a Jupyter widget. Executes external commands, copies files, and uses environment variables.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  - `exec` on version file, standard in setup scripts.  \n  - External commands are necessary but could be manipulated if environment is compromised.  \n  - No obfuscation or secrets.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, reasonable.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, still low, reflecting typical build process risks.  \n- **Score Justification:** Valid; no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script, handling build, registration, and packaging. Uses subprocess calls, copies files, executes scripts.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  - `exec` on version file, standard but should be trusted.  \n  - External commands are run, but in controlled contexts.  \n  - No obfuscation or secrets.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, appropriate.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, consistent with standard build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The script is a typical build and setup utility, executing external commands necessary for building frontend assets and registering widgets. No malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is clear and standard for such scripts.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) across reports, reflecting the inherent risks in executing external commands and `exec`-ing files, but nothing beyond typical build process concerns.\n\n### **My Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to external command execution and dynamic code loading, but very low overall.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a standard setup/build script with no malicious intent. The low risk scores reflect the typical security profile of such scripts, assuming a trusted environment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malware detected.  \n- External command execution is necessary but should be run in a trusted environment.  \n- The use of `exec` on version files is common but should be kept secure.  \n- Overall, the setup script poses minimal security risks.",
