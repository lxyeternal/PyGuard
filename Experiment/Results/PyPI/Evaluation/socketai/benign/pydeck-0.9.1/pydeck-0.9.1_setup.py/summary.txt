  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup/build utility with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight risk score reflects the inherent risks in executing external commands and dynamic code loading, but these are typical and controlled in trusted build environments."
