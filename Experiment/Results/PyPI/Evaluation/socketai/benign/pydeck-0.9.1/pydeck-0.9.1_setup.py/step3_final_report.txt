{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup utility for the 'pydeck' package, handling build, packaging, and installation processes, including frontend asset compilation and widget registration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via exec from 'pydeck/_version.py'; accesses environment variables; reads files like README.md; executes external commands ('bash postBuild', 'npm', 'yarn'); copies static files.",
  "sinks": "Executes external commands for building frontend assets; copies static files into package directories; runs post-install bash scripts; modifies environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> executes build commands ('npm', 'yarn') -> copies static files -> runs postBuild script -> registers widget hooks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on version file, which could be risky if the file is maliciously altered; execution of external commands ('bash', 'npm', 'yarn') depends on environment trustworthiness.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup and build tasks typical for a Python package with frontend components. The use of exec() on the version file is common but could be a vector if the file is compromised. External commands are necessary for frontend asset compilation and are executed in controlled environments. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The code is clear, straightforward, and adheres to common patterns in such build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup/build utility with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight risk score reflects the inherent risks in executing external commands and dynamic code loading, but these are typical and controlled in trusted build environments.",
