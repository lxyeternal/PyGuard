{
  "purpose": "Define a class for configuring light settings in a visualization, with parameters for light position, ratios, strength, and count.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a class and its constructor, with no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no output operations, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a straightforward class definition without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be a standard class setup without suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'LightSettings' inheriting from 'JSONMixin'. It includes a detailed docstring explaining parameters and an __init__ method assigning values to instance variables. No external data sources, network calls, or embedded malicious code are present. The use of JSONMixin suggests potential serialization, but no risky behavior is evident. The code appears to be part of a larger visualization project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition for light configuration, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security concerns identified. It is a standard, straightforward implementation without obfuscation or malware indicators.",
