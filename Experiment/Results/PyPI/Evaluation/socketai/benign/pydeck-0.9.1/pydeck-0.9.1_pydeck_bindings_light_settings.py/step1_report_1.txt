{
  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for lighting settings on an aircraft, supporting JSON serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "Imports JSONMixin from a local module; class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external output operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class instance attributes; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears standard for a configuration class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presumed JSON handling mixin and defines a class with parameters for light configuration. Constructor assigns parameters directly to instance attributes without any data processing or external interactions. There are no sources of untrusted input, no external data reads, or sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a purely descriptive purpose, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration class for lighting parameters, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
