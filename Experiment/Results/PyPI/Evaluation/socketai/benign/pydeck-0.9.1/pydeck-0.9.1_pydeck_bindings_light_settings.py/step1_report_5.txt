  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for light settings on an aircraft, including properties like position, intensity, and ratios.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; only class initialization parameters are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being output, stored securely, or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code only sets instance variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The class relies on external JSONMixin, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward data class with initialization parameters for various lighting settings. It imports JSONMixin, likely for JSON serialization/deserialization, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The parameters are optional and default to None or specific values, and the class only stores these parameters without executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign configuration class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
