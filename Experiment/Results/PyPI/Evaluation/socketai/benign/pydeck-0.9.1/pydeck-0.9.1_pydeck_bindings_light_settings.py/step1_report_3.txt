  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for lights on a plane, allowing customization of lighting parameters.",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or data sourcing is present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a straightforward class definition with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'LightSettings' inheriting from 'JSONMixin', used for configuring lighting parameters such as position, ratios, strength, and number of lights. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external calls that could be exploited. The code relies on parameters being set during initialization but does not perform any data validation or security-sensitive operations. The presence of the imported 'JSONMixin' suggests potential serialization capabilities but does not inherently introduce malicious behavior. Overall, this code appears to be a standard data container without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition for lighting settings with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It does not process external input or perform operations that could be exploited.",
