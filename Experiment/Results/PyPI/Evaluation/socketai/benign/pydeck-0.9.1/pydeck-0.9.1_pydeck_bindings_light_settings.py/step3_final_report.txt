  "purpose": "Configuration of lights on the aircraft, including position, ratios, and brightness settings.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to the constructor (lights_position, diffuse_ratio, specular_ratio, lights_strength, ambient_ratio).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the class only assigns parameters to instance variables.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into instance variables without processing or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data container with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class inheriting from JSONMixin, serving as a data container for lighting configuration. It assigns parameters directly to instance variables with no external data input, network activity, or malicious code. The use of JSONMixin suggests serialization but does not introduce risk. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The class is benign and typical for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
