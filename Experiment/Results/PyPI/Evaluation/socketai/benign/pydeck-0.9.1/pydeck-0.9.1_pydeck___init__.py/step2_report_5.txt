  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is observed.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be package setup or initialization, typical for Python libraries.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** consists solely of static import statements from relative modules.\n- No evidence of code execution, external data processing, or malicious activity.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The use of `# noqa` comments suggests linting suppression, not malicious intent.\n- The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it's benign.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, 0 is appropriate. No security risk or supply chain concern is evident.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume that import statements are inherently safe, which is valid here.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward package initialization snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, and the scoring accurately reflects that.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- No changes to scores.\n- No further security concerns.\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets involve dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
