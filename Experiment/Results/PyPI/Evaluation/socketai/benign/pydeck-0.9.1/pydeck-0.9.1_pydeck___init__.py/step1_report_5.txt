{
  "purpose": "Importing various modules and attributes related to a visualization or mapping library, likely for setting up or configuring visual components.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .bindings, .nbextension, ._version, .settings",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the provided code segment",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily imports definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of straightforward import statements with no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of attributes and modules from local package files. There are no indications of data input, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The imported modules suggest functionality related to visualization or mapping. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. All imports are standard for package setup or configuration.\n\nSince the code only imports modules and attributes without executing any untrusted code or handling external data, there is minimal risk. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import section for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
