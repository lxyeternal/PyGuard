  "purpose": "Importing various modules and attributes related to map styling, visualization, and settings for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .bindings, .nbextension, ._version, and .settings",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; imports are static and originate from internal modules",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code consists solely of import statements",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of import statements bringing in functions, classes, and variables from internal modules. There are no runtime inputs, user data, or external network interactions. The structure appears standard for a package's __init__.py or module setup. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The imported modules and attributes are typical for a visualization or mapping library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement block used for setting up package components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
