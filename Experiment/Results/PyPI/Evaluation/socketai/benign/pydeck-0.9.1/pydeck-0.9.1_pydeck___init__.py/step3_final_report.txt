{
  "purpose": "This code imports internal modules related to visualization, Jupyter extension paths, versioning, and settings, serving as a package initialization or setup module.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from relative internal modules",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as there are no dynamic or external data interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from internal modules, typical for package setup. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The use of '# noqa' is standard for lint suppression. All signals indicate benign, standard package initialization code. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
