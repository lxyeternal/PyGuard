  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and related to versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version metadata for a Python package, including version strings and tuples. It uses conditional type checking to assign types, but no external input, network communication, or suspicious logic is present. The code is generated and standard for version management. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
