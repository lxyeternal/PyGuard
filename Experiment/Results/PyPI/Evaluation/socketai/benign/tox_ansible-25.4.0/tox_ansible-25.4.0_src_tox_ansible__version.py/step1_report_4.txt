  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm, including version strings and tuples.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version-related variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples to variables; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear version definitions and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets version-related variables, primarily using hardcoded static strings and tuples. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard practice. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present. The code explicitly states it is generated by setuptools-scm and should not be modified, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration file generated by a build tool. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
