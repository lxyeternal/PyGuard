  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using setuptools-scm conventions.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, hardcoded version variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation; standard version definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated versioning module created by setuptools-scm. It declares version-related variables, handles type checking, and assigns version data statically. No external inputs, network connections, or potentially malicious code are present. It lacks any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code's sole purpose is to provide version info.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
