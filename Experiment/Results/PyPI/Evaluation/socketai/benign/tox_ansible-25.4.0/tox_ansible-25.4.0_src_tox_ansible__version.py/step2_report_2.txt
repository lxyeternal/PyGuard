  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated versioning module created by setuptools-scm.\n   - It defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with hardcoded values.\n   - It includes a `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional to provide type hints without affecting runtime behavior.\n   - There are no external inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n   - The code contains no obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs.\n   - Its sole purpose is to declare static version information.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is a standard, benign version declaration module.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no external data flows, no untrusted input, and no malicious behavior.\n   - The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and no anomalies or security risks are noted.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign, static nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is generated by setuptools-scm and contains no malicious activity.\n   - There are no hidden or obfuscated malicious payloads, and the code does not process untrusted data.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard version metadata file with no security issues.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or assessments.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, and the reports are accurate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
