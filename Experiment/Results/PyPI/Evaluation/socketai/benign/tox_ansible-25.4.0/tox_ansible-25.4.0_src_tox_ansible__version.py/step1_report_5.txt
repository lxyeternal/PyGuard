  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data inputs observed.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors. The __all__ list and type checking are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version-related variables, assigns fixed version strings and tuples, and includes a conditional type-checking block for type hints. No dynamic code execution, no external data input, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version metadata module generated by setuptools-scm with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
