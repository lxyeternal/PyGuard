  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, auto-generated versioning module created by setuptools-scm. The code consists solely of variable assignments, type hints, and metadata declarations with no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the purpose, sources, sinks, and flow of data, emphasizing the benign nature of the code. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, generated nature of the code.  \n- **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign, static version info code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \nSince all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code is clearly non-malicious, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Claims about Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \nNo claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as standard version metadata.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (benign, static version info)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a typical, auto-generated version module with no security concerns.\n- The uniformity of reports and scores supports the conclusion that there are no issues.\n\n**In summary**, the code is a standard, safe version declaration with no malicious or risky elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
