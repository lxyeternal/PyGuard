{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and 'version_tuple' assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no effect on external systems.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded version string flows directly into version variables; no external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and consistent with typical versioning patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables, including a version string and a tuple, based on hardcoded values. The TYPE_CHECKING conditional is standard for type hints, but does not influence runtime behavior. No data input, output, or malicious logic present. No obfuscation, external data fetching, or suspicious operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration for a package, with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It solely manages version info with hardcoded values, common in package setup files.",
