  "purpose": "Provides static version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples assigned directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; static assignments with no external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static data assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, external inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module with static variables. It contains no external data processing, network activity, or malicious logic. The use of type hints and conditional type checking is standard. All signals indicate benign, static metadata. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores of malware (0), obfuscated (0), and security risk (0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
