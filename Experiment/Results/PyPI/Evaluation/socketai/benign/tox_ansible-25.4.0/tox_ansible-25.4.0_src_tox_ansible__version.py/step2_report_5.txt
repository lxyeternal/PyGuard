  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a standard auto-generated version module created by setuptools-scm.\n   - It defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with hardcoded values.\n   - It includes a `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional for type hints, which is standard practice.\n   - There are no external inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n   - No obfuscation, credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The purpose is solely to provide version information.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and generated by a well-known build tool.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - No external data sources or untrusted inputs involved.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude benign nature, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified because the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - The reports do not identify any issues with the code logic or security.\n   - The only minor note is that the code is auto-generated and static, but this is not a flaw—just a characteristic.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign version declaration module.\n   - No modifications or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is typical for package versioning.",
