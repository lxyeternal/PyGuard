{
  "purpose": "The code provides pytest fixtures, environment setup, subprocess command execution, and configuration parsing for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables manipulated temporarily; subprocess commands constructed from controlled variables; configuration output parsed from subprocess stdout.",
  "sinks": "Parsed configuration data; environment variables modified for test setup; subprocess outputs used solely for configuration parsing.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable modifications and subprocess command execution; Sink: configuration parsing and environment cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; subprocess commands are constructed from known, controlled inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard testing fixtures and subprocess calls with controlled inputs. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. Environment variables are handled carefully, and subprocess outputs are used solely for configuration parsing. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as standard testing infrastructure with no malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.2), which is appropriate given the controlled environment and purpose.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
