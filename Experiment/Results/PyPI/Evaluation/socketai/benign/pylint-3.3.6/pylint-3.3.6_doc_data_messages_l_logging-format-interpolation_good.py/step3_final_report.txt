  "purpose": "The code logs the Python version using the logging module at error level.",

  "sinks": "logging.error",
  "flows": "sys.version -> logging.error",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and logging of environment info",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and logs the Python version at error level. It performs a benign operation for environment diagnostics without obfuscation or malicious payloads. No data exfiltration, external network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The logging of sys.version is minimal and generally safe, though it could reveal environment details. The code is simple, clear, and consistent with benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk stems from environment info logging, which is low risk. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a security risk around 0.1 are appropriate.",
