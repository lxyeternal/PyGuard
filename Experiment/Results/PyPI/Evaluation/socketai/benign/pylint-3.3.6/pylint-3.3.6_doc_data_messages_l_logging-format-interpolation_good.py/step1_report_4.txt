  "purpose": "Log the current Python version for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "sys.version (reads Python version information from the environment).",
  "sinks": "logging.error (outputs the version info to logs; no data exfiltration or external system interaction).",
  "flows": "sys.version → logging.error (safe logging of environment data).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed; simple logging statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and sys modules, then logs the current Python version at error level. The use of sys.version to retrieve environment information is standard and does not introduce security risks. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or data leaks. No input sources or data flows that could be exploited or lead to malicious activity are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign logging of the Python interpreter version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
