  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward logging of environment info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and sys modules, then logs the current Python version at error level. The purpose appears to be for debugging or environment reporting. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The code is simple and standard for logging environment info.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply logs the Python version and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and standard for environment diagnostics.",
