  "purpose": "Log the current Python interpreter version using the logging module.",
  "sources": "sys.version (reads system information about Python version)",

  "flows": "sys.version → logging.error",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward logging of environment info",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and sys modules, then logs the Python version at error level. This is a benign operation used for debugging or informational purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials or external network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to log the Python version. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
