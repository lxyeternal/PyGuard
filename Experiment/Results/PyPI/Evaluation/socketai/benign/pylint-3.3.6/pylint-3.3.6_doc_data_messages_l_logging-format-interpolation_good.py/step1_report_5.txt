  "purpose": "Log the current Python interpreter version for debugging or informational purposes",
  "sources": "sys.version (reads the Python runtime version information)",

  "flows": "sys.version → logging.error",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual behavior or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and sys modules, then logs the current Python version at the error level. This is a common debugging or informational statement with no malicious intent. It does not process untrusted input, modify files, or perform network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply logs the Python version information without any malicious or security-sensitive behavior. It is benign and typical for debugging or environment reporting purposes.",
