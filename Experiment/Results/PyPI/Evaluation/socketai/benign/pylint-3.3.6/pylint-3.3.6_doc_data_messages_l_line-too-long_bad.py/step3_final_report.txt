  "purpose": "Static list declaration of fruit names, with no dynamic behavior or external dependencies.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static list assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static data assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Comment about line-too-long; trailing comma after last element, both benign style issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static list of strings assigned to 'FRUIT'. It contains no input/output operations, external dependencies, or dynamic code. The only noted anomalies are style-related (line length comment and trailing comma), which are harmless in Python. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static list declaration with no security or malicious concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
