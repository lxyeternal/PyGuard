  "purpose": "Define a list of fruit names.",
  "sources": "The list literal assigned to the variable FRUIT.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Line is excessively long due to the list of fruit names; no malicious code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list of fruit names assigned to the variable FRUIT. The list contains multiple string entries, with one string ('dragon fruit') including a space, which is valid in Python string syntax. There are no input sources, data flows, or suspicious code constructs. The only noted issue is a line-too-long warning, likely from a linter, which does not indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a fruit list with no malicious intent or security concerns. The only issue is style-related (line length).",
