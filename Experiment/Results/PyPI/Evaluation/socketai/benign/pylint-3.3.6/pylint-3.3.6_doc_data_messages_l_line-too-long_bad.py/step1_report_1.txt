{
  "purpose": "Define a list of fruit names as a constant or data collection.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains a variable assignment with a static list.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code is purely a static declaration.",
  "anomalies": "There is a comment indicating a line-too-long warning, but this is not part of executable code. The list has an extra comma after the last element, which is syntactically valid in Python but can sometimes be suspicious in malicious contexts. However, in this context, it's benign.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a list of fruit strings to the variable FRUIT. The list appears to be a straightforward static data structure. There are no input/output operations, no external dependencies, and no suspicious patterns. The comment suggests a style warning, not malicious intent. Overall, the code is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static list declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
