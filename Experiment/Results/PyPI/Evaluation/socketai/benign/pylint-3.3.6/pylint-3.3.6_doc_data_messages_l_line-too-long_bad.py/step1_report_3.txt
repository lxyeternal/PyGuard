{
  "purpose": "Define a list of fruit names, likely for use in a larger program.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data leaks or external output points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no input/output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The list contains a trailing comma after the last element, which is syntactically acceptable in Python but can sometimes be misused in code obfuscation or version-specific issues. The comment indicates a line-too-long issue, but this is a style warning, not malicious. No other anomalies or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a list of fruit names to the variable FRUIT. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The presence of a comment about line length suggests style consideration rather than malicious intent. No obfuscation or malware signs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a straightforward data assignment of fruit names without any malicious or security-related issues.",
