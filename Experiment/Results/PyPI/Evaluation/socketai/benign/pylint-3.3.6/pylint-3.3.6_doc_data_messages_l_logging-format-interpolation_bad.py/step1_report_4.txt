  "purpose": "Log the current Python version using formatted string interpolation.",
  "sources": "sys.version (reads the Python interpreter's version information).",
  "sinks": "logging.error (outputs the message, which could be viewed in logs).",
  "flows": "sys.version -> logging.error (formats the string with version info, then logs it).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Uses standard libraries appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and sys modules, then logs an error message containing the current Python version via string formatting. The usage is straightforward and benign, aimed at diagnostic logging. No malicious code or suspicious data handling is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply logs the current Python version as an error message. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be standard diagnostic logging code.",
