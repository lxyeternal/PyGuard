  "purpose": "Log the current Python version using the logging module",
  "sources": "sys.version (reads system information about Python version)",
  "sinks": "logging.error (outputs the message to error logs or stderr)",
  "flows": "sys.version -> logging.error (the version string is passed as untrusted data to logging)",
  "anomalies": "None; the code performs a straightforward logging operation without hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and sys modules, then logs the Python interpreter version at the error level. The message construction uses string formatting, but since sys.version is a system attribute, it is considered trusted and static. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply logs the current Python version and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
