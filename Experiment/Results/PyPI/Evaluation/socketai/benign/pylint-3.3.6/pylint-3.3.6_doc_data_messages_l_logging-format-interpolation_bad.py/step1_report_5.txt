  "purpose": "Log the current Python version using the logging module.",
  "sources": "Reading the sys.version attribute to get Python version information.",
  "sinks": "Logging output that could potentially expose system environment details in logs.",
  "flows": "sys.version (source) -> logging.error (sink) to output version info.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses string formatting with the logging call, which can be vulnerable to format string issues if untrusted input is included, but here it's only logging sys.version, which is safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and sys modules, then logs the current Python version using a formatted string. There is no user input or untrusted data involved. The logging statement could potentially expose system environment details but does not perform malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply logs the Python version without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
