  "purpose": "Logs the current Python version using the logging module.",
  "sources": "sys.version (reads Python environment version information)",
  "sinks": "logging.error (outputs log message; does not directly leak data but could expose environment info if logs are exposed)",
  "flows": "sys.version -> logging.error",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting in logging.error instead of parameterized logging (not malicious but considered a best practice concern). No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging and sys modules, then logs the current Python version using an error level message with string formatting. There are no indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The logging of sys.version can potentially leak environment details if logs are publicly accessible, but this is a common debugging practice. No obfuscated code, no external network activity, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for logging the Python version. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond potential information disclosure if logs are exposed. Overall, safe but should be used with appropriate log access controls.",
