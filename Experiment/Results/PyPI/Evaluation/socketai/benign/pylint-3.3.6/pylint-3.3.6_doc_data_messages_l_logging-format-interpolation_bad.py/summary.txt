  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a diagnostic logging of the Python version. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The only minor concern is potential information leakage through logs, which is a typical trade-off in debugging scenarios. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to potential info disclosure if logs are exposed."
