  "flows": "sys.version → logging.error() with string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting in logging, but with trusted data (sys.version).",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and sys modules, then logs the Python version using logging.error() with string formatting. sys.version is a system attribute, not user input, so it does not pose injection risks. The logging output could potentially leak environment details if logs are exposed, but this is a common diagnostic practice. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of string formatting instead of parameterized logging is acceptable here due to trusted data, though best practices recommend parameterized logs. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to information disclosure if logs are accessible publicly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a diagnostic logging of the Python version. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The only minor concern is potential information leakage through logs, which is a typical trade-off in debugging scenarios. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to potential info disclosure if logs are exposed.",
