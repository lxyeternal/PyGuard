  "purpose": "The code defines a function to iterate over a list of spell names and print a message for each.",
  "sources": "The list 'spell_list' is a static, predefined list within the script.",
  "sinks": "The print statements output to standard output; no untrusted data or external sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static list 'spell_list' through the function 'wizard_spells' to the print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple iteration over a static list and prints each spell with a message. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data leaks. The pylint comment is a benign static analysis directive. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code lacks any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The data flow is simple and controlled, with no external dependencies or sensitive data involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
