  "purpose": "The code defines a function to iterate over a list of spells and prints a magical phrase for each spell.",
  "sources": "The input list 'spell_book' passed to the function 'wizard_spells'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs to standard output; no untrusted data flow or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'spell_list' to 'wizard_spells' function, then to 'print' output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the comment disables a pylint check but is benign. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply iterates over a list of spells and prints a message for each one. There are no data leaks, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The only notable aspect is the commented pylint directive, which does not impact security. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage is detected. The code appears to be purely illustrative or benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and harmless, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely prints predefined spell names with a message. No security issues or malware suspected.",
