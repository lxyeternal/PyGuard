  "purpose": "The function prints a list of wizard spells with a prefixed message.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'spell_book' passed to the 'wizard_spells' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input 'spell_book' flows into the loop and is used in the print statement, which outputs data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The comment disables a pylint check but does not affect behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that iterates over a list of spell names and prints each with a message. There are no data leaks, code injections, or external communications. The print statement is benign and only outputs to console. The comment disabling pylint is irrelevant to security but indicates some static analysis configuration. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prints spell names and does not perform any harmful or suspicious actions.",
