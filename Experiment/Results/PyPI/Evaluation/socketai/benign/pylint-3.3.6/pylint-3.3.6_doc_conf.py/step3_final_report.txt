  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, including path modifications, version info, and redirect mappings.",
  "sources": "sys.path modifications, import statements, static dictionaries (redirects), and module attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static configuration with no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for documentation purposes, involving standard imports, path adjustments, and static data structures. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The redirect dictionary and metadata are typical for documentation projects. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals are consistent with safe, straightforward setup code.",
