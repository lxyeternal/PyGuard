  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation.\n- No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No untrusted input sources or external data processing.\n- The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The redirect dictionary is typical for documentation navigation.\n- Import statements are safe, importing version info and standard modules.\n- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data.\n- No suspicious code patterns or behaviors.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: all reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: all assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable configuration code.\n- Risk score: all assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the script.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- None detected. The reasoning is sound, and the configuration appears safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no security concerns.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or code present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — static configuration with no security implications.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
