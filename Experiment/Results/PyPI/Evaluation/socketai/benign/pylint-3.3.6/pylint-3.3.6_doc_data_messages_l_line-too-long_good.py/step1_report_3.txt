  "purpose": "Define a list of fruit names for use in the program",
  "sources": "No input sources; data is hardcoded within the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no output or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple static list declaration",
  "analysis": "The code only declares a list variable named FRUIT containing a predefined set of fruit names as strings. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a static data definition with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It does not interact with external sources or perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static list of fruit names with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is benign and appears to serve as data for other parts of a program.",
