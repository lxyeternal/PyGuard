  "purpose": "Define a static list of fruit names for use as data within a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it solely defines a hardcoded list variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the list is static and used as a constant.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static list assignment with no dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious indicators. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. No issues or suspicious elements are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, representing a static list of fruit names with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
