  "purpose": "The function prints a list of wizard spells with a magical phrase.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'spell_book' which provides the list of spells.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs to the console; no untrusted data is written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'spell_book' into the loop and then to the print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that iterates over a provided list of spells and prints each spell with a fixed message. It uses a static list of spells defined as 'spell_list'. There is no user input processing, no external data fetching, no network activity, and no code injection or data leakage mechanisms. The function and data are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of printing a list of spells with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
