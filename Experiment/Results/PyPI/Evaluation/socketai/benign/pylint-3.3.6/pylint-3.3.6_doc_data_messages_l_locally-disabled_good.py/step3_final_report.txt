  "purpose": "Prints each spell from a provided list with a fixed message.",
  "sources": "The input list 'spell_book' provided to the function 'wizard_spells'.",

  "flows": "The function iterates over 'spell_book' (source) and outputs each spell via print (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that prints each spell in a list. The list is hardcoded and static. No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are involved. The code performs a benign display task with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility that prints a list of spells. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
