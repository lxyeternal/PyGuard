  "purpose": "Standard error handling pattern that executes a function, logs exceptions with their type and message, then re-raises the exception.",
  "sources": "The call to function() within the try block; exception object e in the except block.",
  "sinks": "logging.error() where exception type and message are recorded.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs in function(), flows to except block, logs exception details, then re-raises.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard try-except pattern used for error handling. It imports logging, executes function(), and logs any exception with its type and message before re-raising. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Logging exception info could potentially leak sensitive data if exceptions contain secrets, but this is a common practice. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard error handling pattern with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security concern about logging exception details is typical and does not constitute malicious intent. Scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.",
