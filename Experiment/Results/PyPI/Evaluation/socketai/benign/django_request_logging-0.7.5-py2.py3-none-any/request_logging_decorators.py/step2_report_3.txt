  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward decorator that sets attributes on functions to control logging behavior.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs, obfuscation, or external data processing are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be configuration management for logging, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code imports constants, uses nested helper functions, and performs simple attribute assignments.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The logic is transparent and standard for decorators that set configuration attributes.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- Risk score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n- No issues are identified that would warrant raising the risk score above 0.5.\n- The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is safe and typical for such use cases.\n\n**My conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard decorator for setting logging configuration attributes.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
