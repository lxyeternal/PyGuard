  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external calls.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies are detected.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The summaries are straightforward and align with the code snippet's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence` = 1\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also 0, reflecting no risk.\n   - Since the code is trivial and harmless, no higher scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No discrepancies or inconsistencies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippet is a standard version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes or corrections are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the code is harmless and serves only to specify the package version.",
