  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code snippet is minimal and standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified because the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely a version string assignment with no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs, there is no reason to assign a higher risk score. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score of 0 is correct; there is no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risks)\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code snippet is a standard version declaration with no security implications.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
