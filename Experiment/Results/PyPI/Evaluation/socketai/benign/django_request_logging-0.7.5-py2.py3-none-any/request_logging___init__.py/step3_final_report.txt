  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no dynamic or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard assignment of a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and transparency confirm the absence of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
