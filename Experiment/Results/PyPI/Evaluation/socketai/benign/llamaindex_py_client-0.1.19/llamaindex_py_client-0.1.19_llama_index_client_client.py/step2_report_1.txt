  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code sets up API clients with parameters like base_url and token, initializing resource-specific clients. Finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Recognizes token as a potential risk if misused but not insecurely handled here.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The token parameter could be a vector if misused externally, but within this code, it’s only passed as an argument. No issues found. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly cautious but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code initializes resource clients with provided parameters, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious activity. The lower security risk score reflects the lack of concerning issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is auto-generated, standard, with no obfuscated code or secrets. Highlights that tokens are handled via parameters, not stored insecurely.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward and typical for SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—initializes clients with parameters, no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, standard pattern.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also finds no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets. Recognizes the code as standard API client setup.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with the malware score of 0 across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the potential risk if tokens are mishandled externally, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated API client setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n- The token parameter's potential misuse is acknowledged, but within this code, it is only passed as an argument, not stored insecurely.\n\n- The security risk scores are reasonable, given the context.\n\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately set to 0.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, auto-generated SDK.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to token handling, but no actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, standard SDK setup, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
