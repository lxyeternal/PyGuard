  "purpose": "Auto-generated SDK setup code for API clients, initializing resource-specific clients with shared configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as base_url, token, timeout, and optional custom httpx clients used during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly transmitted or stored insecurely within this code.",
  "flows": "Parameters are passed into client wrapper constructors, which then initialize resource clients; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated setup for API resource clients, passing configuration parameters like base_url and token into client wrappers. It employs standard practices with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The token parameter's flexibility (string or callable) is typical for SDKs, and no secrets are hardcoded. The resource clients are instantiated with the shared wrapper, and no external or untrusted data is processed insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK initialization pattern with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned by the reports are appropriate. The main consideration is to ensure secure token management outside this code, but within this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
