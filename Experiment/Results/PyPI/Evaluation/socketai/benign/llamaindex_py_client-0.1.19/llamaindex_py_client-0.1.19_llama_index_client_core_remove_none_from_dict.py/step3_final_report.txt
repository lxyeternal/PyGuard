  "purpose": "Filter out None values from a dictionary, returning a new dictionary with only non-None entries.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'original' (a dictionary), iterated over in the for loop.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads from 'original' during iteration; outputs a new dictionary with filtered data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility function that iterates over the input dictionary, excluding entries where the value is None, and constructs a new dictionary. It uses standard Python constructs without external dependencies or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The logic is clear, and the implementation is correct. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the safe, non-malicious nature of the code. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
