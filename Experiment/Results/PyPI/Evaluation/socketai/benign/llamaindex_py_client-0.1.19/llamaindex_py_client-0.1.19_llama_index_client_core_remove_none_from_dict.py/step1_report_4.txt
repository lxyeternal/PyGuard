  "purpose": "Remove key-value pairs with None values from a dictionary",
  "sources": "Input dictionary parameter 'original'",
  "sinks": "Returns a new dictionary; no data sinks indicating potential leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Input 'original' -> function processing -> output 'new'",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual logic present; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The function iterates over the input dictionary and constructs a new dictionary excluding entries where the value is None. It uses type hints for clarity. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive operations are involved. The code is simple and appears benign. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation of filtering None values from a dictionary. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
