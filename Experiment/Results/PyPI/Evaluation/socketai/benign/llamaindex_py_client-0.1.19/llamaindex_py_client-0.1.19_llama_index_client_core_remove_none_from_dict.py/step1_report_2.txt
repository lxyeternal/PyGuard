  "flows": "Reads data from 'original', processes, and outputs a cleaned dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data filtering with no unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that iterates over a provided dictionary, filters out entries with None values, and returns a new dictionary. There are no external data inputs such as network or file I/O, no eval or exec calls, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a standard utility function for data cleaning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
