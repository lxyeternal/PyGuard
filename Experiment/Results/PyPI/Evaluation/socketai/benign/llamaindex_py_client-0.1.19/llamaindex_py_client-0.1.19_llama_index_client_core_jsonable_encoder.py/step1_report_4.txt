{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding Python objects into JSON-compatible formats, especially for use with FastAPI and Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters (`obj`, `custom_encoder`) and potentially from attributes of Pydantic models (`obj.dict()`, `obj.__config__`).",
  "sinks": "Data is transformed and returned directly, with no explicit external data leaks or system calls. No sensitive data is transmitted or stored outside the function scope.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through various type checks and encoders: from general Python objects to specific encoders, including Pydantic models and dataclasses, ultimately producing JSON-compatible data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code relies on standard library modules and well-known third-party libraries. The handling of Pydantic models, dataclasses, and enums is typical. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically encodes different Python object types into JSON-serializable formats, prioritizing type-specific encoding (e.g., Pydantic, dataclasses, Enums). It uses standard library features and the Pydantic library. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system tampering. The exception handling attempts to convert objects to dictionaries or vars, which is standard for serializing objects. No embedded or hidden malicious logic, backdoors, or code injection points are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for JSON encoding.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical JSON encoder utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard practices and libraries without introducing suspicious elements.",
