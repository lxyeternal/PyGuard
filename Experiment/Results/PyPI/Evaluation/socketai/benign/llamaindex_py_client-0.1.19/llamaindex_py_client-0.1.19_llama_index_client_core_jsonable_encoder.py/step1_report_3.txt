{
  "purpose": "To encode Python objects into JSON-compatible formats, primarily for FastAPI applications and Pydantic models.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function arguments (`obj`, `custom_encoder`), and data structures within objects such as dictionaries, lists, sets, dataclasses, and Pydantic models.",
  "sinks": "Returning encoded data, recursive calls to `jsonable_encoder`, and access to object attributes and methods (`dict()`, `vars()`, `__config__`, `dict`, `value`).",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through type checks and encodings; data from input sources flows through various transformation steps, potentially recursively, to produce JSON-compatible output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Usage of try-except for exception handling appears standard. Dynamic imports of `pydantic` are conditional, but they are for compatibility and not suspicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious string operations are present. The code handles various data types safely.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type checking and data conversion, including support for Pydantic models, dataclasses, Enums, and standard Python collections. The import logic for `pydantic` is version-dependent but intended for compatibility. Recursive encoding is implemented carefully, and there are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious side-effects. The exception handling around `dict()` and `vars()` is standard and does not involve untrusted input manipulation. No suspicious network operations, file system access, or credential handling is present. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured data encoder with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard JSON encoder tailored for FastAPI and Pydantic, with appropriate data handling and recursive encoding. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. It functions as intended for data serialization, with no security risks identified.",
