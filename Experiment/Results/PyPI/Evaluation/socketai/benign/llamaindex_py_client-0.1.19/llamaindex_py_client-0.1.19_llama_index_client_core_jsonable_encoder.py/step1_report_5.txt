{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to encode Python objects into JSON-compatible formats, mainly for use in FastAPI applications to serialize data models and other objects.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (obj, custom_encoder), and from imported modules and class attributes such as pydantic.json.ENCODERS_BY_TYPE and obj.__config__.",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded JSON-compatible data; no direct untrusted data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters and module attributes through various encoding logic, ending with the output of JSON-compatible data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Usage of dynamic type checking and recursion is standard for serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard serialization tasks: converting pydantic models, dataclasses, enums, datetime objects, and collections into JSON-compatible formats. It imports pydantic with version checking, uses custom encoders, and recursively encodes nested structures. No malicious patterns or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or external network calls are evident. The code's dynamic type handling and recursion are typical for serialization libraries and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical data serialization utility for FastAPI, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard library features and external dependencies responsibly, without hidden network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
