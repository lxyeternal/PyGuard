  "purpose": "Define a specific API error class for HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity responses",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (`..core.api_error` and `..types.http_validation_error`)",
  "sinks": "Super constructor call which passes `body` parameter; no untrusted data sinks or external network operations",
  "flows": "Instantiation of `UnprocessableEntityError` with a `body` argument flows into the superclass constructor, but no untrusted data processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed; the code is straightforward and auto-generated",
  "analysis": "The code imports error classes and defines a subclass representing a specific HTTP error. The class constructor forwards its parameters to the parent class. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious behaviors such as network connections or system modifications. It appears to be a standard auto-generated API error class with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated class for handling a specific API error. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
