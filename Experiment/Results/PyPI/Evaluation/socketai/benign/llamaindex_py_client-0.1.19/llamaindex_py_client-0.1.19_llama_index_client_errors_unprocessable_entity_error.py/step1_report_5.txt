  "purpose": "Define a custom error class for handling HTTP 422 validation errors in an API client or server.",
  "sources": "Import statements for ApiError and HttpValidationError classes.",
  "sinks": "Constructor call to super().__init__, which may handle error data.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of UnprocessableEntityError with a HttpValidationError object, passing it to the superclass.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward subclass of ApiError, used for representing HTTP 422 validation errors. It imports necessary types and correctly passes data to the superclass. The structure is typical for error handling classes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. No external data handling, network operations, or sensitive info are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a custom API error class. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
