  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, auto-generated custom error class inheriting from `ApiError`.\n- The code imports necessary modules, defines a class with a constructor passing parameters to the parent class, and does not perform any external data handling, network operations, or suspicious activities.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are observed across all reports.\n- The reported purpose, sources, sinks, and flows are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the class purpose and import sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes data flows; the constructor passes `body` to parent.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states it's a safe, auto-generated error class.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `confidence=0.9`. These seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, with a confidence of 1, which is justified.\n- No issues identified.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar reasoning; confirms the code is standard.\n- Confidence slightly lower (0.9), which is reasonable but could be increased to 1 given the clarity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same conclusions; the code is standard and safe.\n- Confidence at 1, which is justified.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- Again, confirms the code's benign nature.\n- Confidence at 1, appropriate.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate considering the code is a simple error class with no security implications.\n\n**However, considering the overall context:**\n- The code is auto-generated, standard, and contains no suspicious activity.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are correct in their assessment. The code is a safe, standard implementation of an API error class with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
