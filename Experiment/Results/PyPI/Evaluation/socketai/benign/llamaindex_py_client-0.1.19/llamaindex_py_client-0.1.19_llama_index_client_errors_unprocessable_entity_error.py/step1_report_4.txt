  "purpose": "Define a custom error class for handling 422 Unprocessable Entity errors in an API.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: '..core.api_error' and '..types.http_validation_error'. No external data sources or user input are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the class only constructs an error object with a status code and body.",
  "flows": "The class initializes with a body parameter of type HttpValidationError, passing it along with a fixed status code to the superclass.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard error class design.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ApiError to represent specific validation errors. It imports types and a base error class, then initializes with a body parameter. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be auto-generated, but that does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error class definition for API validation errors, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
