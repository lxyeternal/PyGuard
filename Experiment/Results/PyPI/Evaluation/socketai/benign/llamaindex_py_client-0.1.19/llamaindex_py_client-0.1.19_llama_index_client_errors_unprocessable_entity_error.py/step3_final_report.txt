  "purpose": "Defines a custom API error class for HTTP 422 validation errors, inheriting from ApiError and encapsulating an HttpValidationError body.",
  "sources": "Imports from ..core.api_error and ..types.http_validation_error; constructor receives body parameter.",
  "sinks": "Constructor passes status_code and body to parent; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'body' flows into parent constructor via super().__init__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated class extending ApiError, passing a fixed status code and a body object. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is to represent a specific HTTP error, with no external data leaks or malicious behavior. All signals indicate benign, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API error class with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk being appropriate.",
