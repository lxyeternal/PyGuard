  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a simple custom error class `UnprocessableEntityError` inheriting from `ApiError`.\n- The code imports `ApiError` and `HttpValidationError`, then defines a constructor that passes a fixed status code (422) and the body to the parent class.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is detected across all reports.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated, standard for API error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Review:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code matches the description in all reports; no issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Malicious code:** None detected. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code is straightforward and correctly implemented.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points on scoring:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. Slightly higher scores (e.g., 0.1) could be justified if considering auto-generated code, but 0 remains reasonable.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions; the analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, safe, auto-generated API error class with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code review.",
