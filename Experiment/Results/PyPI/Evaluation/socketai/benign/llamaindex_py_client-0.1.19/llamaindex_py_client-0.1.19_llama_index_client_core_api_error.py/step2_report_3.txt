  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a class `ApiError` extending `Exception`.\n- Has optional attributes `status_code` and `body`.\n- Constructor assigns these attributes.\n- `__str__` method formats these attributes into a string.\n- No external data sources, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1-5 common points:**\n- Purpose: All correctly identify that the class is a straightforward custom exception for API error handling.\n- Sources & sinks: They correctly note that the constructor parameters are assigned to attributes, and `__str__` uses these attributes for output.\n- Anomalies: All reports agree that no hardcoded secrets, unusual patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- Analysis & conclusion: All consider the code benign, standard, and safe, with no malware or security risks.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n- All assign malware and securityRisk scores as 0.\n- Obfuscated score is 0 in all cases.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code matches the description and purpose. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as standard and benign.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.  \n  Security risk is also 0, consistent with the benign analysis.  \n  Obfuscated is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Potential for higher scores?**  \n  No, since the code is purely a data container with no side effects, no external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code is very minimal, typical for an API client error class.\n- No external dependencies or behaviors that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- The string output is harmless, merely formatting internal data.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe implementation of an exception class with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the detailed analysis provided.",
