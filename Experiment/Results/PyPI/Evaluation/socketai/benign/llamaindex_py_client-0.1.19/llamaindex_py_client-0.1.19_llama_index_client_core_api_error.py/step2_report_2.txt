  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code defines a simple custom exception class `ApiError` with optional attributes `status_code` and `body`. The constructor assigns these attributes, and the `__str__` method formats them into a string. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and intended for error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, benign exception class.\n- They note no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The reasoning is sound: the class only stores and formats data, with no external data sources or side effects.\n- The confidence score is 1, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, aligning with the assessment that there's no malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code matches the description perfectly. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The scores are all 1 for confidence, 0 for malware, and 0 for security risk, which are appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. The code is purely for error handling with no side effects or external data processing.\n\n- **Malware considerations:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly conclude the code is safe.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2  \n  Slightly above zero if considering the potential for misuse of exception data, but given the benign nature, 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated exception class with no security issues or malware. The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nand acknowledge that the code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
