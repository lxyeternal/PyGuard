  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and evaluate the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same class `ApiError`, which is a straightforward custom exception with optional `status_code` and `body`.\n- The code is simple, auto-generated, and contains no external data sources, network calls, or obfuscation.\n- No malicious behavior, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The `__str__` method outputs the internal attributes, which could include untrusted data, but this is standard for error messages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description perfectly.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code.\n\n### Errors or flaws:\n- No errors or flaws are detected in the logic or reasoning.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The **malware score** is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, since no vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a benign, auto-generated exception class with no malicious intent, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The outputs (string formatting) are standard and do not pose security risks unless untrusted data is used directly elsewhere, but that is outside this code's scope.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only potential concern is the `__str__` method exposing internal data, but this is typical for error messages and not a security vulnerability per se.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign exception class with no security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
