  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for API error handling with optional status code and response body attributes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the __init__ method: status_code and body.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method constructs a string representation that includes status_code and body.",
  "flows": "The __init__ method assigns input parameters to instance variables; __str__ uses these variables to generate output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious imports or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard custom exception class extending Exception, with optional attributes for status code and response body. The __init__ method allows setting these attributes, and __str__ formats them into a string. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling, and no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues. The code appears straightforward and typical for error handling in API clients or servers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of an exception class with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
