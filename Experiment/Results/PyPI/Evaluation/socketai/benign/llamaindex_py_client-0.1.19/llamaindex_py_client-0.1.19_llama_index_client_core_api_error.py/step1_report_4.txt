{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling API errors with optional status code and response body.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) and class variables (status_code, body). No external input sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method outputs the error details as a string, which could be used for logging or display, but does not leak untrusted data by itself.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the class only stores data provided during instantiation and formats it for string output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code appears straightforward and standard for an exception class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class 'ApiError' with optional fields for status code and body, intended for API error handling. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or complex logic. The __str__ method formats internal data into a string, which is typical. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code injection, or privacy leaks. The code is minimal, clean, and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a custom exception class. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
