{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class ApiError for handling API-related errors with optional status code and body information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameters passed to __init__ and the optional class variables, and constructs a string in __str__ method.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method outputs a formatted string containing potentially untrusted data (status_code and body).",
  "flows": "Input parameters (status_code, body) flow into class attributes, then into the __str__ method for string output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated features detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard exception class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with optional attributes, initialized via constructor parameters. The __str__ method formats these attributes into a string. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The class is straightforward and used for error handling. No signs of malicious activity or security issues are evident. The potential risk is minimal, as it only formats and outputs provided data without any side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a custom exception class for API errors. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
