  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a straightforward custom exception class `ApiError` with optional `status_code` and `body` attributes, and a `__str__` method that formats these attributes into a string.\n- The code is simple, auto-generated, and does not perform any network operations, dynamic code execution, or data processing beyond storing and formatting provided parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious imports are present.\n- The `malware` score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The `securityRisk` score is also 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only potential concern is that the `__str__` method outputs internal attributes directly, which could include untrusted data (`body`). However, this is standard for exception classes and does not imply malicious intent.\n- There are no claims or evidence of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score evaluations:**\n- The `malware` score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- The `obfuscated` score of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe for use.\n- No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code behavior.\n\n**Final note:** The reports correctly identify that this code is a typical, benign exception class with no security issues or malicious intent.",
