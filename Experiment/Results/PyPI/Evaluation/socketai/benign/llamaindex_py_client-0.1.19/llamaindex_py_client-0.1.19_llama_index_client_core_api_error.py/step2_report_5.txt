  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the analysis provided.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code is a straightforward Python class defining an exception with optional `status_code` and `body` attributes, and a `__str__` method.  \n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no external data sources, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation.  \n   - The code appears benign and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n   - They correctly state that the code is standard, with no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent.  \n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, and scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all 0.  \n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic execution.  \n   - The only potential concern could be if the string representation (`__str__`) leaks untrusted data, but in this context, it merely formats stored attributes.  \n   - Since the attributes are set during instantiation and not from external untrusted sources within this code snippet, the risk is minimal.  \n   - Therefore, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - No malicious behavior is detected or suggested.  \n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that the code is auto-generated, standard, and safe.  \n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.  \n   - The scores align with the analysis and the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a simple, auto-generated exception class with no malicious intent, no external data handling beyond constructor parameters, and no suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the provided assessments. The code is benign, and the scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
