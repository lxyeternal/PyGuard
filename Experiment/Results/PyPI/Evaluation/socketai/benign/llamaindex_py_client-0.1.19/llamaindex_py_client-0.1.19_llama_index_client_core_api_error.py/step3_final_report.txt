{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'ApiError' with optional 'status_code' and 'body' attributes, used for API error handling.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters 'status_code' and 'body' assigned to instance attributes; '__str__' method accesses these attributes for string output.",
  "sinks": "The '__str__' method outputs internal attributes which could include untrusted data, but this is standard for exceptions and does not pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "Attributes 'status_code' and 'body' are set during instantiation and accessed in '__str__' for formatting; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard custom exception class with optional attributes. It does not perform any network operations, data processing beyond storing parameters, or obfuscation. The '__str__' method outputs stored attributes, which is typical for exceptions. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero. The code's benign nature and simplicity are consistent across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated exception class with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
