{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling API errors with optional status code and body.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) which accepts status_code and body as optional parameters.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method which formats the exception message for display or logging.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (status_code, body) from instantiation to storage, then to string representation for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic code execution detected. The class is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class inheriting from Exception, with optional attributes for status code and body. The constructor assigns provided values, and the __str__ method formats these attributes into a string. There are no external data sources, no use of untrusted input beyond standard object instantiation, and no suspicious behaviors such as network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration. The implementation appears typical for error handling in API client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe exception class for API error handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
