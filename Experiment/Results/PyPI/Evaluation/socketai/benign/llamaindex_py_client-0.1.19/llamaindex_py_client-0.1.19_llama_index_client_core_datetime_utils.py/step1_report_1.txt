  "purpose": "Serialize a datetime object into an ISO 8601 string with timezone information, converting UTC times to 'Z' notation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'v' of type dt.datetime, and internally calling dt.datetime.now().astimezone() to get local timezone info.",
  "sinks": "Returns a formatted string representing the datetime, including potential side effects of calling now().astimezone(), but no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input datetime 'v' is processed and potentially replaced with a localized version if no timezone info is present, then formatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The use of datetime and timezone functions is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is to serialize datetime objects with timezone info. It correctly handles UTC with 'Z' notation and local timezones. The only notable behavior is calling datetime.now().astimezone() to obtain local timezone info when none is provided, which is standard practice. No external data or inputs are involved that could lead to malicious exploits. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard and safe serialization of datetime objects. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation for datetime serialization with proper timezone handling.",
