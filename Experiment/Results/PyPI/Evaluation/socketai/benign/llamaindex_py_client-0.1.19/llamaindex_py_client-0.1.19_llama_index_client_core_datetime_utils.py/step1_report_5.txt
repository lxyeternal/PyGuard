  "purpose": "Serialize datetime objects to string format with timezone information, handling UTC and local timezones appropriately.",
  "sources": "Reads datetime object input 'v'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; operates purely on input data.",
  "flows": "Input datetime 'v' flows through timezone checks and formatting functions, with no external data or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The use of local timezone determination is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts a datetime object and serializes it into ISO format with timezone info. It correctly identifies UTC datetimes and appends 'Z', while converting other timezones to offset format. If the datetime lacks tzinfo, it localizes it to the current system timezone. The code uses standard library functions with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or code injection. The logic is straightforward and serves a common serialization purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard datetime serialization utility with no malicious intent, no suspicious anomalies, and no security issues identified. It is safe and performs expected formatting tasks.",
