  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function to serialize datetime objects into ISO 8601 string representations, including timezone information.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameter 'v' of type dt.datetime and retrieves current local timezone via dt.datetime.now().astimezone().tzinfo.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'v.isoformat()' for output; the only potential concern is the use of 'dt.datetime.now().astimezone()' which depends on system timezone, but this is standard and not malicious.",
  "flows": "Input datetime 'v' is checked for timezone info, potentially localized using current system timezone, then serialized to ISO format with timezone info included.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The use of local timezone retrieval and datetime serialization is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely serializes datetime objects, correctly handling UTC and non-UTC timezones, and local timezone localization when no timezone info is present. The functions and logic are straightforward, standard, and do not perform any harmful operations or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for datetime serialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs its purpose without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
