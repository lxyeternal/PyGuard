  "purpose": "Serialize a datetime object into an ISO 8601 string with timezone information, handling UTC specially.",
  "sources": "Input is the datetime object `v` provided to the function `serialize_datetime`.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a formatted string; no untrusted data flows to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input datetime `v` flows through timezone checks and formatting functions, with no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard datetime formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to serialize datetime objects, handling timezone-aware and naive datetimes. It converts naive datetimes to local timezone before formatting. The code uses standard library functions with no external calls, network operations, or data leaks. There are no suspicious code structures or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward and consistent with typical datetime serialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard datetime serialization function with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs normal operations to format datetime objects into strings, respecting timezone information.",
