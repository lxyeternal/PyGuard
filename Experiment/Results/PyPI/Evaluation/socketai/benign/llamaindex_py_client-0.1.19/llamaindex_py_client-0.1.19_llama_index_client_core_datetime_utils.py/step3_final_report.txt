  "purpose": "Serialize a datetime object into an ISO 8601 string, handling UTC with 'Z' notation and local timezone for naive datetimes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter v (datetime object), system's current timezone via datetime.now().astimezone().tzinfo",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or handle untrusted data sources",
  "flows": "Input datetime v -> check tzinfo -> if naive, localize with system timezone -> serialize with isoformat() -> output string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard library functions used, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward datetime serialization utility. It correctly handles timezone-aware and naive datetimes, converting UTC to 'Z' and localizing naive datetimes to the system timezone. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The logic is clear, using standard library functions without external dependencies or side effects. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for datetime serialization with proper timezone handling. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reported scores are justified and accurate.",
