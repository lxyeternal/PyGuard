{
  "purpose": "The code imports an error class from a local module and defines the public API exports for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .unprocessable_entity_error import UnprocessableEntityError",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects; only defining exports",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import is static and local",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple module with import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a class from a local module and exposing it in __all__ for public use. It appears to be auto-generated by Fern, likely from an API definition. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py or module declaration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a package's interface. There are no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation.",
