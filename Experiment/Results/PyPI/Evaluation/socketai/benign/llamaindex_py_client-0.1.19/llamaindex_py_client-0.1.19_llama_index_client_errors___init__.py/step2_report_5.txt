  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is minimal: it imports a class from a local module and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- All reports agree that the code is auto-generated, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no external network interactions.\n- All scores assigned are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is very simple: an import statement and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n- The reports' summaries and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware=0\n  - obfuscated=0\n  - securityRisk=0\n- These are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all reports and the code indicate no malicious activity, scores should remain at 0.\n- Any higher score would be unjustified and inconsistent with the evidence.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports mention auto-generation but clarify that it is standard and not suspicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on code content.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, auto-generated module that exports an error class. No security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The code is safe and poses no security risk.",
