  "purpose": "This module exports the 'UnprocessableEntityError' class, likely used for handling specific API errors related to unprocessable entities.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'UnprocessableEntityError' from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only imports a class and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The file is auto-generated, as indicated by the comment, which is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a local module and defines an export list. It contains no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file system interactions. The comment indicates automated generation, which is standard for API clients or SDKs. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated module exporting an error class. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
