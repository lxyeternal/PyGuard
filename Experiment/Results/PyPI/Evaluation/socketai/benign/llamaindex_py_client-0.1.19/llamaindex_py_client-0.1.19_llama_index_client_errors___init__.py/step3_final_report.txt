  "purpose": "A minimal module exporting an error class, auto-generated for API error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module './unprocessable_entity_error'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import of class to export via __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no dynamic code execution, network interactions, or obfuscation. It is a simple, auto-generated module typical for API error handling. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
