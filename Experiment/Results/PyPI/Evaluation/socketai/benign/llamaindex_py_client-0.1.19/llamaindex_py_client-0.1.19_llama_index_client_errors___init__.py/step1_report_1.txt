{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module that imports and exposes a single class UnprocessableEntityError, likely for error handling in an API.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.unprocessable_entity_error' during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets up an import and an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of an import statement and an __all__ declaration. It appears to be an auto-generated module that re-exports an error class. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated module used for organizing exports in an API package. It does not contain any malicious code or security issues.",
