{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to re-export a specific exception class 'UnprocessableEntityError' from a module, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'UnprocessableEntityError' from a local module '.unprocessable_entity_error'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential points where untrusted data could cause security issues are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual constructs or obfuscation. It is auto-generated but that does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a local module and exposing it via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leaks, code injection, or external communications. The auto-generation comment suggests standard code generation practices. No secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, standard module export code with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
