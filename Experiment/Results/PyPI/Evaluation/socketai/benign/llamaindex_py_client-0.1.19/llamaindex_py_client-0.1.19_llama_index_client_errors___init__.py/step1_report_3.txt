  "purpose": "Defines an API error class and exports it for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and exports a class",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and does not contain suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'UnprocessableEntityError' from a relative module and makes it available for external modules via __all__. It is auto-generated and contains no dynamic code, external network interactions, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, auto-generated module for exporting an error class. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
