  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple module importing a class from a local module and exposing it via `__all__`.\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform dynamic execution, or contain any obfuscation.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, code injection, or secret leaks, are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are 0 for malware and security risk.\n   - Since the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or risky behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity or indicators are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The analysis is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code's simplicity, auto-generated nature, and the absence of any suspicious activity, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is benign and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, auto-generated module for exporting an error class.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI recommend maintaining the current scores. The code is safe, with no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
