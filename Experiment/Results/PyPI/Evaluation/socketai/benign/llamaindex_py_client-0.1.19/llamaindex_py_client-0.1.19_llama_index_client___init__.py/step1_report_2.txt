{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an export module for various classes, functions, and resources related to a Python SDK or package, primarily for data ingestion, processing, and API interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and resources, particularly from local package files (.types, .errors, .resources). It does not read untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code exports numerous classes and functions, but no sinks are explicitly performing unsafe operations like executing untrusted code, writing to system files, or sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code. It is primarily an import/export declaration and list of symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization with an __all__ list, importing, and exporting symbols. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. It does not contain dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initialization pattern, importing from submodules and defining an __all__ list for exports. It contains no runtime logic, user input handling, or network operations. Its purpose is to organize and expose components of a larger package. No malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or sabotage mechanisms, is evident. The structure is clear and typical for a Python package index file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package symbol declaration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
