  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details and scores provided.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, importing and exporting modules without any suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n  The confidence is high (0.9), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Similar to Report 1, it's a standard module initialization.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n  The confidence is even higher (1), which is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Again, standard import/export setup.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n  Confidence is 1, appropriate for the benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Same pattern—standard module aggregator.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n  Confidence is 1, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  None.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n  Confidence is 1, fitting the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are appropriately zero.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are zero, matching the straightforward, auto-generated nature.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, all are correctly set to 0.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate in their assessments.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code is a standard, benign module setup with no security concerns.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
