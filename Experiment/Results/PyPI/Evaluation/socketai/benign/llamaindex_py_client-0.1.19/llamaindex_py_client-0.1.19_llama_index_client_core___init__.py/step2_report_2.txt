  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as an auto-generated, standard Python module that imports local utility classes/functions and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as an API or package initializer.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code does not contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n- It is a typical pattern for Python package modules, especially `__init__.py` files.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The reports' high confidence scores (mostly 0.9 to 1) are justified.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Risks and Malware Score:**\n- Since the code is purely structural, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score is also correctly 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform any network or file operations.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, auto-generated module that simply manages imports and exports for a package.\n- There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk present.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
