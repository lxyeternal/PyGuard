{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or aggregator, importing various utility classes and functions from local modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports local modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports local modules and exports their references; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated module that imports local utility classes/functions and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign, structural nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated module primarily used for organizing exports in a Python package. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are accurate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
