  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the correctness of their conclusions, the scoring, and any potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, importing local modules and exporting them via `__all__`. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, standard module scaffolding.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard package initialization with no external data handling or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, a typical auto-generated import module with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous reports, standard package setup with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical auto-generated module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, benign module that imports and exports classes/functions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are appropriately set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n- The structure is typical for auto-generated package modules, often used for organizing exports.\n- No signs of security vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, safe module with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
