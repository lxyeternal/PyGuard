{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an auto-generated module exporting several utility classes and functions related to API handling, date-time serialization, JSON encoding, and dictionary cleaning.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .api_error, .client_wrapper, .datetime_utils, .jsonable_encoder, .remove_none_from_dict",
  "sinks": "Exports all imported classes and functions for external use",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules -> exports the same entities as module interface",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard module scaffolding.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several utility components from local modules, likely part of a larger package. It then exports these components via __all__ for external use. There are no input reading sources such as network, files, or environment variables. No sinks like network transmission or system modifications are evident. The code structure is typical for an auto-generated Python package module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or anomalous behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module that exports various classes and functions, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, standard codebase.",
