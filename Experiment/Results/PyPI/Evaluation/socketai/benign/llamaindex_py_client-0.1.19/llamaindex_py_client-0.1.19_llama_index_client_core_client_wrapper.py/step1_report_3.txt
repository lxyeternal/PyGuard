  "purpose": "Define HTTP client wrappers for synchronous and asynchronous API communication with token-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Token value provided during initialization, which can be a string or a callable returning a string.",
  "sinks": "Usage of the token in HTTP headers for authorization.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the client with token -> get_headers() retrieves token -> token is included in headers for API requests.",
  "anomalies": "The token can be provided as a callable, allowing dynamic token retrieval. No malicious or suspicious code observed; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for HTTP client wrappers, supporting token-based authentication. The token can be a static string or a function that returns a string, which is handled safely. The token is used solely for setting headers. No input/output operations or data leaks are evident. No suspicious code behavior, backdoors, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of API client wrappers with flexible token handling. No signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be safe and intended for normal use.",
