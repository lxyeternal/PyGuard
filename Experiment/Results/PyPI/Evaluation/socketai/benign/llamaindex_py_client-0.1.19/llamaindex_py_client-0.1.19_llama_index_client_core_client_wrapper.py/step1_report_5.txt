{
  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes for HTTP clients to facilitate authenticated requests with configurable base URLs.",
  "sources": "Token input (possibly user-provided) in the constructor; class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Usage of token in HTTP headers for authentication; potential use of the token in network requests.",
  "flows": "Token input -> get_headers() -> Authorization header in HTTP request.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; token handling is standard, allowing dynamic token retrieval via callable.",
  "analysis": "The code creates classes to wrap around httpx.Client and httpx.AsyncClient, managing authorization headers through tokens that can be static strings or callables. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices are evident. The token is used in headers for authenticated requests, which is standard. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network behaviors. The code does not perform any file operations, system modifications, or external communications outside HTTP requests. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of client wrappers for making authenticated HTTP requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
