  "purpose": "Provides a simple API client wrapper with token-based authentication, supporting both sync and async HTTP clients.",
  "sources": "The token parameter, which can be a string or a callable returning a string.",
  "sinks": "The get_headers method constructs headers including the Authorization header with the token.",
  "flows": "The token is retrieved via _get_token() and used in get_headers() to set the Authorization header.",
  "anomalies": "The token can be a callable, which could be malicious if it leaks data or executes harmful code, but this pattern is common for dynamic token retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of API client wrappers. It handles tokens flexibly, allowing callables, which could be misused externally but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The token handling via callables introduces a potential risk if misused, but within this code, it is a standard pattern. No signs of network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard API client wrapper with flexible token handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The use of callables for tokens is a common pattern and does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
