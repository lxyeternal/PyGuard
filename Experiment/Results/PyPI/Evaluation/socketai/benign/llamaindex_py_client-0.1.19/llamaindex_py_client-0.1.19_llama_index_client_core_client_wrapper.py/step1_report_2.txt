{
  "purpose": "Define wrapper classes for synchronous and asynchronous HTTP clients that include token-based authorization headers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the token parameter provided during class instantiation, which can be a string or a callable returning a string.",
  "sinks": "The token value is used in constructing the Authorization header; potential leaks could occur if token is mishandled outside or printed, but within this code, the token is used internally.",
  "flows": "Token (source) flows into get_headers() method where it is inserted into the Authorization header (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears standard for an API client wrapper, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines base and derived classes for HTTP client wrappers with token handling. The token can be a string or a callable, providing flexibility. The token is used solely for setting authorization headers. No data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and follows typical patterns for API client wrappers. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of HTTP client wrappers with token-based authentication. No signs of malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks were identified.",
