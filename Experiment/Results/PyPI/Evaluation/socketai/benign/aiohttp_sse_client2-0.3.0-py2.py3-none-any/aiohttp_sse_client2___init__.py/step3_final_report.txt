{
  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata, defining author, email, version, and encoding for a Python package.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only static metadata variables and a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static metadata variables are assigned without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static package metadata file with no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. It contains only metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) and a UTF-8 encoding declaration. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code. Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
