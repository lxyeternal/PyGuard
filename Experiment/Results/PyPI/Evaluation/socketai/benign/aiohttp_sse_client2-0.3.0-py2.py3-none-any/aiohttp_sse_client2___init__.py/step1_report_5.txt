{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the top-level package declaration and metadata for the 'SSE Client' Python package.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__author__, __email__, __version__); no external data sources read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data handling, input, or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present; code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual functional code; only metadata definitions and encoding declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a file encoding declaration, a docstring describing the package, and metadata variables for author, email, and version. No logic, data input, or output operations are present. This is a standard package initialization file (likely __init__.py). There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors. The absence of executable code or data handling indicates minimal security concern from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It provides versioning and authorship info without any suspicious elements.",
