{
  "purpose": "This code defines metadata for a Python package named 'SSE Client'.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the static metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists since the code only contains metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only package metadata. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the UTF-8 encoding declaration, specifies package metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__), and contains only comments. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external communications, or suspicious behavior. The file appears to be a standard __init__.py or package metadata file without any executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple package metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is standard boilerplate for Python packages.",
