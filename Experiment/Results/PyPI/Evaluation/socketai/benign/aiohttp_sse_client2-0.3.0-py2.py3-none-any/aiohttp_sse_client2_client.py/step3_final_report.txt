{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous Server-Sent Events (SSE) client using aiohttp, managing connection, reconnection, event parsing, and dispatching.",
  "sources": "URL parameter for the server endpoint, headers (including Last-Event-Id), and response content stream.",
  "sinks": "Event data and type are processed internally; no external untrusted data sinks are evident, but the code handles incoming network data which could be malicious if the server is compromised.",
  "flows": "Input URL and headers → HTTP request → response stream → line parsing → event dispatching → event handler callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual network activity detected. Reconnection logic uses exponential backoff, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SSE client. It manages connection states, headers, and event parsing correctly. No malicious routines, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The reconnection logic employs exponential backoff, and error handling is appropriate. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network domains are observed. The code's clarity and adherence to best practices suggest a benign and secure implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SSE client with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
