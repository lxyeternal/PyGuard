{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous Server-Sent Events (SSE) client to connect to a streaming source, process incoming events, and handle reconnections.",
  "sources": "Reads input from network responses, particularly the HTTP response stream, and configuration options such as URL and request headers.",
  "sinks": "Processes network responses and updates internal state; no untrusted data is written or transmitted without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network response stream into internal event parsing logic, with no evidence of untrusted data affecting critical operations beyond expected network processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of standard libraries and typical network handling patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an asynchronous SSE client, manages HTTP connection and reconnection logic, and processes incoming event streams. It handles network errors with retries, manages connection states, and processes event data in accordance with standard SSE protocols. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client with standard features, error handling, and reconnection strategies.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard SSE client library, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It responsibly manages network connections, processes event streams, and handles errors. No indicators of malicious or privacy-invasive behavior are detected.",
