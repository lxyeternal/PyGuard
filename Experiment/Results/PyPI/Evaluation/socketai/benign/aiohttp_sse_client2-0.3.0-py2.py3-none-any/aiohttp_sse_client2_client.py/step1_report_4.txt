{
  "purpose": "The code implements an asynchronous Server-Sent Events (SSE) client that connects to a specified URL and processes incoming events.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters (URL, headers, method, event handlers) from constructor arguments; reads response data from HTTP response stream; reads environment variables indirectly via headers and URL.",
  "sinks": "Uses the aiohttp request method to establish network connection; processes incoming server data and dispatches events; logs error messages; potential injection points include request parameters and headers.",
  "flows": "Constructs HTTP request with headers; performs network request; processes server response; reads and decodes event data; dispatches events to handlers; reconnects upon failure with exponential backoff.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads observed.\nUses exponential backoff for retries, which is standard.\nNo suspicious domain or IP addresses hardcoded.\nNo dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.\nEvent data and headers appear to follow standard SSE protocol.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an async SSE client using aiohttp. It manages connection states, handles reconnections with exponential backoff, processes server-sent events, and dispatches them via callbacks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network behaviors are evident. The request headers correctly include 'Accept' and 'Cache-Control'. It correctly manages session lifecycle and response reading. Event data processing and error handling are implemented normally.\nThere are no indications of data leakage, privacy violations, or malicious activity.\nAll external interactions appear limited to legitimate network requests and event processing.\nNo obfuscated or suspicious code segments were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client with no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It follows standard practices for network communication and event handling. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
