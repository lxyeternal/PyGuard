  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of an SSE client.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are identified.\n- The code employs typical patterns like exponential backoff, proper header management, and event parsing.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n  All reports agree that no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code handles network requests, event parsing, and reconnection logic as expected.\n\n- **Code Logic & Security Flaws:**  \n  No logical flaws or security issues are identified. The code manages connection states, headers, and event dispatching correctly.\n\n- **Use of External Data & Secrets:**  \n  No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. External inputs like URL and headers are parameters, not embedded secrets.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:**  \n  The code is transparent and readable; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Reconnection & Error Handling:**  \n  Reconnection employs exponential backoff, a standard pattern. Error handling appears appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score (0):**  \n  No evidence of malware or malicious payloads. Consistent across reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):**  \n  Code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security Risk Score (0.1 - 0.2):**  \n  Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal risk due to network operations but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard network client)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of an SSE client. It does not contain malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The reconnection logic, header management, and event parsing follow best practices. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The comprehensive analysis confirms that the code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent.",
