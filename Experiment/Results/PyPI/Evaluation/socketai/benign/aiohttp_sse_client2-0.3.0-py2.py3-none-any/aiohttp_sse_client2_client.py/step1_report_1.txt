  "purpose": "Implementing an asynchronous server-sent events (SSE) client to connect, receive, and process real-time events from a server.",
  "sources": "URL input parameter, environment variables (not explicitly used here), request headers, network response content",
  "sinks": "Network requests, event handler callbacks, response data parsing",
  "flows": "URL input → connect request → server response → data parsing in __anext__ → event dispatch to callback",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network domains or IPs, no data leaks or privacy violations found",
  "analysis": "The code defines an async context manager for connecting to an SSE endpoint, with methods for handling connection, reconnection, data parsing, and event dispatching. It uses standard libraries and well-known patterns. The reconnection logic employs exponential backoff, and headers are set appropriately to handle SSE. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, system access, or network anomalies are detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code manages network requests, response parsing, and event dispatching securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an SSE client without malicious behavior or security risks. It handles network connections, event processing, and reconnection logic properly. No malicious intent or sabotage is evident.",
