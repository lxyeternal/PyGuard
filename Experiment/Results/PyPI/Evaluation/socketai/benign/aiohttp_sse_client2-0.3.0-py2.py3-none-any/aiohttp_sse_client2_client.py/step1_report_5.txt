{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous server-sent events (SSE) client that connects to a specified URL, handles incoming events, and manages reconnections.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from HTTP response streams, URL parameters, and environment variables (if used outside this code).",
  "sinks": "Uses HTTP request/response mechanisms, potentially vulnerable to injection or mishandling if URL or headers are manipulated externally.",
  "flows": "Connects to URL -> Receives streamed data -> Processes event fields -> Dispatches messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling detected. No obfuscated code, unsafe eval, or unusual dynamic execution observed. The reconnection logic with exponential backoff is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an SSE connection via aiohttp, handles reconnection logic with exponential backoff, and processes incoming event data. It uses standard libraries without evident malicious code. No embedded or hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or system manipulation routines are present. It properly manages session lifecycle, connection states, and event parsing. The use of environment variables is not directly shown; the code depends on external parameters for URL and optional session. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified in the flow of data. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, well-structured SSE client implementation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard SSE client with proper connection handling and event processing. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. It appears safe and intended for legitimate real-time event streaming tasks.",
