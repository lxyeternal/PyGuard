  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only `sys`, defines two functions (`print_info()` and `print_version()`), and executes logic based on `sys.argv`.\n   - No dynamic data processing, network calls, environment variable manipulations, or obfuscated code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The copyright year is 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently suspicious.\n\n2. **Reports Summary:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - They note the absence of suspicious patterns, external data flows, or obfuscation.\n   - The purpose is purely informational, with static outputs.\n\n3. **Issue Presence:**\n   - **Are there any issues in the code?**  \n     No. The code is simple, static, and safe.\n\n4. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign and free of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0; this is correct.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0; appropriate given the code.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0; justified.\n   - **Confidence scores:** All are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n6. **Potential Risks & Justifications:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, external data, or vulnerabilities are present, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Malware score remains at 0.\n   - Obfuscated code score remains at 0.\n\n7. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume static, benign code, which is correct.\n   - No assumptions about future vulnerabilities or unknown malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n8. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
