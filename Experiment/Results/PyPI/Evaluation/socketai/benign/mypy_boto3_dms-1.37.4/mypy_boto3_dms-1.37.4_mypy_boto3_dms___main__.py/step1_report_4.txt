  "purpose": "CLI entry point for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Input source: sys.argv (command-line arguments).",
  "sinks": "Output sinks: sys.stdout.write to display information.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which writes to stdout; otherwise, print_info() writes package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs straightforward output based on arguments.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to print package info and version. It checks for '--version' in sys.argv and displays relevant info. The code only writes static strings to stdout and reads command-line arguments; no external data, environment variables, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility that displays static package information and version number. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this script.",
