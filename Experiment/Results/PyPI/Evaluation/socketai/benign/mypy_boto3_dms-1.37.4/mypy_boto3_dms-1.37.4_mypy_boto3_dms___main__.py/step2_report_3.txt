  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info and version.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no network calls.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code runs only `print_info()` or `print_version()` based on command-line arguments.\n   - The logic is simple and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n   - No inconsistencies or logical flaws are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code only outputs static data, with no suspicious patterns.\n   - The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future, but this is not suspicious; it might be a placeholder or typo, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks.\n   - The code is static, simple, and has no external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - Malware score should be 0, as assigned.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they only describe the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a simple, static CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive reviews provided.",
