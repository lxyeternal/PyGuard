  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code confirmation:**  \nThe code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info and version based on command-line arguments. It does not perform any network activity, data processing beyond argument checking, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n**2. Presence of issues:**  \n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated logic.  \n- No suspicious or malicious patterns.  \n- No external data sinks or network operations.  \n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future, but this is not inherently suspicious; it could be a placeholder or typo.\n\n**3. Logical flaws or mistakes:**  \n- The code logic is simple and correct for its purpose.  \n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning or implementation.\n\n**4. Score evaluations:**  \n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0. Given the code's simplicity and static nature, this is appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, which aligns with the straightforward code.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports give 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**5. Risk score justification:**  \nSince the code only outputs static info and responds to a command-line argument, the risk score should remain at 0. There are no indications of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n**6. Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n- The reports correctly identify no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- The only minor point is the future year (2025), which is not a security concern but might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**  \nAll reports are consistent with each other, assigning zero to malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- The code is a minimal, static CLI utility with no security issues.  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a benign, straightforward CLI script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate as-is.",
