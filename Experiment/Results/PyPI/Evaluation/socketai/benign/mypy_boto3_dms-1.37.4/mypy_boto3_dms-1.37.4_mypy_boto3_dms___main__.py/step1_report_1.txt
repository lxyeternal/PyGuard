  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to output package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; writes package info and version to stdout.",
  "sinks": "stdout (sys.stdout.write) is used to display information; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to stdout output functions; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and typical for a CLI utility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and executes based on command-line arguments. It only outputs static text to stdout based on arguments. There are no external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks detected.",
