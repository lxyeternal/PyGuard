{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes package info and version info to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout, which is a controlled environment and does not present security risk. No external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line input in sys.argv triggers the printing of version information; otherwise, package info is printed. Data flows from sys.argv to control logic, then to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script with functions to print package details and version. It conditionally responds to '--version' argument. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking and outputs static information. There are no external calls, no data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script’s functionality is limited to static data output based on command-line input.",
