  "purpose": "CLI tool for displaying package information and version details about boto3 DatabaseMigrationService",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stdout via sys.stdout.write()",
  "flows": "Reads command-line args -> Determines which info to print -> Prints info to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code simply outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to handle command-line arguments and standard output. It defines two functions, print_info() and print_version(), which output static, non-sensitive package info and version data. The main() function checks for the '--version' argument and prints the version; otherwise, it displays package info. The script runs main() if executed directly. There are no dynamic inputs, no network calls, no environment variable manipulations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and solely outputs static data, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that provides package metadata without any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to display static information based on user input.",
