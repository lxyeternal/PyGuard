  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info and version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic data processing, network activity, or external dependencies are involved.\n   - The functions simply print hardcoded strings to stdout.\n   - The code contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The analysis that the code is safe and only outputs static data is accurate.\n\n3. **Score Review and Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n     - Obfuscated score: 0, correct as there's no obfuscation.\n     - Security risk: 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The code only processes command-line arguments to determine what static info to output.\n   - No assumptions about external inputs or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - All scores are consistent with the code and the reports.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The copyright year 2025 is future-dated, which might be unusual but not suspicious.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis is a simple, static CLI utility that outputs package info and version. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation detected. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Recommendation**:\nNo changes needed; the code is safe and the scores are appropriate.",
