  "purpose": "Provide CLI interface to display package information and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs to stdout).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs package info or version).",
  "flows": "Command-line input (--version) triggers print_version() which outputs version; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The copyright year is 2025, which might be a future date but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it checks for '--version' argument, then prints either version info or package info to stdout. No input is read besides command-line arguments; no untrusted data processing or external network activity. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns. No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. The code does not include third-party dependencies, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI script intended for informational output. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic output based on user input without any suspicious logic.",
