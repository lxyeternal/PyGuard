  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output; no external data sources or dynamic inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to printing version or package info; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs predefined static information. It only reads command-line arguments to decide whether to print version or package info. There are no network calls, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution. The code contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated logic. All security and malware scores are zero, consistent with the benign nature. The future-dated copyright year (2025) is noted but not suspicious. The logic is simple, correct, and safe, with high confidence in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
