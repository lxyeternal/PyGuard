  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) related string constants and configurations for type annotations in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the definition of string Literal types for configuration constants and enumerations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or malicious actions. No runtime data handling or external I/O in the code.",
  "flows": "This code only defines static type annotations; there are no data flows, input handling, or output generation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code strictly defines type literals. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for Python version to import 'Literal' correctly, then defines numerous string literal types representing AWS DMS configuration options. No external data handling, network activity, or runtime logic is present. It is purely type annotation scaffolding meant for static type checking. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are found. The content aligns with standard practices for type hinting in a large AWS SDK or client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a static type annotation module for AWS DMS configurations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, purpose-specific, and does not include any suspicious activity or hidden code.",
