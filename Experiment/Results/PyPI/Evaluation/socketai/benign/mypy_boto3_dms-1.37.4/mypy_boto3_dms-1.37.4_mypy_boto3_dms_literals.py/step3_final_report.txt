  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS DMS and related constants, providing type safety and documentation support.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals representing AWS resource names, service names, waiters, regions, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no data input, output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type alias declarations with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, resource names, waiters, regions, and configuration options. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. No untrusted input sources or sinks are present. The literals are used solely for type annotations and documentation. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The purpose is to enhance type safety and code clarity, not to perform runtime logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type definitions for AWS SDK parameters, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All evidence indicates it is a safe utility module intended for type checking and documentation.",
