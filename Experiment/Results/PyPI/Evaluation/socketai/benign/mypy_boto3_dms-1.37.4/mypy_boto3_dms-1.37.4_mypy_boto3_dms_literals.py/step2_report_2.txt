  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports describe the code as a static module defining string literal types for AWS services, specifically for AWS DMS and related constants. They emphasize that the code is purely declarative, with no dynamic behavior, external input, or network activity. The reports uniformly conclude that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code Content:**  \n  The code consists solely of:\n  - Conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version.\n  - Definitions of multiple string literal types representing AWS resource names, options, waiters, regions, etc.\n  - No functions, no data processing, no external I/O, no dynamic code.\n\n- **Behavior & Flow:**  \n  Static type definitions, no runtime logic, no data flow from untrusted sources.\n\n- **Potential Security Concerns:**  \n  No evidence of:\n  - Malicious code\n  - Backdoors\n  - Obfuscation\n  - Secrets or credentials\n  - External data handling\n  - Dynamic code execution\n\n- **Purpose & Usage:**  \n  The module is intended for static type checking, improving code correctness, and documentation clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Given the absence of any executable logic, network activity, or dynamic behavior, the malware score should be **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques such as encoded strings, dynamic imports, or complex logic. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n### Security Risk:\n\n- The code is purely static type annotations with no handling of untrusted data or external I/O.  \n- No vulnerabilities or attack vectors are present.\n\n**Security risk score:** **0**\n\n### Reasoning about the Scores:\n\n| Aspect | Current Reports | Justification for Adjustments |\n|---------|-------------------|------------------------------|\n| Malware | 0 | No malicious code or behavior detected. |\n| Obfuscated | 0 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation. |\n| Risk | 0 | No security risk, no external data handling, static definitions. |\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThe reports are consistent with my analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign static definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a safe, static set of type annotations for AWS SDKs, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The provided scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that such static type definition modules are used within a trusted codebase. However, in isolation, this code poses no security concern.",
