{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) and AWS service constants used for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, definitions of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only declares constants and type aliases without handling untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is purely type alias declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version-based conditional import of Literal to maintain compatibility with Python versions. It then declares numerous string literal type aliases for AWS DMS and other AWS services, resources, waiters, regions, and paginator names. All definitions are static string literals without any dynamic or user-controlled input. There are no functions, no input handling, no data processing, and no external calls. The purpose is solely for static type checking and documentation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type aliases intended for type annotations in AWS-related Python projects. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is standard, static, and purely declarative, serving as a library of type literals for improved code clarity and correctness.",
