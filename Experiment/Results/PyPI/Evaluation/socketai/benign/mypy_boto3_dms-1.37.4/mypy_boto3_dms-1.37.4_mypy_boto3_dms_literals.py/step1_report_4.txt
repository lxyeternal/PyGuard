{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS DMS and AWS service identifiers to ensure type safety and code clarity in type-annotated Python code.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, version check for importing Literal, and the assignment of string literals to various type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input, no external data handling, no outputs or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; all literals are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns. The code is purely declarative and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions using Literal for string literals relevant to AWS services and AWS DMS. It includes a version check for importing Literal from typing or typing_extensions, which is standard practice. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, no potential for malicious behavior. All literals are static string values, and the code serves solely as a type hinting utility. There are no signs of backdoors, data leakage, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static definition of string literal types used for type safety in AWS-related Python code. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
