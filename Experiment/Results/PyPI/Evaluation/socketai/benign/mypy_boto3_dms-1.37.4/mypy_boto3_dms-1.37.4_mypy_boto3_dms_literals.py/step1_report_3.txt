  "purpose": "Define type literals for boto3 DMS service literals and related constants for type safety.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this is a static definitions module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly defines string literal types and constants with no dynamic code, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various string literal types used in AWS DMS and other AWS services, ensuring type safety and code clarity. The conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version is standard compatibility handling. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors. The code is purely static and intended for type checking and documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static definitions module for type annotations related to AWS SDKs, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or handle untrusted input and serves solely as a type-safe constants declaration.",
