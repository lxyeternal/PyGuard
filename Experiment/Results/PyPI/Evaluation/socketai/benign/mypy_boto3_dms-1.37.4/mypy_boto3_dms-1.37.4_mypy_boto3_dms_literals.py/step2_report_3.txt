  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, analyzing the provided code and the conclusions drawn, to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS services, resources, waiters, regions, and configuration options.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or external data processing exists.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` is standard practice for compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present.\n- The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support via static type annotations.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS DMS parameters and constants.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, static, and purpose-specific. No anomalies or malware detected.\n\n**Risk & malware scores:** Both 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS DMS related string constants.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states that the code is static, with no external data handling or malicious behavior. No anomalies or security risks.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Define type literals for boto3 DMS service parameters and constants.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static, with no malicious or suspicious patterns. No external I/O or dynamic code.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS DMS and AWS identifiers.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately describes the code as static, purpose-specific, and free of malicious patterns. No anomalies.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, fitting for the static, benign code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Define type literals for AWS DMS and related constants.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the static nature, compatibility handling, and absence of malicious activity. No anomalies or security risks.\n\n**Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, purpose-driven, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores of `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0` are justified.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is a benign static type definitions module, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, as a precaution, but effectively zero given static nature)\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or dynamic behavior.  \n- Static constants and type annotations only.  \n- No external data or network activity.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a safe, well-structured static type definitions module for AWS SDKs, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The detailed reviews and consistent conclusions across all reports support a low-risk, benign assessment.",
