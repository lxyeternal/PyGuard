  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS DMS service using boto3-stubs for type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines classes and methods, and uses type annotations for method parameters and return types. No user input or external data sources are read within the code.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations invoke boto3 client operations, but do not include raw data sinks, external network calls, or data leaks directly within this code.",
  "flows": "Method signatures define flows from input parameters (via kwargs and type annotations) to boto3 client method calls. No actual data processing or flow logic is present, as this is primarily interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code is purely structural with type annotations and method signatures. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured type annotation and client interface for the AWS DMS service, designed to provide type safety for boto3 interactions. It uses Python typing features, including overloads, to specify expected operation names and paginator/waiter types. The class and method definitions do not contain executable logic or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is intended solely for type hinting and code assistance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, well-structured type annotation layer for the boto3 DMS client. It provides no indication of malware or security risks. It functions as a static interface with no executable or malicious payloads.",
