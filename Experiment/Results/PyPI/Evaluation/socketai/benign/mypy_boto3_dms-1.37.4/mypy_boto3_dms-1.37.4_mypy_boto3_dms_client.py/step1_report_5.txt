  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for AWS DMS service, providing method signatures, documentation links, and paginator/waiter overloads.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class definitions and method signatures; overload decorators for paginator and waiter methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no code injection or external data processing; methods are primarily signatures and documentation links.",
  "flows": "Method calls with type annotations and overloads, no actual data flow logic or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code strictly defines type annotations, client methods, and overloads with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured type stub for a boto3 client, containing method signatures, type annotations, and overloads for paginators and waiters. It imports standard modules, botocore, and internal modules, and defines a client class with documented methods. No code executes any logic or handles untrusted input. No malicious behavior or sabotage patterns are detected. The code is purely declarative, serving as a static type interface.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a benign, purpose-specific type stub for AWS DMS client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a static type definition, enhancing code correctness and IDE support. No malicious or sabotage behavior is present.",
