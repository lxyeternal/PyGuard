  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check for any inconsistencies, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines type-safe waiters for AWS DMS, with no data processing or external data handling. Uses `Unpack` for flexible kwargs, standard for such patterns. No malicious logic or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n  - **risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code defines waiter classes inheriting from `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with no suspicious logic. No external data processing or network activity. Standard class definitions with documentation links.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — consistent.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n  - **risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, class definitions with type annotations, delegating to parent `wait()` methods. No data manipulation, external calls, or malicious code. Serves as type annotations/support for AWS SDK.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n  - **risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines subclasses with wait methods accepting `**kwargs` with specific types. The only potential concern is that these kwargs could be user-controlled, but in context, these are method signatures meant for type safety, not actual data processing.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — no malicious intent.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — clear class and method definitions.\n  - **risk:** 0 — no security risk, just type annotations.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern: class definitions with wait methods accepting typed kwargs, no data manipulation or external operations. Purpose is for type safety and documentation.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n  - **risk:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk:** All assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature as type annotations and class definitions for SDK support.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured set of type-safe AWS DMS waiter classes, with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n**In summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is purely for type annotations, documentation, and SDK support, with no security threats.",
