  "purpose": "Define custom waiter classes for AWS DMS service to facilitate waiting for specific resource states during migrations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class definitions with wait methods; references to sys.version_info for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "The wait methods call the superclass wait method (inherited from botocore.waiter.Waiter) with no explicit data processing; no external data flows or untrusted input handling evident.",
  "flows": "Class wait methods invoke superclass wait functions, which are part of the AWS SDK; no direct data flow from untrusted sources or external inputs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be straightforward type-annotated class definitions for AWS waiters.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions inheriting from botocore's Waiter, with type annotations and descriptive docstrings linking to documentation. The wait methods delegate to the inherited wait functionality without additional logic or data handling. The imports and class structure are standard for type-safe SDK extensions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or malicious logic. The code seems to serve a purely supportive role for AWS resource waiting mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard, well-structured type definitions for AWS DMS waiters. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
