  "purpose": "Define type-safe waiters for AWS DMS service using boto3 with enhanced type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs module; class method parameters via **kwargs with Unpack typing.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no data leaks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class methods call the parent wait() method with **kwargs, passing data from user inputs; no complex data flow or external calls evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unpack typing for **kwargs; no suspicious or obfuscated code structures; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom Waiter classes for AWS DMS with detailed type annotations and documentation links. No data is processed or transmitted; no external inputs are handled within these classes. The use of Unpack for kwargs is standard for flexible parameter passing. There are no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be purely for type annotations and documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, well-structured set of class definitions for AWS DMS waiters with no evident security threats or malware. It primarily provides type annotations and documentation links for clarity and correctness. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
