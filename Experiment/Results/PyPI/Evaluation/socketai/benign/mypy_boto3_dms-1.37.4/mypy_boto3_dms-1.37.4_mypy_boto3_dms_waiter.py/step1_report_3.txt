  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiter class definitions for the AWS DMS service client, enabling type-safe waiter usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class method definitions, and type annotation imports.",
  "sinks": "Method signatures with **kwargs unpacked into specific request types, but no processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Method calls passing unpacked request types to underlying AWS SDK waiter mechanisms, no direct data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is mainly boilerplate with type annotations and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of waiter classes for AWS DMS, inheriting from boto3's Waiter, with wait methods accepting unpacked request type parameters. It includes version-dependent import logic for Unpack. The code contains documentation links and adheres to standard class design patterns for waiters. No external data handling, no suspicious logic, and no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type-annotated waiter classes for AWS SDK, with no malicious or security-sensitive anomalies. It appears to be intended for use in type-safe AWS resource waiting logic, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
