  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for the AWS DMS service client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type_defs; class method parameters via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The wait methods accept **kwargs with specific type definitions, potentially untrusted data if user-controlled.",
  "flows": "The wait methods receive kwargs, which could be untrusted input, then pass them to the wait method of the superclass Waiter.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; code primarily consists of class definitions with documentation and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several subclasses of Waiter, each with a wait() method that overrides the parent. These methods accept keyword arguments with specific type annotations, referencing various Describe* types. The implementation solely involves method signatures and documentation links; no data manipulation, network calls, or executable code is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. Usage appears to be for type safety and documentation purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of class definitions for AWS DMS waiters with type annotations and documentation links. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe for use as part of a type-safe SDK extension.",
