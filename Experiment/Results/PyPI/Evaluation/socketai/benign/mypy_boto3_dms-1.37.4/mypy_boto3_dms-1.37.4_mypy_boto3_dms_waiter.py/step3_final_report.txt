  "purpose": "Define type-safe waiters for AWS DMS service client with detailed documentation and version compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter, with wait methods accepting **kwargs typed via Unpack[...] of specific request types.",
  "sinks": "The wait() methods accept **kwargs, which could potentially include untrusted data, but are only passed to the parent wait() method without processing.",
  "flows": "wait() methods receive kwargs, unpack via Unpack, and delegate to the superclass Waiter.wait() with no additional logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of **kwargs is standard for SDK wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for AWS DMS waiters, serving as type annotations and documentation support. No data processing, external network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of Unpack in method signatures is typical for flexible argument passing. Documentation links and version-dependent imports ensure clarity and compatibility. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The code's purpose is to enhance type safety and documentation clarity, not to perform any data manipulation or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and purely for type annotations and documentation. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
