  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the context.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from `botocore.waiter.Waiter`.\n- Each class provides a `wait()` method with type annotations, accepting `**kwargs` unpacked into specific request types.\n- The code includes documentation links, version-dependent imports, and detailed type annotations.\n- There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The purpose appears to be to provide type-safe, documented waiters for AWS DMS resources.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward set of type-annotated classes with no malicious intent.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the class definitions and the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is mainly boilerplate for type safety, with no malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Notes that `**kwargs` could accept untrusted data, but since the methods only pass these to the superclass `wait()`, and there's no data processing or external communication, this is not a security concern.\n- **Potential Concern:** If user-controlled data is passed directly into the wait mechanism, it could theoretically cause misuse, but this is standard for SDK wrappers and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, emphasizing that the code is for type safety, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, aligning with the benign analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions, with no data processing, external calls, or security-sensitive operations.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The use of `**kwargs` is standard for SDK wrappers; passing untrusted data could be a concern in a different context, but here it’s just type annotations and method signatures.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk evident)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a well-structured, type-safe extension of AWS SDK waiters for DMS, serving documentation and type annotation purposes. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' assessments.",
