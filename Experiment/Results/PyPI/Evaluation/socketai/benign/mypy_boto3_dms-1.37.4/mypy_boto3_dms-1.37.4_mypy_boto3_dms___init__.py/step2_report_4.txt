  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the code's security implications, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes that the code defines and exports classes/functions related to AWS DMS, based on static strings and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dangerous operations; static string identifiers are safe.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns well with the code content. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code is a typical SDK interface with documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; purely boilerplate setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK module.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, perhaps due to the mention of \"security risk\" in the report, but the code itself is very safe)\n\n**Verdict:** The small security risk score (0.1) seems acceptable, given the nature of the code. No adjustment needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous, focuses on import/export setup.\n- No suspicious behaviors or data handling.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern: import statements, no dynamic code, no untrusted input.\n- No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar assessment: static imports, documentation, no data flow issues.\n- No suspicious code or behaviors.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0).  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1—this is acceptable given the code's nature. The small risk score reflects the minimal concern that static code, if compromised at source, could be misused, but nothing in the code itself indicates actual risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK wrapper module with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors.\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 if considering very minimal risk, but 0 is fine)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, benign, and standard for an SDK interface module.",
