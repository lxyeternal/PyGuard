{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for AWS DMS SDK components, exporting classes, functions, and waiters for use in client code.",
  "sources": "Static string identifiers in client.get_paginator() and client.get_waiter() calls, imports of SDK classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external system interactions; static strings used as identifiers.",
  "flows": "Static identifiers passed directly to SDK methods without dynamic or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behavior, secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static SDK wrapper module, importing SDK classes and functions, defining constants, and exporting them. There are no dynamic inputs, no network or file operations, and no handling of untrusted data. The static string identifiers used in get_paginator() and get_waiter() are predefined and safe. Inline documentation and usage examples are standard and do not contain malicious code. The code structure is simple and conventional, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard SDK interface wrapper with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. It merely re-exports SDK components for ease of use, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
