  "purpose": "Define the version of the package in a static variable.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; static assignment remains isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with an accompanying comment and copyright notice. No input/output, dynamic code, external dependencies, or obfuscation are present. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security or functionality. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious constructs. The overall assessment confirms that this is a standard, safe version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version string assignment with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No modifications are necessary.",
