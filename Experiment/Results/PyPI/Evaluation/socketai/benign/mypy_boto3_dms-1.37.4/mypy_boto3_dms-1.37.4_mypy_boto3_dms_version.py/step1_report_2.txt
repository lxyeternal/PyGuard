  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.37.4' to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright date '2025', which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a version string with a copyright notice. There are no complex operations, no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no third-party dependencies involved. The future copyright date is unusual but not suspicious or malicious. The code contains no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with an unusual copyright year. It poses no security risk or malware concern.",
