  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the findings and scores.\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a static assignment of a version string. No dynamic or malicious behavior.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Reasonable.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid assessment. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same static assignment, with a note about the future copyright year.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: The mention of the future year '2025' is noted as unusual but not malicious. The reasoning is correct.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: No issues; scores are justified.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Static version string assignment, no dynamic behavior.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No flaws; reasoning is consistent.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; straightforward assignment.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**: Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: No concerns.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same static assignment, minimal code.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No flaws detected.\n   - **Scores**: Correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a simple, benign version declaration.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware are present.\n- The scores assigned (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendations**:\n- The code is standard practice for Python packages.\n- The only minor note is the future copyright year, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
