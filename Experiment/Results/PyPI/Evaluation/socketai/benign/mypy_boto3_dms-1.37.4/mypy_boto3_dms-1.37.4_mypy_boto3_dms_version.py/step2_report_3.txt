  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Structure**:  \n   The code is a straightforward variable assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.4\"`, accompanied by comments and a copyright notice.  \n   There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code, no external dependencies, and no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Anomalies**:  \n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a minimal, static declaration of version information.  \n   - The only noted anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is not malicious—just unusual.\n\n3. **Malware and Security Risks**:  \n   - No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or obfuscation is detected in any report.  \n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning**:  \n   - The scores assigned are all 0 or 1, which seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting the clear understanding of the code's purpose.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:  \n   - The only potential concern might be the future copyright year, but this does not impact security or malware risk.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   - The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security issues.  \n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**My own estimates** after reviewing all reports:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious activity or indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — no security risk detected.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a typical version string declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final note**: No changes needed. The analysis confirms that this is a benign, standard practice in package versioning.",
