  "purpose": "Defines the version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ string variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only a static version string is assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.4'. There are no inputs, no external data processing, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious constructs or obfuscated code. The comment indicates 'Source of truth for version' and a copyright statement, which are typical for package version files. The version string appears static and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version declaration without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
