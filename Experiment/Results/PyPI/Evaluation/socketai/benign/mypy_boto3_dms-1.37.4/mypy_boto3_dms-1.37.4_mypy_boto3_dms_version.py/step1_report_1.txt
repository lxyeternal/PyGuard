  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment setting the version string. There are no input sources, no dynamic or malicious code, and no suspicious behaviors. The version string appears to be a standard static assignment. No obfuscation or complex logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is standard practice in Python packages.",
