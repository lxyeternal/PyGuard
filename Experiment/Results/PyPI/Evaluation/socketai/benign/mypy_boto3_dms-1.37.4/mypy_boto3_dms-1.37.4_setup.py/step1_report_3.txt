{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-dms' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; reads package metadata such as name, version, author, etc.; and specifies dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading static files and defining package metadata to executing the setup function with fixed parameters; no untrusted input flows into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for Python package distribution. It reads the README.md file for documentation, defines package metadata, classifiers, dependencies, and URLs. There are no dynamic evaluations, external code executions, or user inputs involved. The install_requires conditionally adds a dependency based on Python version, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or other security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
