{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading a local README.md for description, and providing static metadata to setuptools.setup(). It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file from local filesystem; static strings for package metadata, URLs, dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static data passed directly into setup() function; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py with static imports, file reading, and setup parameters. It does not execute any untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, and the data used is static or from local files. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is safe, benign, and free from security concerns. All reports correctly identify its non-malicious nature. The scores should be maintained at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
