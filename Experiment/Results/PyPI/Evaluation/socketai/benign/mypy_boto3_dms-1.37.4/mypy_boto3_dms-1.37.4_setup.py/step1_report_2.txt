{
  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-dms package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static string data for package configuration; imports from standard library and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. The script is a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. No user input, network calls, or executable code beyond package setup. No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, or malicious commands. The code follows typical Python packaging patterns, and all data is static or standard library functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only contains static package configuration data. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors detected.",
