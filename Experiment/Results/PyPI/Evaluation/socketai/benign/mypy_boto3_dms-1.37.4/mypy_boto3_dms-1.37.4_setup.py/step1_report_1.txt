  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-dms package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md' for reading long description; data in setup() parameters such as name, version, author, url, classifiers, keywords, project_urls, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the script primarily reads files and supplies package metadata. No untrusted data flows or outputs to system or network are observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content and passing static data into setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The script is a standard Python setup configuration with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. No code injection, external network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs. All data is hardcoded or derived from local files, consistent with typical setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for Python packaging. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected.",
