{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-dms package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and static string data for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code only reads local files and defines static package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A — no untrusted data flows; the code reads local files and defines static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, standard setup script with no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for description, and calls setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no reading untrusted inputs, and no suspicious network activity. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The dependencies are standard, and all data appears static and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata, dependencies, and static content. No anomalies or malicious code elements are present.",
