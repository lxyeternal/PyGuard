  "purpose": "Type definitions for DMS service API request and response structures, used for type hinting and validation.",
  "sources": "The code primarily consists of class and type definitions derived from open-source modules, with no direct input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the code does not perform any data output or network operations itself.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are established within these type definitions; they serve as data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No unusual language features, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are detectable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of Python type annotations and TypedDict definitions for AWS DMS (Database Migration Service). It defines data structures, request, response, and configuration schemas used for API interactions. The structure is consistent with standard SDK or library code meant for type checking and documentation. There are no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code strictly focuses on data structure definitions, with no execution logic or external data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS DMS SDK, containing no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It serves purely as a schema and typing aid for the SDK or application development. Therefore, the malware score is 0, security risk is negligible, and confidence in these findings is high.",
