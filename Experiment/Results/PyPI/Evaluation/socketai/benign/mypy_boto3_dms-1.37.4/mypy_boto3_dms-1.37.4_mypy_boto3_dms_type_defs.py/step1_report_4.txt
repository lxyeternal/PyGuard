{
  "purpose": "The code provides type definitions for the AWS DMS service in Python, facilitating type checking and IDE support for the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, and data structures; no input sources or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or data exfiltration points within this code.",
  "flows": "The code defines data flow through type annotations and class structures but does not implement runtime data processing or flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. It mainly defines data schemas and type hints. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "This module is a set of type definitions and data schemas for the AWS DMS SDK in Python. It includes classes, unions, and constants to facilitate static type checking. No runtime logic, input handling, or network operations are present. The code appears standard, structured, and aligned with typical SDK design practices. It does not include any code that could be malicious or sabotage-related, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured set of type definitions for AWS DMS SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It solely provides static type annotations and data structures without runtime or side-effect mechanisms.",
