  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS DMS service API, used for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Constant import statements, class and type definitions, and list of all exported types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network or file I/O; mostly data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of structured type definitions, constant imports, and annotations for a SDK-like module. It does not include runtime code, data processing, or external I/O operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The code is designed for static type checking and documentation purposes. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious logic were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely declarative, defining types and constants for a Python SDK related to AWS DMS. It shows no signs of malicious intent or sabotage, serving solely as a type annotation and documentation aid.",
