  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code in detail.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a large collection of Python type annotations, TypedDict classes, constants, and import statements.\n- It serves as type definitions for the AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) SDK, likely for static type checking, IDE support, and documentation.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or external I/O are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining data schemas and types.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code does not contain runtime or executable logic that could be malicious. It is a schema and type annotation module.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None are evident. The code is consistent, well-structured, and aligns with standard SDK type definition practices.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 across all reports.\n  - Security risk: 0 across all reports.\n  - Confidence: High (1.0 or 1).\n  - Anomalies: None detected.\n  - Purpose: Purely type/schema definitions.\n\n### Logical consistency:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a static, declarative code module with no malicious behavior.\n- The detailed analysis confirms the absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or secret leaks.\n- The type definitions are extensive but standard for an SDK, with no signs of sabotage.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only minor note is that the code relies on conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No runtime code, so no attack surface exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or misleading code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk from static analysis)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and justified.** The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe high confidence is justified, given the purely declarative nature and lack of any suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate SDK type definitions, serving as a static schema layer for AWS DMS in Python. No security concerns or malicious activity are present.",
