  "purpose": "Type definitions for the DMS service in boto3, providing structured data schemas for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "The code defines TypedDict classes and Union types; no input or external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks or data handling mechanisms; it only specifies data schemas.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type definitions with no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated patterns. No unusual or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "This is a comprehensive set of Python type annotations for boto3's DMS API, mainly consisting of TypedDict and Union declarations to structure request and response payloads. The code imports standard libraries, conditional imports based on Python version, and defines numerous data schemas for API communication. There are no runtime behaviors, no data processing, no network calls, and no embedded or obfuscated code segments. All code appears to be standard type declaration and documentation setup for API typing, with no signs of malicious code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is solely a collection of type definitions for API data structures, with no malicious intent, no dynamic or executable code, and no suspicious patterns. It functions as a schema layer for type checking and documentation, presenting no security risks.",
