  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS DMS client paginators, providing structured, type-safe classes for paginator usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters via **kwargs in the paginate methods, which are passed directly to boto3's paginator.paginate() calls.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into boto3's paginator methods; no external data sinks or leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Source (kwargs) flows into boto3's paginator.paginate() method, which handles the pagination logic internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes inheriting from a generic Paginator, with type annotations for request and response types. Each class's paginate method accepts **kwargs, which are passed directly to boto3's SDK, a standard and safe pattern. The code is static, purely structural, and intended for type checking and IDE support. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: near 0) are consistent with the code's benign, static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS DMS paginators, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified; the appropriate assessment is that the code poses no security threat.",
