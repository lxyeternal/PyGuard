  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured permission utility for Django REST Framework, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Its security depends on the integrity of the model permission methods. The dynamic invocation pattern is typical but warrants trust in model implementations. Overall, it is safe within controlled environments."
