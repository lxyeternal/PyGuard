  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is minimal and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external interactions, no inputs, or suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - There is no indication of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and match the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scoring reflects the actual risk level correctly.",
