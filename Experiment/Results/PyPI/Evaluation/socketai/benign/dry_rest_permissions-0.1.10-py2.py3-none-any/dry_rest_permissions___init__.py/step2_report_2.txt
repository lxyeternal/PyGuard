  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or data flows.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard Python packaging conventions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and poses no security risk is correct.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious activity, scores higher than 0.0 are unwarranted.\n   - The current scores correctly reflect zero risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims need to be challenged.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level of 1 is justified given the simplicity and standard practice.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, non-malicious version declaration. No security concerns or suspicious behavior are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
