  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the Python package.",
  "sources": "None; static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a simple static string assignment with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for defining package versioning in Python. It involves no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature. All reports correctly identify this as a straightforward version string assignment, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. There are no anomalies or suspicious signals in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
