{
  "purpose": "Define and expose timezone-related constants, errors, and utility functions for a time management library, ensuring compatibility and clear API structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_exceptions, _impl, helpers), and list of publicly exposed names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily sets up module exports and imports internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. Use of aliases for compatibility is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines public API symbols for a timezone handling library, importing relevant classes and functions from internal modules. It exports these for external use via the __all__ list and creates some aliases for compatibility. No external data input, no network communication, no code injection, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving as an interface layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It primarily organizes and exposes internal components for use by other modules or packages.",
