  "purpose": "Define and export timezone-related classes, functions, and exceptions for a timezone handling library.",
  "sources": "The module imports from internal submodules: helpers, _exceptions, and _impl.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages namespace exports for a timezone library, importing classes, functions, and exceptions from internal modules. The aliases for 'utc' and 'FixedOffset' are standard. No code execution, input handling, or data manipulation occurs. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical module setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization and export script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a timezone management library and does not contain any malware or security threats.",
