{
  "purpose": "Define and expose timezone-related classes, errors, and utility functions for a Python library, likely for timezone management.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.helpers, ._exceptions, ._impl). No external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from sources to sinks is evident. The code only sets up namespace and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares an '__all__' list to specify public API symbols, and imports various classes, functions, and exceptions from internal modules. It also creates aliases for certain classes. There are no data processing, input handling, network calls, or file operations. The code structure is typical for Python package modules. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module initialization and API exposure file with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears safe, focusing solely on defining and exporting timezone utilities and exceptions.",
