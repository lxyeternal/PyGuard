{
  "purpose": "Define public API symbols, import internal modules and classes, and create compatibility aliases for timezone handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_exceptions, _impl, helpers) and module-level variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present; no data leaks or security-sensitive sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mostly static symbol declarations and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard aliasing for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines an API list, imports various internal components, and sets up aliases for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's public API and internal setup, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization script for a timezone-related Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not include any malware indicators or security risks.",
