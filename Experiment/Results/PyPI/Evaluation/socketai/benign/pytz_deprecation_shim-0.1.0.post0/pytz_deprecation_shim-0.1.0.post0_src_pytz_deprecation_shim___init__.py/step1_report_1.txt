{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a timezone handling library, providing error classes, timezone constants, and helper functions.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and attributes from local package files (. and _exceptions, _impl). It also defines a list of publicly available symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects; the code primarily defines constants and imports.",
  "flows": "There are no evident data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is mainly for defining and exporting functions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code structure and content are typical for a library module.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of exported symbols for timezone-related exceptions and constants, importing them from internal modules. It assigns some aliases for compatibility. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or external communications. The structure suggests standard library code for timezone management. No malicious patterns or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard part of a timezone handling library with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It mainly manages internal symbols and exports for external use, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
