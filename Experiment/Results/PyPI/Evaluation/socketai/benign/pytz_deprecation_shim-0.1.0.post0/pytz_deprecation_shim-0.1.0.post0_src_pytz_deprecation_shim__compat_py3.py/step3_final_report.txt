  "purpose": "Utility functions for timezone handling, including loading timezones, creating fixed offsets, and detecting imaginary or ambiguous times.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'zoneinfo' or fallback 'backports.zoneinfo', 'datetime' module, function parameters (timezone key, file, offset, datetime objects).",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network activity, or data leaks; internal data processing only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through functions to produce timezone objects or datetime adjustments; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, standard, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard timezone operations with proper error handling, including fallback imports for compatibility, and functions to detect imaginary and ambiguous times. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. Exception handling is typical, and no external side effects or network activity occur.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard timezone utility module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured and safe for use.",
