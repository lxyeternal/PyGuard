{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom warning and error classes related to time zone handling, and dynamically creates derived exception classes incorporating pytz-specific errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module ._common, runtime warning, error classes, and the pytz library (conditionally).",
  "sinks": "The get_exception function returns an exception instance based on input parameters, which could potentially be used to raise exceptions elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Inputs to get_exception (exc_type, msg) trigger the creation of error classes and return an exception instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The dynamic class creation and use of external library (pytz) are standard for timezone handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages error classes related to timezone operations, wrapping standard pytz exceptions with custom exceptions. It conditionally imports pytz and extends base error classes. No untrusted data sources or malicious code execution pathways are evident. The get_exception function creates exception instances based on inputs, but these are standard exception objects, not executable code or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation of timezone error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages exceptions related to timezone processing, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
