{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for timezone errors and dynamically integrates them with pytz exceptions if available, providing a utility to generate appropriate exception instances based on error type and message.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to get_exception (exc_type, msg); conditional import of pytz; internal class definitions and error mappings.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into vulnerable sinks, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "get_exception receives exc_type and msg, calls _make_pytz_derived_errors to ensure error classes are set up, then returns an exception instance of the mapped type with the provided message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for error class management. Dynamic class creation is controlled and limited to compatibility with pytz. No obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom timezone error classes, conditionally imports pytz, and creates subclasses that combine custom errors with pytz exceptions if available. The get_exception function ensures error classes are initialized and returns an exception instance based on the input type. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic class creation is a common compatibility pattern, not malicious. Exception messages are handled straightforwardly. The scores across reports are consistent and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low security risk scores (around 0.1), reflecting minimal potential for misuse but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured timezone error handling utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior and security posture.",
