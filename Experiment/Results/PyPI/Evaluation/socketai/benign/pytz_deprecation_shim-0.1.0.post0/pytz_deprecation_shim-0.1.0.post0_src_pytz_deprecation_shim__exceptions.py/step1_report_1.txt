{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and error handling for timezone-related errors, including integration with the pytz library if available.",
  "sources": "Import statement for '_common', conditional import of 'pytz' within '_make_pytz_derived_errors', and usage of exception classes and error mapping.",
  "sinks": "The function 'get_exception' constructs and returns exception instances based on input, potentially used for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Input exception type and message -> '_make_pytz_derived_errors' ensures error classes are defined -> get_exception retrieves or creates exception instances based on mapping.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically creates error classes based on the presence of 'pytz' and updates a global error mapping. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exceptions related to timezone errors. It conditionally imports 'pytz' and dynamically extends error classes with pytz-specific errors if available. The '_make_pytz_derived_errors' function ensures proper error class inheritance. The 'get_exception' function returns an exception instance based on a given type and message, useful for error handling. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for error handling related to timezone processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for defining and managing timezone-related exceptions, including integration with 'pytz'. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious or malicious code detected, and the logic is consistent with typical error handling patterns. Overall, this code is safe.",
