{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and dynamically creates error classes that extend both these custom classes and pytz library exceptions, with functions to generate these errors with messages.",
  "sources": "Reads the imported module '_common', and the function get_exception which takes exception types and messages as input.",
  "sinks": "The get_exception function creates and returns exception instances, potentially with untrusted messages.",
  "flows": "The function get_exception calls _make_pytz_derived_errors, which may import pytz and create combined error classes, then get_exception returns an exception instance based on input type and message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles custom and derived exception classes, with a focus on error handling related to pytz time zone operations. It conditionally imports pytz and dynamically creates combined error classes if certain conditions are met. The get_exception function creates exception instances based on provided types and messages, utilizing these custom classes. No input sources are evident besides the parameters, and output is exception objects. There is no evidence of malicious data manipulation, secret handling, or external network activity. The code is straightforward and intended for error handling in time zone operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom error classes with dynamic class creation for better integration with the pytz library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of dynamic class creation is controlled and does not pose obfuscation or malware concerns.",
