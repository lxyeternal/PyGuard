{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and utility functions related to time zone handling and error management, particularly integrating with the pytz library.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules (_common, pytz), functions (pytz_imported()), and exception types.",
  "sinks": "The function get_exception() potentially raises exceptions with custom messages, but no direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input exception types and messages flow into get_exception(), which may create and raise corresponding exception instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. The code relies on conditional import and dynamic class creation, which are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines warning and exception classes related to pytz, and a function _make_pytz_derived_errors() that dynamically creates error subclasses combining custom and pytz exceptions if not already initialized. The get_exception() function ensures proper error class creation and returns an exception instance based on the input type and message. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears solely to handle error management for time zone operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling utility for time zone errors, with no malicious intent detected. It manages exception classes and error conversions, maintaining proper structure without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
