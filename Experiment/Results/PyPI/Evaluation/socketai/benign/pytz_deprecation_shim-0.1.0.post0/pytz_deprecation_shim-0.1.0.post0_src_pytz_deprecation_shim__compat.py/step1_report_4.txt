{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import compatibility functions based on the Python version being used, to ensure cross-version support for timezone-related operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python interpreter version information via sys.version_info.",
  "targets": "It imports modules _compat_py2 or _compat_py3 depending on the Python version, then assigns several attributes from the imported module to local variables.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked to determine which compatibility module to import, and then attributes from that module are assigned to local variables, which are likely used elsewhere in the project.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual behaviors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version at runtime to decide which compatibility module to import. It then assigns various timezone-related functions and constants from the imported module to local variables. This pattern is common for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The code is clean, minimal, and serves a clear purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling Python version compatibility, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a timezone or datetime utility library.",
