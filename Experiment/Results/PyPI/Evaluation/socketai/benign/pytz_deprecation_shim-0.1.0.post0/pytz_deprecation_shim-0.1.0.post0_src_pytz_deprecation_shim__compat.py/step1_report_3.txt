{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports a compatibility module based on the Python version to provide unified timezone-related functions and constants.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "Imports functions and constants from a local module (_compat_py2 or _compat_py3)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → conditional import → _compat_impl functions/constants",
  "anomalies": "None evident; the code uses standard version checking and module import mechanisms",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version at runtime to import appropriate compatibility modules for Python 2 or 3. It then assigns several functions and constants from the imported module to local names. This pattern is typical for maintaining compatibility across Python versions and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a straightforward version-dependent import setup for timezone-related utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard Python version check to import corresponding compatibility modules and assign their functions/constants locally. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. The purpose is to ensure compatibility across Python versions, and it appears safe.",
