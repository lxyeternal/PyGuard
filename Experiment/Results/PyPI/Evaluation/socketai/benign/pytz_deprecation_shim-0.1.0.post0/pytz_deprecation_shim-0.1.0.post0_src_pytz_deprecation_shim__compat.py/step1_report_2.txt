{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports compatibility modules based on Python version to provide consistent timezone-related functions and constants.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, which reads Python version information; import statements for local modules _compat_py2 or _compat_py3.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Based on the Python version, the code imports a specific module and assigns its attributes to local names, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard version compatibility handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script checks the Python major version and imports corresponding compatibility modules (_compat_py2 or _compat_py3). It then assigns various functions and constants from the imported module to local variables. This is a common pattern for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. The code does not process external inputs, generate outputs, or perform any other operations that could be malicious. It is a straightforward version check and import pattern aimed at supporting consistent timezone handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility layer without malicious intent. It performs version-based module imports and attribute assignments to maintain compatibility. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
