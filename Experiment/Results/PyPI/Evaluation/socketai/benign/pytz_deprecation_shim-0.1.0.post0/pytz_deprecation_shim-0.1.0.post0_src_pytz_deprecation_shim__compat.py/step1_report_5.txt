{
  "purpose": "The code imports compatibility functions based on Python version to ensure cross-version compatibility, particularly for timezone-related utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is used to determine which module (_compat_py2 or _compat_py3) to import; then, attributes from that module are assigned to local variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. No suspicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing the sys module to check Python version information. It then conditionally imports one of two internal modules (_compat_py2 or _compat_py3) based on whether the interpreter is Python 2 or 3. Attributes from the selected module are assigned to variables in the current namespace, facilitating compatibility across Python versions for timezone and daylight saving time calculations. The code appears to be part of a compatibility layer, which is a common and benign pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version compatibility pattern for Python packages. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior and is unlikely to pose any security risks.",
