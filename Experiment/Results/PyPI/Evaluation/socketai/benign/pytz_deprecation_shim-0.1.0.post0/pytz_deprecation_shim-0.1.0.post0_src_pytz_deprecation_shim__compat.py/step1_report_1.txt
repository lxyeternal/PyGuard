{
  "purpose": "The code imports compatibility functions and constants based on the Python version to ensure consistent behavior across Python 2 and Python 3 environments.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info[0], module imports (_compat_py2, _compat_py3), attributes from _compat_impl",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or system commands; the code mainly assigns imported attributes to local names",
  "flows": "sys.version_info[0] -> conditional branch -> import _compat_py2 or _compat_py3 -> attribute assignments from _compat_impl",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code performs standard compatibility checks and imports",
  "analysis": "The code checks the major Python version and imports the appropriate compatibility module (_compat_py2 or _compat_py3). It then assigns various functions and constants from the imported module to local variables. This is a typical pattern for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a compatibility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks; it performs a common pattern for version-specific imports.",
