{
  "purpose": "This code provides a compatibility layer for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3 by importing appropriate modules and assigning their functions/constants to local variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info to determine which compatibility module to import.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code only assigns imported functions/constants to local variables.",
  "flows": "The source (version check) leads to importing either _compat_py2 or _compat_py3, from which functions like UTC, get_timezone, etc., are assigned to local variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors. It is a typical compatibility pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple Python version check and imports a module accordingly, then assigns attributes from these modules to local variables. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The pattern is common in cross-version compatibility code, with no external data handling or system modifications. The assigned functions relate to timezone handling, which is standard and benign. The code does not execute untrusted inputs or system commands, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
