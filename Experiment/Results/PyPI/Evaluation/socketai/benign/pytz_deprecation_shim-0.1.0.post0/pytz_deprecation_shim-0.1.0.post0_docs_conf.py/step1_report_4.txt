{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, mainly for project documentation and linking to external resources.",
  "sources": "Reading the version number from an external VERSION file; importing os module; static configuration data such as extensions, paths, themes, and intersphinx mappings.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or external commands executed based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The only file reading occurs in read_version(), which reads a static file to set the version; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The file reads a local file for version info, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward configuration file for Sphinx, importing os to read a local VERSION file for setting the project version. It contains static data defining project info, extensions, paths, themes, and external links. No user input, no network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior are present. The file's purpose is purely configurational with standard practices. The reading of the VERSION file is safe assuming the file's integrity is maintained outside this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It safely reads a local version file and sets configuration options without external or untrusted data handling.",
