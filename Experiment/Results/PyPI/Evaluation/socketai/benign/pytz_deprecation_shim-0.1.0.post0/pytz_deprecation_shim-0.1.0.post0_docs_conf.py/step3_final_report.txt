  "purpose": "Configure Sphinx documentation builder with project info and paths.",
  "sources": "Reading local VERSION file via read_version() function.",
  "sinks": "None; static configuration, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward file reading, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script that reads a local VERSION file using safe file I/O. It sets project metadata, extensions, paths, and theme options. No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present. The use of __file__ for path resolution is typical and safe. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, safe, and standard for documentation setup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
