  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder, including reading version info and setting project options.",
  "sources": "Reading version file via open() in read_version() function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Reading version file, then using this data to set the release variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard configuration with file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a function to read a VERSION file located relative to the script, then assigns the read value to VERSION. It sets project info, extension modules, template paths, and HTML options. The code uses standard Python file I/O and string manipulation with no suspicious or obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no network activity. The extension list and mapping variables are typical for Sphinx configs, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Sphinx configuration file that reads version info from a local file. It does not contain malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for documentation setup.",
