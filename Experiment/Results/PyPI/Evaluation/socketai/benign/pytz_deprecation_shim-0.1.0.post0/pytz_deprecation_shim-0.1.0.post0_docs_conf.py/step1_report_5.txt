  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, including project info, extensions, paths, and links.",
  "sources": "Reading VERSION file via open() in read_version() function.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output directly affected.",
  "flows": "read_version() reads file content and assigns to VERSION, which is used in release.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __file__ in read_version() could pose path issues but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads configuration data, reads a version number from a file, and sets up documentation parameters. The only file operation is reading the VERSION file in a controlled manner. No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or behavior. The approach is typical for a documentation configuration file. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The code is straightforward, with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Sphinx configuration script that reads project version information from a local file. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
