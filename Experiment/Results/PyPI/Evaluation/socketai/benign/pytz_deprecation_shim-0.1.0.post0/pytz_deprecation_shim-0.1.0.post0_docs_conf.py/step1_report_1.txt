  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, including project info, extensions, paths, and links.",
  "sources": "Reading VERSION file in read_version() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions identified.",
  "flows": "The code reads a version string from a local file and assigns static configuration variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The function read_version() reads a file relative to the script location, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets configuration variables for Sphinx documentation. It imports 'os' to handle filesystem paths, reads a version number from a local file '../VERSION', and assigns various configuration options such as project info, extensions, theme, and links. All file operations and variable assignments are straightforward and align with typical configuration scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is well-structured, clear, and uses safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration script that performs simple file reading and variable assignment. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
