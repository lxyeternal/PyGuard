  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The only file operation involves reading a local VERSION file via `read_version()`.\n- No untrusted data, external network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Correctly identifies that the code reads a version file and sets configuration variables.\n- No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.\n- Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0, and risk score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms standard configuration practices.\n- No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence is high, malware is 0, risk is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also confirms the code is a typical configuration script.\n- No external or untrusted data handling.\n- Confidence is high, malware is 0, risk is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusions: safe, standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence is high, malware is 0, risk is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Reiterates that the code reads a local file and sets configuration variables.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Confidence is high, malware is 0, risk is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports indicate 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Any potential concerns?**  \nNo. The code is a typical configuration script with safe practices. The only file reading is from a local, presumably trusted, VERSION file, and no suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
