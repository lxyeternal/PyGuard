{
  "purpose": "The code detects if the 'pytz' module has been imported in the current Python environment without importing it itself.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'sys.modules' dictionary to check for 'pytz' key.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects; simply checks module import status.",
  "flows": "Checks 'sys.modules' for 'pytz' and updates a global flag based on that check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward module presence detection.",
  "analysis": "The code maintains a global boolean indicating whether 'pytz' has been imported. It checks 'sys.modules' to see if 'pytz' is present, which implies the module has been imported at some point during the runtime. The function updates the global variable only if the module has been detected in 'sys.modules' and returns this status. The implementation is simple and does not execute or import any modules itself; it only inspects the current module registry.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard check for module presence without executing any malicious actions or handling untrusted data. It could be part of a larger logic to conditionally import or use 'pytz', but by itself, it poses no security risk.",
