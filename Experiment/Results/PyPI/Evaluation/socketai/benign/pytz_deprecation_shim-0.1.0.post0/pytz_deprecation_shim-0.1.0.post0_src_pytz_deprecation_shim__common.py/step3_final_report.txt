  "purpose": "Detects whether the 'pytz' module has been imported without importing it.",
  "sources": "Checks sys.modules for 'pytz' presence.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; only reads sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Reads sys.modules to determine if 'pytz' is present; caches result in a global variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward presence check with caching.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects sys.modules for 'pytz' without importing it, using a global variable to cache the result. It performs a simple, benign check with no malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The logic is clear and standard, with no signs of data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, utility function for module presence detection, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
