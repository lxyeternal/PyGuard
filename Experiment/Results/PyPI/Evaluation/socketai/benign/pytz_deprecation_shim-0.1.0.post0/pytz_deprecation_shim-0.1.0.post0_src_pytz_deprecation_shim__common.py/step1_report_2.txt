{
  "purpose": "Detects whether the 'pytz' library has been imported without explicitly importing it within the function, for possibly conditional behavior based on timezone handling.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'sys.modules' dictionary to check for the presence of 'pytz'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or pose security risks are present.",
  "flows": "Checks 'sys.modules' for 'pytz' and updates a global flag accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global boolean flag '_PYTZ_IMPORTED' and a function 'pytz_imported' that checks if 'pytz' has already been imported by inspecting 'sys.modules'. It updates the flag if 'pytz' is present. No data is transmitted externally, no malicious or unusual behavior is apparent. The code's purpose is purely to track import status without importing 'pytz' again. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function to detect whether the 'pytz' library has been imported, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
