{
  "purpose": "The code checks whether the 'pytz' module has been imported in the current Python environment without importing it directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'sys.modules' to determine if 'pytz' is already imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present; the code only accesses system modules' state.",
  "flows": "The source (checking 'sys.modules') informs the 'pytz_imported' function's return value, with no external data flow or untrusted input manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a global variable to cache import status, which is typical; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global flag '_PYTZ_IMPORTED' initialized as False. The function 'pytz_imported()' checks if 'pytz' is present in 'sys.modules' without importing 'pytz' itself. If 'pytz' is found, the global flag is set to True. The function then returns this cached value, avoiding repeated lookups. The code operates solely to detect module import status and does not perform any data manipulation, network activity, or malicious behavior. It is a benign utility function intended to track module importation status efficiently.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, safe check for the presence of the 'pytz' module in the current environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward utility function with no malicious intent.",
