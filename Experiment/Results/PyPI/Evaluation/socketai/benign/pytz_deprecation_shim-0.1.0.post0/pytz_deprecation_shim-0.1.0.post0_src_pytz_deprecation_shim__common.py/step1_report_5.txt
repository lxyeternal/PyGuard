{
  "purpose": "The code checks if the 'pytz' module has been imported without explicitly importing it.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'sys.modules' dictionary to determine loaded modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data output or external calls.",
  "flows": "Checks the presence of 'pytz' in 'sys.modules' and sets a global flag accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a global variable to cache import status; no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a global flag and a function to detect if 'pytz' has been imported by inspecting 'sys.modules'. The approach avoids importing 'pytz' directly, which can be useful for conditional logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or system manipulation, is present. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply checks if the 'pytz' module has been imported and caches this status. There is no malicious behavior or security risk identified. It is a benign utility function.",
