  "purpose": "Helper functions to transition from pytz to PEP 495-compatible timezone libraries, including type checks and conversions.",
  "sources": "Timezone objects read via attribute access (e.g., tz.zone, tz.utcoffset), and module import status checks.",
  "sinks": "Calls to internal functions (_compat), attribute access on tz objects, and conditional module imports.",
  "flows": "Type and attribute checks on tz objects, conditional imports of pytz, and conversions via _compat functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; standard dynamic import of 'pytz' controlled by internal checks; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign timezone type detection and conversion, relying on standard library and module attributes. No external data, network activity, or code injection is present. The dynamic import of 'pytz' is a controlled pattern for compatibility, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are used. The functions are straightforward and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for timezone compatibility, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
