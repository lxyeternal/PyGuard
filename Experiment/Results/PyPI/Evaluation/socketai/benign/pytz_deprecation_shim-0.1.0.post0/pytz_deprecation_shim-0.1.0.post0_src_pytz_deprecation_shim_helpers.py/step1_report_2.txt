{
  "purpose": "The module provides helper functions for transitioning from pytz to other timezone libraries, including checking timezone types and converting timezone objects.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and module import status (_common.pytz_imported()), uses imported modules (_compat, _common, and internal pytz modules). No direct user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data leaks, system modifications, or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, checking the type of timezone objects, and returning converted timezone objects based on type checks. No external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code performs standard library and type checks with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily checks whether a timezone object is a pytz zone or a shim and converts it accordingly. It conditionally imports pytz and examines module import status, which is typical for compatibility layers. The functions do not handle untrusted input or perform network, file, or system modifications. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a compatibility layer to identify and convert timezone objects between pytz and modern standards. It performs standard type and module import checks without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
