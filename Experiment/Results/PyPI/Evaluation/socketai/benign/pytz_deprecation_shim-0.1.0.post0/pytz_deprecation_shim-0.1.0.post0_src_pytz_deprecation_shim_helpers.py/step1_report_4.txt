  "purpose": "Helper functions to transition from pytz to a PEP 495-compatible timezone library, including type checking and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_common, _compat, _impl), dynamic import of pytz and pytz.tzinfo.BaseTzInfo, and input parameter 'tz' in functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to functions in _compat (e.g., get_fixed_offset_zone, get_timezone), type checks, and attribute access on 'tz'.",
  "flows": "Input 'tz' is checked for type and attributes, possibly invoking _compat functions that create or retrieve timezone objects based on 'tz' attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow. Use of dynamic import and type checking is standard for timezone handling. No apparent malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a legitimate timezone utility module. It imports standard modules and internal helpers to identify and convert timezone objects from pytz or shim classes to a modern timezone implementation. The functions perform type checks, attribute inspections, and data conversions without executing untrusted data or performing network operations. The dynamic import of pytz is conditional and handled safely. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for timezone management, with no indications of malicious intent. It performs type checking, conversions, and imports in a controlled manner. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
