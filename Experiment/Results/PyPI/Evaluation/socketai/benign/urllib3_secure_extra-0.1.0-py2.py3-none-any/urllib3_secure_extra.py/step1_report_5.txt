  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, only contains version info and a descriptive comment; no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Python script defining a version string and a comment explaining its purpose. There are no dynamic operations, input/output handling, or security-critical functions. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The minimal nature of the code indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as a metadata or informational snippet. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security or contain malicious behavior.",
