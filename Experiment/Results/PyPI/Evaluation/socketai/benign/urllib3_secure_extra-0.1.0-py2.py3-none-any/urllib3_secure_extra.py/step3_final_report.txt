  "sources": "None; the code only defines a version string and contains comments.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, input/output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a simple static marker with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that defines a version string and includes comments describing its purpose. It contains no functions, logic, data processing, or external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence level is justified at 1, given the straightforward and harmless content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code serves solely as metadata for version detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static marker intended for internal version detection or metadata purposes. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign appropriate scores. No further action or concern is warranted.",
