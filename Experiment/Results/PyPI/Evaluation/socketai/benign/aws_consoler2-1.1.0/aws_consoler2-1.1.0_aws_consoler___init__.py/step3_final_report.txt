{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package metadata header, providing author, email, version, and encoding information for the Python package.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only contains static string assignments (__author__, __email__, __version__) and a module docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; there are no input or output operations, only static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package metadata file with only string literals and a docstring. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external communication. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with its benign nature. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward, standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores accurately reflect its harmless nature. No further action or modification is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
