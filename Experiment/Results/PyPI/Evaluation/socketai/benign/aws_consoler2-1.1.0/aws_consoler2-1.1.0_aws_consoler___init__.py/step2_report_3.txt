  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as merely containing package metadata: author, email, version, encoding, and a module docstring.\n- No executable code, data processing, input handling, network communication, or external data sinks are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores at 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets provided are straightforward and match the descriptions: only metadata declarations.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- None. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores seem reasonable given the code content.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n- Since the code is purely metadata with no executable or suspicious content, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are appropriately high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard package metadata, with no security concerns.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be **0**.\n- The provided scores in the reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- No issues are present in the code.\n- The reports' conclusions and scores are accurate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a simple, non-executable package header with no security risks.",
