  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and documentation for the top-level package 'AWS Consoler'. It does not contain executable logic or data processing code.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the module-level variables (__author__, __email__, __version__) that assign string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions or operations that process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code only defines static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors; the code is straightforward and conventional for Python package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard package metadata with no executable or data processing logic. It only assigns string literals to variables describing authorship, email, and version. No sources of untrusted data or sinks are present. The structure is typical for Python package initialization files, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely informational, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
