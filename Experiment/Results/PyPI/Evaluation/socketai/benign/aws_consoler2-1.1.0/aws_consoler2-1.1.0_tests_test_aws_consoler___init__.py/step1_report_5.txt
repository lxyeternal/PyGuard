{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a basic utility function, likely related to data processing or configuration, with no clear malicious intent based on the visible content.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules, and reading from input functions or files (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing data to external files, network connections, or executing system commands if such code exists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks such as file writes or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual code structures observed. No hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was thoroughly reviewed for typical security issues: no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no unsafe data handling identified. The structure and content suggest standard functionality without malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation or malware indicators were found. Without external context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code seems standard and safe, with no malicious or obfuscated patterns detected.",
