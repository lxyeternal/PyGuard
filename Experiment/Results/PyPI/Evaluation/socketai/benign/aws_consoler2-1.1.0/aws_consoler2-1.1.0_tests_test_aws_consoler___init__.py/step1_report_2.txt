  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task or function (not explicitly specified in the prompt).",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment, user input, or external files. Specific source locations are not provided in the prompt, so assuming standard input/output or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands. Exact sinks are not specified, but common points include socket operations or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through function calls or data processing routines. Without explicit code, cannot specify exact source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit anomalies detected due to lack of code provided. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are apparent from the prompt.",
  "analysis": "The review was conducted based on the prompt indicating no code was provided. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks could be identified without actual code content. The general approach involves examining data inputs, processing logic, and data outputs for potential malicious behaviors or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, no malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code appears to be benign or unspecified. Further analysis would require the actual source code.",
