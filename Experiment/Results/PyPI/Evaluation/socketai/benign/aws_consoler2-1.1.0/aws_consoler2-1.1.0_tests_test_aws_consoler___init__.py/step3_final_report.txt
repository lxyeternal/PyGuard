  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources such as environment variables, user input, stdin, external files, network connections, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security effects through network transmission, file system access, subprocess execution, environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (e.g., environment, stdin) to sinks (e.g., network, files, subprocesses), with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, backdoors, or code injection patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code, relying on assumptions and general descriptions. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the absence of evidence. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting the limited visibility. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified. The reasoning is cautious and appropriate given the information.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the confidence levels are suitable. No adjustments are necessary; scores remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2.",
