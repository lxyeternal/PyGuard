  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'aws_consoler2', configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads static files ('README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', requirements files) for description and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; no network or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static file reads used solely for package metadata; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. It reads static files for description and dependencies, which is standard practice. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware scores of 0.0, obfuscation scores of 0.0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
