  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'aws_consoler2' that facilitates AWS CLI credential management.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', and various requirements files ('requirements.txt', 'requirements_test.txt', 'requirements_dev.txt') to gather package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs; the script mainly handles package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads external files to gather dependencies and documentation, then passes data into the setup() function to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard setup tools and straightforward file reads. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup operations: reading documentation and dependency files, defining package metadata, and invoking setuptools.setup() with proper arguments. All file reads are from local files; no user input or untrusted sources are involved. No malicious code or malicious behavior indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No signs of malware, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
