{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'aws_consoler2', used to package and distribute the utility that converts AWS CLI credentials into console access.",
  "sources": "Reads external files: 'README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst', 'requirements.txt', 'requirements_test.txt', 'requirements_dev.txt'; user inputs are not directly handled.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected that process untrusted input; the script mainly reads files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the script uses static data and file contents for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; code is a standard setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: reading requirement files, setting package metadata, and defining entry points. It does not execute user input or network operations, nor does it include code that could be exploited for malicious purposes. There are no hardcoded credentials or secret tokens. The script solely relies on external files for configuration and package metadata, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
