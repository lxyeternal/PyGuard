  "purpose": "Unit tests for the aws_consoler CLI package to verify command-line argument handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements (unittest, cli module) and test methods that invoke cli.main() with various arguments.",
  "sinks": "Calls to cli.main() with different argument lists, which may process or parse input data.",
  "flows": "Test functions supply command-line argument arrays to cli.main(), testing argument parsing behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests designed to validate CLI argument parsing and error handling. It uses standard unittest patterns without dynamic code execution or external data sources. No untrusted data inputs or dangerous operations are present. The test cases only verify expected exit codes for various argument configurations. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for CLI argument validation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
