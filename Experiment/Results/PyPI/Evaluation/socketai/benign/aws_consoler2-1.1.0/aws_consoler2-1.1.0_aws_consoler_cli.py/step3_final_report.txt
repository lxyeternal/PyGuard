{
  "purpose": "This code is a CLI utility for generating AWS console sign-in URLs from user credentials or profiles, facilitating federated access.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments, including credentials, profile names, endpoints, and options for URL opening.",
  "sinks": "The external 'run()' function generates a URL, and 'webbrowser.open()' may open the URL in a browser; no other untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are validated, then passed to 'run()' which produces a URL; if '--open' is specified, the URL is opened in a browser.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs argument parsing, validation, logging, and delegates core URL generation to an external function. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident. The use of 'webbrowser.open()' is benign and consistent with its purpose. The external 'run()' function's security cannot be assessed here, but assuming it is implemented securely, the code itself is safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The code does not contain malicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for AWS URL generation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
