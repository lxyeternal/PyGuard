{
  "purpose": "The script generates an AWS console sign-in link from provided credentials or profile, facilitating user access to AWS management console.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments (access keys, profile, session token, endpoints, region, etc.).",
  "sinks": "The generated URL is either printed or opened in a browser, potentially exposing credentials if mishandled. No other data leaks or system modifications are directly performed.",
  "flows": "User supplies credentials or profile → Validation of inputs → Calls run(args) to generate URL → URL is printed or opened in browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behaviors, no obfuscated code, and no network communications other than standard requests (assumed within 'run'). No malicious file system or privilege escalation activities are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a command-line interface for generating AWS console access links, relying on arguments and configurations. It performs standard argument parsing, validation, and logging. It imports a 'run' function from 'aws_consoler.logic' for core functionality. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not handle or process data beyond user input and URL generation. Its behavior aligns with legitimate tool functionality. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility script for AWS console access link generation, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. It performs standard operations with appropriate input validation and logging, with no indications of security risks or malware.",
