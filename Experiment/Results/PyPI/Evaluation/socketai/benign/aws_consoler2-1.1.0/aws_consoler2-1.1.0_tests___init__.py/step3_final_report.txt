  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal header or placeholder for a Python package/module, indicating encoding and providing a docstring for 'aws_consoler'.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static comments and encoding declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only metadata and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple, benign header with no executable logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a docstring comment, with no functions, classes, data processing, or external calls. It is a minimal placeholder likely auto-generated or scaffolding code for a Python package. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a placeholder or header for a Python package. The provided reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring reflects this. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
