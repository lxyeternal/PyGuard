{
  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation of the aws_consoler project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and aws_consoler; sets sys.path; accesses aws_consoler.__version__; reads environment and system variables for documentation setup.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used to influence system behavior, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "sys.path modification to include parent directory, access of aws_consoler.__version__ for version info, and configuration parameters used for documentation generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; standard Sphinx configuration with no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration script. It imports necessary modules, sets up project information, specifies static and template paths, and configures output options. The only dynamic element is the access to aws_consoler.__version__, which is typical for versioning purposes. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads. No external data inputs, network activity, or secret handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration file for building project documentation. No malicious or suspicious code is present. The code solely manages documentation build settings without any security risks.",
