  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation of the aws_consoler project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, sys, and aws_consoler; sys.path modification.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "sys.path insert modifies module search path; imports aws_consoler; uses aws_consoler.__version__ for version info.",
  "anomalies": "The sys.path modification and import of aws_consoler could be suspicious if aws_consoler contains malicious code, but as a configuration file, this is typical for documentation projects. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no code execution beyond imports and configuration variable assignments. The import of aws_consoler and usage of its __version__ attribute are typical for project documentation. No malicious patterns such as network calls, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure and content are consistent with standard documentation setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign Sphinx configuration file for documentation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It imports a project module to access version info, which is standard practice. No suspicious activity or malicious code identified.",
