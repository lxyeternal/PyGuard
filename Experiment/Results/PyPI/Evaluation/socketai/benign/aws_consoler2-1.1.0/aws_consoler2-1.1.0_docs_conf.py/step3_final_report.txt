  "purpose": "This code is a Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) used for building project documentation, setting up paths, extensions, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Importing `os`, `sys`, and `aws_consoler`; accessing `aws_consoler.__version__`.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Import of `aws_consoler` and reading its `__version__` attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script. It imports standard modules, modifies `sys.path` to include the parent directory, and retrieves the version from `aws_consoler`. There are no dynamic or untrusted data flows, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets. The import of `aws_consoler` and access to its `__version__` attribute are typical for documentation purposes. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
