  "purpose": "Configuration file for building AWS Consoler documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules, accesses aws_consoler.__version__, and modifies sys.path.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports aws_consoler to access its version; modifies sys.path to include parent directory; no untrusted input flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard Sphinx configuration with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration script. It modifies sys.path to include the parent directory, imports the aws_consoler module to retrieve version info, and sets various configuration options for documentation generation. No data input or external untrusted sources are read during execution that could lead to security risks. No suspicious code behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious activities are present. All code appears to serve legitimate build configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It primarily manages documentation build settings without handling sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
