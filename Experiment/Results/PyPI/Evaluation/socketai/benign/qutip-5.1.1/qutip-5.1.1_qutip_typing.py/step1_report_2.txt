{
  "purpose": "Defines type hints, protocols, and data structures for a quantum object evolution library, facilitating flexible input specifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'typing', 'numbers', 'numpy', and 'scipy.interpolate' modules; no user input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code primarily declares types and protocols without executing untrusted operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; type declarations are static and do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code contains only standard type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions, protocol declarations, and import statements to support a larger library. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious functions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure appears standard and adheres to common Python typing practices. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type definitions and protocols for a quantum object evolution library. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this fragment.",
