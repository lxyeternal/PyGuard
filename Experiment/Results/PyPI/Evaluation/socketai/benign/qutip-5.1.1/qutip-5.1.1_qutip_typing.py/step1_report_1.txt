{
  "purpose": "This code defines type hints, protocols, and union types for a scientific computing library related to quantum objects and interpolation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and third-party libraries (typing, numbers, numpy, scipy), class definitions, and type alias assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent over network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations or network actions; mainly type definitions and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. Use of third-party libraries (numpy, scipy) is standard for scientific computations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, protocol definitions, and type unions to facilitate static type checking. No runtime logic, data processing, or external input/output operations are present. All imports are from standard or widely used scientific libraries. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The structure and formatting are typical for type definition modules. No anomalies or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a larger scientific computing library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly defines types and protocols to support type checking and code clarity.",
