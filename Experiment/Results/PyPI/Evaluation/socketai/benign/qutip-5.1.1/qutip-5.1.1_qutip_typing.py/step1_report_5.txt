{
  "purpose": "Define type hints, protocols, and type aliases for a quantum object evolution library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, class protocol declarations",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; code mainly defines interfaces and types",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares protocols and type aliases",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed; standard type annotations and protocol declarations",
  "analysis": "The code establishes various type hints and protocols for handling quantum objects, coefficients, and space dimensions. It uses standard Python typing features and third-party scientific libraries (numpy, scipy). There are no dynamic code executions, no input/output handling, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic. No indication of malicious behavior or sabotage. The import of scientific libraries is expected for computational tasks, not malicious activity. The structure and format are consistent with normal code documentation for type safety and interface design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of type hints and protocols for a scientific computing package involving quantum objects. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks.",
