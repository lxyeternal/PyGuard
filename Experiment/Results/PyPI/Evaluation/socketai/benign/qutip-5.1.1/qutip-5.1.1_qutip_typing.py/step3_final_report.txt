  "purpose": "Type annotations, protocols, and union type definitions for a scientific or quantum computing library.",
  "sources": "Type hints, class definitions, and union type aliases within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely structural and does not execute runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, protocol definitions, and union type aliases, with imports from standard and scientific libraries. It lacks runtime logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence. The scores are appropriate given the code's purpose as interface definitions for a scientific library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or security concerns. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
