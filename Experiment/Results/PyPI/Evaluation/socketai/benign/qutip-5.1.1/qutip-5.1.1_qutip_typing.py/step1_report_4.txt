{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations, protocols, and data type unions for a quantum object evolution module, likely intended for scientific or quantum computing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules such as typing, numbers, numpy, and scipy to define types and protocols. No external or untrusted data inputs are explicitly read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or data outputs, especially no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up type annotations and protocols, with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is primarily type definitions and interface protocols.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Python type annotations, protocols, and data unions for a scientific or quantum computing library. It utilizes standard modules like typing, numpy, and scipy without any dynamic code execution or data handling that could be malicious. No input/output operations, network activity, or system modifications are present. All constructs appear to be standard and intended for defining data types and protocols. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type definitions and interface protocols for a scientific Python library. There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or obfuscation present.",
