  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; the fallback Normalize class is a benign dummy; no external data or network activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely for visualization utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid, consistent, and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; notes the fallback Normalize class is minimal and benign; no external activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The fallback class does nothing, just prevents errors if matplotlib is missing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 — the slight risk is justified given the fallback's minimal presence, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious behavior; fallback Normalize class is benign.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code’s purpose is visualization, with no malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous; no external data or malicious activity; fallback Normalize class is harmless.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same general assessment; no malicious activity; fallback is harmless.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior. The code is purely for visualization purposes.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), justified by the fallback class that does nothing but could, in theory, cause silent failures if matplotlib isn't installed. However, this is a benign pattern often used for compatibility.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, benign fallback handling.\n\n**Additional notes:** The code is a standard visualization utility module with no signs of supply chain risk, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The fallback class is a common pattern to ensure compatibility, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and intended solely for visualization purposes. The minor fallback behavior does not constitute a security risk but is noted for completeness.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
