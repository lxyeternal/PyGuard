  "purpose": "Utility functions for enhancing Matplotlib visualizations, including custom colormaps and normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads color specifications, numpy arrays for data, and matplotlib modules for plotting.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily creates colormaps and normalizations without executing untrusted input or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (Wigner array, color strings) flows into colormap creation functions; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback class for Normalize has an empty __init__ method which might be problematic but is not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for plotting: a custom nonlinear colormap emphasizing negative values, a cyclic colormap for complex phases, and a normalization class centered on a midpoint. The fallback class for Normalize is a minimal stub, possibly for environments without matplotlib, but it does not perform any malicious actions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or embedded malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility functions for visualization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely creates visual colormaps and normalization objects for use in plotting.",
