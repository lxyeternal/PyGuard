  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating custom colormaps and normalization in Matplotlib for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Wigner array input for wigner_cmap; color strings for colormap creation; data arrays for normalization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data flow or network activity; only local data processing for visualization.",
  "flows": "Input arrays and color strings are processed to generate colormaps and normalization objects; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback Normalize class is a minimal stub that does nothing, which could cause silent errors if used improperly, but it is benign and a common pattern for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward visualization utility with functions to generate colormaps emphasizing negative values and phase cycles, along with a normalization class for centering colormap around a midpoint. The fallback Normalize class is a benign placeholder used if matplotlib is unavailable. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The fallback class does not perform any harmful actions and is a standard pattern for optional dependencies. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or execute dynamic code. The overall structure and content are benign and intended solely for visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe visualization utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The fallback class is harmless and commonly used for compatibility. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
