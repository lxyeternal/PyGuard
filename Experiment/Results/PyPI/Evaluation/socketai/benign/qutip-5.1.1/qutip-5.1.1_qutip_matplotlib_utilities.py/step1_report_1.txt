{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for enhanced colormap creation and normalization in Matplotlib, specifically for visualizing Wigner functions and complex phases.",
  "sources": "Imports NumPy and conditionally imports Matplotlib modules; no other external data sources or input functions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data outputs, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. Functions process input arrays and generate colormaps or normalization objects without side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback class 'Normalize' defined in the except block is a dummy that does nothing, which could be a concern if used improperly; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates color maps and a normalization class for plotting purposes. It uses standard libraries and straightforward interpolation logic. The fallback Normalize class is benign and designed for environments lacking Matplotlib. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code constructs. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. Its functionality is focused on colormap generation and normalization for plotting, with no suspicious behavior observed.",
