  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and then synthesize an overall security estimate.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a legitimate visualization utility with no malicious intent. The fallback Normalize class is a benign placeholder.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and the fallback is harmless.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the fallback Normalize class being minimal and benign. No suspicious code or external data flow.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to the fallback class)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The slight security risk score is justified by the fallback class, which does nothing and poses no threat. No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard visualization utility functions with no malicious activity. The fallback Normalize class is a safe minimal stub.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the previous reports. No malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous assessments; safe utility functions with benign fallback.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to the fallback class)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Justified. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; standard visualization code, fallback is harmless.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to fallback)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, consistent with the code's purpose as visualization utilities.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the fallback class, but this is benign and common in optional dependency handling.\n- **Scores justification:** The fallback class for Normalize is minimal and harmless; no code indicates malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n**Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n**Risk score:** Given the minimal fallback and no malicious activity, a conservative but accurate estimate would be **0** or very close to it, say **0.05** to reflect the minor fallback concern.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a legitimate visualization utility module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The fallback class is benign and common practice for optional dependencies.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.05**\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern, consistent with the detailed reviews.",
