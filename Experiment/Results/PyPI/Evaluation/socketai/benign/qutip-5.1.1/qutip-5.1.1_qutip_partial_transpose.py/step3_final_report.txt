  "purpose": "Implementation of partial transpose operations on quantum density matrices (Qobj), supporting dense and sparse methods for quantum systems.",
  "sources": "Reads data from rho via rho.full(), rho.to('CSR').data.as_scipy(), and internal index functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code performs internal matrix manipulations without external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from rho to numpy/scipy matrix operations, with index-based transformations for partial transpose, resulting in a new Qobj.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard linear algebra operations for quantum partial transpose, using numpy and scipy libraries. It includes dense and sparse implementations, both following accepted methods. No external network calls, file I/O beyond internal data structures, or system modifications are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies solely on scientific libraries. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of partial transpose operations in quantum information processing. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
