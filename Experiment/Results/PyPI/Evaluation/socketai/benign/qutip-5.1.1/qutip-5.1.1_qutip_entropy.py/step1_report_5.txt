{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for calculating various quantum information metrics such as entropy, concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and entangling power for quantum states represented as density matrices or vectors.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data primarily from function parameters, specifically quantum objects (rho, sigma, U, etc.), which are expected to be quantum states or operators. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data leads to external actions such as network communication, file writing, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into calculations involving eigenvalues, partial transpose, tensor products, and matrix operations. These computations are standard mathematical procedures with no evident malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present. The code employs standard libraries and typical quantum information calculations. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard quantum information metrics calculations, such as von Neumann entropy, linear entropy, concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and entangling power. All functions operate on quantum objects and involve mathematical operations like eigenvalue decomposition, matrix square roots, tensor products, and partial transpose, which are typical for this domain. No indications of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden system modifications are present. The functions include input validation and error handling, and the operations are straightforward. The imports are from standard quantum computing libraries. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate, implementing common quantum information algorithms without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of quantum information metric calculations with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious data handling. It uses standard mathematical operations on quantum states and operators. The absence of network calls, file operations, or obfuscated logic supports a benign assessment.",
