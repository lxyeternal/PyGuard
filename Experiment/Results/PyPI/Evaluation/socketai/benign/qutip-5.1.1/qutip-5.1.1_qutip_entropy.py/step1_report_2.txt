  "purpose": "This module provides various functions to compute quantum information measures such as entropy, concurrence, negativity, and entangling power for quantum states and operations.",
  "sources": "Data is read primarily from the 'rho' and 'sigma' quantum objects, including their eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix elements. Input parameters such as density matrices or vectors also serve as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calculations of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix traces. No direct data leaks or system modifications are observed. No external network communication, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input quantum objects are processed through eigenvalue/eigenvector computations or matrix operations, leading to calculations of entropies, negativity, concurrence, or entangling power. These computations are internal and do not involve untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code performs standard quantum information calculations using well-established mathematical procedures. All functions operate on the assumption of valid quantum objects. There is a commented 'Experimental' note in negativity but no code behavior to indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate quantum information calculations, including entropy measures, concurrence, negativity, and entangling power. The functions include input validation, eigenvalue/eigenvector computations, and matrix operations consistent with scientific methods. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage code are observed. The only unusual note is the 'Experimental' comment on negativity, which is standard for research features, not malicious. All external libraries used are common for quantum computing in Python. No hardcoded secrets or anomalous logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a collection of legitimate quantum information functions with no malicious intent. It follows standard practices for quantum state processing and entropy calculations. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or supply chain attacks within this module.",
