  "purpose": "Implementations of quantum information measures such as von Neumann entropy, linear entropy, concurrence, negativity, mutual information, relative entropy, conditional entropy, participation ratio, and entangling power, using standard eigenvalue and tensor operations.",
  "sources": "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of density matrices, partial transpose operations, tensor products, and quantum object properties (e.g., type, dims).",
  "sinks": "Internal computations involving eigenvalue decompositions, matrix manipulations, and tensor operations; no external data transmission or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Eigenvalue and eigenvector extraction from density matrices → computations of entropy, concurrence, negativity, etc. → return of scalar measures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external communications detected. The 'Experimental' note in negativity is standard for research features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard quantum information calculations with well-understood numerical methods. It reads eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and density matrices, processes them via eigen-decomposition, tensor products, and partial transpose functions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leaks, or backdoors, are present. The functions are typical for scientific quantum computing libraries. The security and malware scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting the benign, purely computational nature. Confidence is high (around 0.9-1), given the straightforward implementation and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of quantum information measures with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
