{
  "purpose": "Provide various quantum information theory and quantum entanglement measures, including entropy calculations, negativity, concurrence, and entangling power for quantum states and operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input quantum objects (rho, sigma, U) via function parameters; imports data from local modules and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Calculations involve eigenvalues, eigenvectors, matrix operations, and logs, but no evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input quantum states or operators are processed to compute measures like entropy, negativity, and concurrence through eigen-decomposition, partial transpose, and matrix operations. No external or untrusted data source flows into system beyond input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. All operations are standard quantum information calculations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard quantum information theory calculations with appropriate validation and exception handling. Eigenvalue decompositions, matrix manipulations, and entropy computations are performed securely. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration techniques are present. The code relies on external scientific libraries for numerical operations. No anomalies indicating malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of quantum entropy and entanglement measures with no signs of malicious intent. It adheres to standard practices for quantum data analysis. There is low suspicion of supply chain attack or malware.",
