  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build script for QuTiP, reading version info from 'VERSION', git, environment variables, and source files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes subprocess for 'git rev-parse', writes version info, builds Cython extensions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess call to 'git' is typical for versioning. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, no malware or security issues.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: Very low, 0.1 is reasonable for standard build operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, handling version info, subprocess calls, and extension compilation.\n- No suspicious code or external activity.\n- Proper exception handling for subprocess.\n- **Conclusion:** Also appears legitimate.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 seems appropriate, considering normal build activities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on versioning, source file handling, and compilation flags.\n- Uses subprocess for 'git', writes version and header files.\n- No malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup script, safe.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 is reasonable, given standard build procedures.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis: versioning, environment variables, 'git' subprocess, file writes, extension compilation.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build process.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 fits typical build scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same pattern: reads version info, calls 'git', compiles extensions.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe setup script.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.0 or 0.1, but 0 is acceptable given no risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The subprocess call to 'git' is standard for versioning, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero but still very low, as the script performs typical build operations.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** Given the standard nature of the code, a risk score of **0.1** is appropriate; no elevated risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package (likely QuTiP). It performs expected tasks such as version management, extension compilation, and environment configuration. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The subprocess call to 'git' is typical for version tagging and is properly handled.\n\n**Final Malware Score:** 0  \n**Final Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Final Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
