  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Content of the code snippets**: All reports indicate that the provided code consists solely of license comments, copyright notices, and module docstrings. There are no executable statements, data processing, or code logic present.\n\n2. **Presence of malicious activity or anomalies**: None of the reports detect any suspicious code, obfuscation, or potential vulnerabilities. The code is purely informational, serving as documentation and licensing metadata.\n\n3. **Scores assigned**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable or suspicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of any obfuscation or code complexity.\n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the content being non-executable and purely informational.\n\n4. **Logic and reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and poses no security risks.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n5. **Potential discrepancies**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the described content.\n   - Since the code is only licensing comments and documentation, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Final note**: Given the content, there's no indication of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is purely documentation, posing no security risk.",
