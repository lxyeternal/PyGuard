  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code defines interfaces and a fallback stub class for missing modules. No executable logic, no data processing, no external inputs, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely declarative interface definitions with a standard fallback pattern. No security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring aligns well with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with interface definitions and a fallback stub class for missing modules. No data handling or external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The fallback stub is standard for optional dependencies, not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring is justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—interface definitions with a fallback stub class. Slightly higher concern about the fallback stub possibly being used to mask missing dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.1 is somewhat cautious but still reasonable given the fallback stub could be misused if exploited. However, in this context, it’s a common pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable, though perhaps a 0.0 for risk could also be justified. Still, 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—interfaces and a fallback stub class, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security issues detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous—interface definitions, conditional import, fallback stub. No runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues with the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, with no obfuscation techniques detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, with one report assigning 0.1, which is acceptable given the fallback stub pattern—it's a common, benign practice but could be marginally risky if misused.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard interface module with conditional import handling, designed for compatibility and fallback. It contains no executable logic, no external data handling, no network or system modifications, and no malicious behavior.\n- The fallback stub class, while potentially misused, is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (a very low, negligible risk, considering the fallback pattern is benign in this context)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature. No changes are necessary. The code is a benign, standard interface definition with a fallback stub for missing dependencies, typical in modular frameworks like Zope.",
