  "purpose": "Define interfaces and classes for TALES (Template Attribute Language Expression Syntax) in the Zope framework, including iteration and expression handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from zope.interface and zope.tal.interfaces, module import error handling, class and method definitions, exception handling for ModuleNotFoundError.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs. The code primarily defines interfaces and stub classes without executing or handling external data.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks. The code defines abstract interfaces and a fallback stub class; no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to provide a stub class for missing modules, which is a standard fallback mechanism. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up interfaces related to TALES evaluation within the Zope framework. It handles missing module imports gracefully with a fallback stub class. No code executes untrusted inputs or performs network, file, or system modifications. The classes are purely interface definitions with no implementation logic that could be malicious. There are no obfuscation techniques, malicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface definition module for Zope's TALES system with a fallback stub class for missing dependencies. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The fallback mechanism is a common pattern and not suspicious.",
