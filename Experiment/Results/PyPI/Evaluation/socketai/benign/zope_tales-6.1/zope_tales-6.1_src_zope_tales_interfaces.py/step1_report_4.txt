  "purpose": "Define interfaces and stub classes for TALES (Template Attribute Language Expression Syntax) used in Zope/zope.tal framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from zope.interface and zope.tal.interfaces (conditionally), module import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily declares interfaces and stub methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except for conditional import, defining a stub class in case of ModuleNotFoundError. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow. The methods are interface definitions, not implementations, which is standard for such code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of interface definitions and a stub class for backward compatibility. It imports modules conditionally and defines methods that are meant to be implemented elsewhere. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The use of try-except to handle missing modules is common practice. The purpose appears to be to ensure compatibility or provide placeholders, not to perform any operation with security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface definition module with a stub fallback class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or supply chain attacks. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate interface definitions for a templating system.",
