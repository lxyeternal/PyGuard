  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' to declare a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a standard namespace declaration pattern; no unusual behavior or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. It does not perform any input/output, network operations, or data manipulation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The purpose is solely to declare a namespace, a typical practice in package structuring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate, safe package setup statement.",
