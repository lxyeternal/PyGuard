  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> call to 'declare_namespace' with '__name__'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for namespace declaration; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard setuptools utility, 'pkg_resources', and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern used in Python packaging to allow multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace. The code appears to be legitimate and is a typical setup step in namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious logic. It does not involve any dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration using 'pkg_resources' and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for Python packages that are part of a namespace package structure.",
