  "purpose": "Declare namespace package via pkg_resources for Python packaging.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkg_resources' using __import__",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external data handling",
  "flows": "Import 'pkg_resources' -> call declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ instead of standard import; no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace with __name__, a common pattern in Python packaging. It involves no data flow, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard namespace declaration. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The use of __import__ is unusual but not malicious, and the code is straightforward and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
