  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkg_resources') statement imports the pkg_resources module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module and declares a namespace; no data flows to or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. There are no input sources or external data interactions. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or secret handling. It is a standard, benign construct used in Python packaging. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical declaration of a namespace package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit any malicious or obfuscated characteristics.",
