  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; no untrusted data processing is present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' leads to calling 'declare_namespace', which is a package declaration, not data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import and namespace declaration but nothing unusual or suspicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and immediately declares the current package as a namespace. This is a common pattern in Python namespace packages. No data input, no data output, no untrusted sources, and no malicious logic are present. It is a minimal, standard code snippet for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace declaration for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe.",
