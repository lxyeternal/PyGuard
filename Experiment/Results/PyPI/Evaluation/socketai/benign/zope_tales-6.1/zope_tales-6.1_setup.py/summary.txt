  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified given the static and controlled file reads; it should be adjusted to 0.0. Overall, the package is safe for use."
