  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading points such as user input, environment variables, external files, network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, system commands, file writes, or other external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or external communications), possibly via intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, suspicious network connections, obfuscation patterns, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators. The scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, reflecting no detected malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risk scores are low (0.2), justified by potential input handling concerns but no confirmed malicious activity. Confidence levels are moderate to high, given the limited code context. The reasoning across reports is consistent, and no red flags are identified. Given the absence of evidence, the overall assessment supports a benign evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and analyses collectively indicate no malicious or obfuscated code present. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at zero. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on current evidence.",
