  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of dynamic execution functions like exec(), which warrants cautious risk assessment. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments suggest risk scores of 0.2-0.3 for low suspicion, with Report 5's risk slightly increased to 0.5 if emphasizing potential dangers. Overall, the supply chain appears secure with no evidence of malware."
