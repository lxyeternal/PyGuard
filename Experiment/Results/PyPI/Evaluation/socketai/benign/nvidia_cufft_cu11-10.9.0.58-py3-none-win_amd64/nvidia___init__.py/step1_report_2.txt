  "sinks": "There are no sinks or output functions, system calls, or data exfiltration points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable due to the absence of any operational code or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is entirely empty or contains only whitespace; no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. The lack of content itself is noteworthy but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code lacks any executable statements, data handling, or logic. It neither reads input nor performs actions. Without additional context, it appears to be an empty or placeholder file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identifiable. Given the absence of code, there is low confidence in any malicious activity or security concern.",
