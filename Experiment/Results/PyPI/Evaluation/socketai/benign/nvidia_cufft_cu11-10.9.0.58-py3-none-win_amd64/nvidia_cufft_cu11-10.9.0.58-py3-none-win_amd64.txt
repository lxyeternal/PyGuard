      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency shows no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of dynamic execution functions like exec(), which warrants cautious risk assessment. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments suggest risk scores of 0.2-0.3 for low suspicion, with Report 5's risk slightly increased to 0.5 if emphasizing potential dangers. Overall, the supply chain appears secure with no evidence of malware."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate concern. While no explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, the patterns warrant cautious review. The current scores are reasonable, but increasing malware suspicion slightly for reports 1 and 3 enhances accuracy. Overall, the dependency should be treated with caution pending further analysis."

      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are low risk, but report 5's suspicious features warrant a higher malware and obfuscation score. Adjustments to reflect moderate suspicion are justified, especially increasing malware from 0.4 to 0.6 and obfuscated from 0.4 to 0.5. The overall security risk remains moderate, consistent with the analysis."
