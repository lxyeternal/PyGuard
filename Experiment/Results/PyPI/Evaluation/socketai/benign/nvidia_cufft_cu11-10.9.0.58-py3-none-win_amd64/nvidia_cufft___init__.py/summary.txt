  "security_risk": 0.45,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate concern. While no explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, the patterns warrant cautious review. The current scores are reasonable, but increasing malware suspicion slightly for reports 1 and 3 enhances accuracy. Overall, the dependency should be treated with caution pending further analysis."
