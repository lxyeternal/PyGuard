  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are low risk, but report 5's suspicious features warrant a higher malware and obfuscation score. Adjustments to reflect moderate suspicion are justified, especially increasing malware from 0.4 to 0.6 and obfuscated from 0.4 to 0.5. The overall security risk remains moderate, consistent with the analysis."
