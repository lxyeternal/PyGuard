  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python code snippets.",
  "sources": "Input collection, environment variables, network requests, dynamic code execution (eval), and potential obfuscation mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, dynamic eval execution, environment variable access, and data handling points that could leak information or execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into eval or network functions, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, dynamic code execution, obfuscation suspicion, network communication, incomplete code, and potential hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate that most snippets are benign, with low malware and obfuscation scores, justified by straightforward operations and lack of suspicious patterns. Report 5 shows dynamic eval and network activity, raising suspicion. The scores for this report are moderate but could be increased to reflect the higher suspicion level. The overall assessment aligns with the provided signals, with the main concern being the eval usage and obfuscation indicators in report 5.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are low risk, but report 5's suspicious features warrant a higher malware and obfuscation score. Adjustments to reflect moderate suspicion are justified, especially increasing malware from 0.4 to 0.6 and obfuscated from 0.4 to 0.5. The overall security risk remains moderate, consistent with the analysis.",
