{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 shield service client, providing type hints for pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or sensitive data handling present; no external network or system interactions.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes and methods for type-safe pagination, flow is limited to type annotations and class inheritance without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations for paginator classes, ensuring type safety for boto3 Shield client paginators. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, defines classes with clear documentation links, and uses standard Python typing practices. No data processing, user input, or network operations are present. The structure is straightforward, consistent, and aligns with standard type hinting for boto3 clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of type annotations and class inheritance for boto3 paginator classes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
