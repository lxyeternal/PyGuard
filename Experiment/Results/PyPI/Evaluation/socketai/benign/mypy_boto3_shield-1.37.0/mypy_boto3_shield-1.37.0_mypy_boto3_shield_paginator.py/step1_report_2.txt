  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Shield client in boto3, with support for type checking and documentation references.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; potential user input indirectly via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (kwargs) passed directly to boto3 paginator methods, potential for untrusted data flow if external inputs are untrusted, but typical usage does not involve untrusted input.",
  "flows": "User calls paginate() method with kwargs, which are unpacked and passed to the underlying boto3 paginator. No data is read from untrusted sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs; the code appears to be standard, well-structured type annotations and class definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two paginator classes inheriting from Paginator with proper type annotations. Conditional import based on Python version is standard. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hinting avoids runtime overhead. No external data reads, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic. The code strictly focuses on type annotations, documentation links, and class structure for AWS SDK pagination.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, intended for type annotation and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured module for AWS boto3 paginator classes.",
