  "purpose": "Provides type annotations and paginator classes for AWS Shield SDK, enhancing type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, type definitions, and configuration checks for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; method parameters are type-checked, with no external data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Method kwargs flow into boto3 paginator methods; no untrusted data flows or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "Standard class inheritance with conditional imports for Python version compatibility; no dynamic code execution or secrets; straightforward implementation focused on type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe, serving as a type annotation module for boto3 Shield paginators with no malicious or security issues.",
