{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS Shield client, facilitating type-safe pagination of 'list_attacks' and 'list_protections' API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; system version check for Unpack; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input; no network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; functions are simple method definitions with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard, well-structured type annotation and class inheritance for AWS SDK paginator classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS Shield service with proper type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and clear documentation links. No runtime input, network activity, or suspicious code execution paths are present. The code is primarily declarative, extending existing AWS SDK classes with type hints, and does not include any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-documented type annotations module for AWS SDK paginators with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate component intended to enhance type safety in a larger codebase.",
