  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginators for AWS Shield service client, facilitating type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions. Usage of sys.version_info to conditionally import Unpack.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code primarily defines classes and methods with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 Shield client. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or data leaks. The classes extend existing boto3 paginator classes with specific type annotations for responses and requests. No external data manipulation, network activity, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and class definition module for boto3 paginators. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security issues. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious activity.",
