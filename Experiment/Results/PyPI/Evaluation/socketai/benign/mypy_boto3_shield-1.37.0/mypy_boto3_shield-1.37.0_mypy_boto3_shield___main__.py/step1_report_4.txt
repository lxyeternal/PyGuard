  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing CLI options to print package info or version. It reads input from command-line arguments and writes output to stdout. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input processing beyond basic argument checking, and no suspicious behaviors such as network activity or data leakage. The code appears purely informational, serving as an entrypoint script for CLI operations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a simple informational purpose, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
