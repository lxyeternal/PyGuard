  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version.\n- It imports only `sys`.\n- It defines two functions: `print_info()` and `print_version()`, which output hardcoded strings.\n- The `main()` function checks for `--version` in `sys.argv` and calls the appropriate function.\n- No external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None. The code is benign, static, and well-structured.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None, except perhaps a very minimal security risk associated with command-line argument handling, which is standard here.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n- All describe the code as a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security issues are identified.\n- Confidence is high (1.0), and all agree on benign nature.\n- Malware score is 0, which is correct.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- Security risk is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar assessment: straightforward, no malicious activity.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), but given the code's simplicity, this is probably overestimating.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n- Obfuscated score is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  - **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n  - **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n  - **Risk:** The first four reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The fifth assigns 0.1, which is slightly higher but still low. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score of 0.0 would be more justified.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  - No. All reports correctly identify the code as static, informational, and benign.\n\n- **Is the reasoning sound?**  \n  - Yes. The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Security risk:** Should be **0** across all reports, as there's no indication of risk.\n\n- **Justification for risk score of 0:**  \n  - The code does not process untrusted input beyond a simple argument check.\n  - No network, file, or external operations.\n  - No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n  - Static strings only.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores in all reports are appropriate, though the fifth report's risk score could be lowered from 0.1 to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                   | No malicious activity present                                |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk  | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected             |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed report or further analysis.",
