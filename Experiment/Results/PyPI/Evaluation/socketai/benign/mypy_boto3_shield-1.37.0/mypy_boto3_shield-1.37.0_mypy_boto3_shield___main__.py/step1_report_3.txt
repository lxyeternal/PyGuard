  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script that displays package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing leads to calling print_version() if '--version' is present, otherwise print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code only outputs static informational strings.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and executes based on command-line input. It performs simple I/O operations without processing untrusted input or executing external commands. There are no signs of malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and contains only static strings meant for user information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed for displaying package info and version. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
