  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only the `sys` module, uses straightforward functions, and performs simple argument checking.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, no file manipulations, and no handling of untrusted input beyond argument parsing.\n   - The code contains only hardcoded static strings meant for informational purposes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the code as a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues in the code justify a high risk score.\n   - The highest `securityRisk` score is 0.1, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - Malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification exists for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware scores of 0 across all reports are correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly state that the code is purely informational.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 to 0.1 — minimal, given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Final note:** The reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.",
