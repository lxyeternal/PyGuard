  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that outputs package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for printing information, sys.argv for input (arguments)",
  "flows": "Input from command-line -> decision based on '--version' -> output via sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded strings are informational, no suspicious dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that outputs package info or version. It imports sys, defines functions to print static info, and checks command-line arguments for '--version'. No untrusted data handling, no network operations, no file operations, and no code injection points are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that only outputs predefined static information. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or security risks.",
