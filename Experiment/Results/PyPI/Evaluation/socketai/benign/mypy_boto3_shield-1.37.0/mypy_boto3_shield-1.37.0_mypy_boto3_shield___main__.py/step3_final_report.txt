  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external effects.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to either printing version or info; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static strings, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs predefined static information. It imports only sys, performs minimal argument checking, and writes static strings to stdout. There are no external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is well-structured, simple, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. The lack of obfuscation and static nature further confirm its benign intent. The minimal argument handling does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is safe, with no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
