  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package that provides information about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes package info and version to stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output; sys.argv for input.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing -> condition check -> output functions (print_version or print_info).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and primarily handles CLI argument parsing and printing package information. It reads input from sys.argv, a standard and trusted source, and writes to stdout. No untrusted data handling, external network access, or malicious behavior is detected. The functions are simple, with no complex or suspicious logic, and the comments and structure are normal for a CLI script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI entrypoint script that provides package info and version. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
