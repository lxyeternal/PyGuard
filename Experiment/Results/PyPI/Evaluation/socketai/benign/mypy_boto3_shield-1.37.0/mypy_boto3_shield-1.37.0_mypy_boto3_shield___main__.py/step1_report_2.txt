  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that displays package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output messages.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information.",
  "flows": "User runs script -> checks command-line argument -> prints version or info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines functions to print package info and version. The main function checks for a command-line argument '--version' and responds accordingly. No input is taken from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no network communication, no obfuscation, and no malicious code are present. The code appears to be straightforward, serving as a CLI utility without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is safe to use.",
