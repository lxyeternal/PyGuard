  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code behavior, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely for defining static data structures for AWS Shield, with no runtime logic or data handling. It notes the absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data processing.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; the code is just type annotations and data models for AWS Shield API. No runtime or external data handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the code is purely for static type definitions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Emphasizes that the code is for static type annotations, with no runtime logic. The only minor note is that some data structures could hold untrusted data, but that is typical for type definitions.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others; the code is a set of type definitions with no execution or data handling. The mention of `Any` and `Mapping[str, Any]` is standard for flexible data structures, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code or behavior. The code is purely for static type annotations.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no runtime logic, external data handling, or code execution, the risk score remains at 0 across all reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS SDK models.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate and justified.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, purely declarative, and poses no security threat.",
