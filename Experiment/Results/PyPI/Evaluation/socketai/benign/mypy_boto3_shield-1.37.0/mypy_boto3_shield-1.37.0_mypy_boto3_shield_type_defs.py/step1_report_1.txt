  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structure specifications for AWS Shield service interactions, including request/response models, configuration types, and nested data structures.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations, imported modules, and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code primarily defines types and does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior identified. The code is standard for type annotations and structured data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises mostly import statements, conditional imports for compatibility, and extensive TypedDict class definitions for request, response, and data types related to AWS Shield. No code execution, dynamic behavior, or input handling is present. The data structures appear to be standard and are consistent with typical SDK or API data modeling practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious commands, or malicious payloads. The use of type annotations and dictionaries aligns with safe, static data definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining data types used in AWS Shield API interactions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured type definition module with no indications of supply chain attacks or malware.",
