  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports conclude that the code is purely for defining static type annotations and data structures for AWS Shield API interactions.\n- They find no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code relies on standard Python typing constructs, conditional imports for compatibility, and extensive TypedDict definitions.\n- No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, all reports agree that the code is standard type definitions.\n- **Malicious behavior or malware:** None detected, scores are 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed, scores are 0.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No, the code is static and declarative.\n- **Data flow from untrusted sources:** None, as the code only defines types.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No, the code appears well-structured and consistent.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct, the code is purely for static type annotations, with no runtime or dynamic behavior.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports are consistent and justified in their assessments.\n- The code is a typical SDK type definition module, likely auto-generated or maintained for API consistency.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the detailed reviews and the nature of the code, **my own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Aspect                | Score |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Malware               | 0.0    |\n| Obfuscated            | 0.0    |\n| Security Risk         | 0.0    |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is static, purely for type annotations, with no runtime logic or external data processing.  \n- No suspicious imports, no obfuscation techniques, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- The use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.  \n- All data structures are straightforward representations of API models.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk categories.",
