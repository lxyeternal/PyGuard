{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions and data models for AWS Shield SDK interactions, primarily using TypedDict and type annotations for API request and response structures.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, TypedDict definitions, conditional imports for compatibility, and data structure declarations.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data handling or external data processing; only static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows at runtime; the code defines data shapes used elsewhere in the SDK.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; standard use of conditional imports and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining data structures for AWS Shield API interactions. It contains no executable logic, no data processing, and no external data handling. The use of 'Any' and 'Mapping[str, Any]' is typical for flexible data models. Conditional imports for Python version compatibility are standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are justified based on the static, well-structured nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of static type definitions for AWS SDK models. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is safe for supply chain use. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are accurate and appropriate.",
