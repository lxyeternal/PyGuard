  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for AWS Shield service SDK, providing structured data types for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, and TypedDict class declarations reading static type annotations and constants.",
  "sinks": "None directly indicating untrusted data handling or external system interaction. No network or file I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is solely type definition and annotation without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code uses standard Python type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and clear documentation. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type annotations for the AWS Shield SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It defines TypedDict classes for request and response data, including nested structures. There are no runtime operations, no data handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are present. The code is purely declarative for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard, well-structured type definitions and annotations intended for static type checking of the AWS SDK for Python. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The likelihood of malicious intent is negligible.",
