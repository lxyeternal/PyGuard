{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for the AWS Shield service in Python, primarily used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Sources include imported modules (`sys`, `datetime`, `typing`, `typing_extensions`, `builtins`) and string literals from `.literals` for type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data structures that can hold untrusted data, such as `Dict[str, Any]`, `Mapping[str, Any]`, and input parameters that accept user or external input, e.g., resource ARNs, IDs, and configuration options.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (like ARNs, IDs, configurations) into data structures and type definitions; no execution or external data handling occurs. The code is purely static type annotation without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are observed. The code strictly defines data types and imports necessary modules for typing. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. The import of `sys` for version checks is standard; no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type definitions using Python's `TypedDict`, `Union`, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It imports literals and type annotations that are used to define the structure of AWS Shield API responses and requests. The code does not perform any data processing, external calls, or execute logic beyond static type annotations. The use of `NotRequired` from `typing_extensions` aligns with modern Python type practices. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are present. The inclusion of `Any` in `Dict[str, Any]` and `Mapping[str, Any]` is typical for flexible data structures but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static analysis, documentation, and type checking of the AWS Shield SDK in Python. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
