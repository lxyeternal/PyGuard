  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, inconsistencies in scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is solely type definitions for AWS Shield, with no dynamic or runtime logic.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified as the code is static type annotations.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The code is standard for SDK type definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate scoring; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code is purely for static type annotations with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct evaluation; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is for static type definitions, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are 0, matching the code's purpose.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlighting the code is for static type annotations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no modifications required.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes potential sinks like `Dict[str, Any]`, but clarifies these are for static type annotations and data structures, not runtime data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation; standard type definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, declarative nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-executable, type definition-only code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is purely for static type annotations, data structure definitions, and SDK modeling.\n- No dynamic code, external data processing, or runtime logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The conditional imports for compatibility are standard practice and do not introduce risk.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are accurate and justified. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores or assessments are necessary. The reports are consistent with the nature of the code.",
