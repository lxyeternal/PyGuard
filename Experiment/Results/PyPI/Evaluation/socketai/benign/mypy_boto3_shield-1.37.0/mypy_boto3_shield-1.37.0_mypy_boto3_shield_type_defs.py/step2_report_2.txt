  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to identify any inconsistencies, potential risks, or overlooked issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely for defining data structures and type annotations for AWS Shield interactions. No runtime logic, data handling, or external processing is present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are correctly set to 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is evident.\n- **Security Risk:** Appropriately zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. The code is benign, purely for static type definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is described as type annotations for AWS Shield, with no evidence of malicious activity. The reasoning about the absence of runtime data handling or external data processing is sound.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations with conditional imports for compatibility. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report notes that the code is for static type annotations, with no runtime data handling or external interactions. The use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Correctly 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The only notable point is that the report mentions potential sinks—`Dict[str, Any]`, `Mapping[str, Any]`, and input parameters like ARNs and IDs—that could hold untrusted data. However, since this code only defines types and does not process or handle data at runtime, these are merely data structures, not execution points.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly 0.\n- **Security Risk:** While the report hints at potential data injection points, the code itself does not perform any processing, so the risk remains negligible.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is thorough and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code's static nature and purpose justify the low risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or payload.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward type definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, justified by the code's static, non-executable nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK models. It contains no executable logic, no data processing, no external calls, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
