{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for AWS Shield service responses and requests to facilitate static type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and data structure definitions; imports of standard libraries, third-party type extensions, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or externalized; the code only defines data structures for API communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to type annotations and data structure definitions; no runtime data processing or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly provides data structure definitions using TypedDict, Union, and type annotations for AWS Shield API models. There are no runtime behaviors, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. All imports are for type hinting and compatibility; no malicious libraries or code execution is present. The structure appears to be auto-generated or standardized for SDK purposes. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic. The code does not contain any network calls, eval, exec, or file manipulations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type definitions for AWS Shield SDK models, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. It is intended solely for static type checking and API data modeling, presenting no security risks.",
