  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Shield service data structures and request/response types.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions, builtins), external literals, and the code itself defining TypedDicts and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no execution or untrusted data handling is implemented in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines data structures without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Shield API data structures using Python's typing system. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, extensive TypedDicts, type aliases, and no executable logic. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious code, or external data handling that could pose a security risk. All data structures appear to be straightforward representations of API inputs and outputs. The code is well-structured, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for AWS SDK structures. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use as part of type checking and documentation.",
