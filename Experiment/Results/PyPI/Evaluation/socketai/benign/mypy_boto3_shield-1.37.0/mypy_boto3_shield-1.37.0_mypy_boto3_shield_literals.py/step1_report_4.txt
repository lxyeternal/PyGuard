  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS Shield service configurations and identifiers using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Literal assignments for each type, importing Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is purely for type annotations and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS Shield literals, including version-based import handling. It only defines constants and types for documentation and type checking purposes. No runtime logic, data processing, or external communication present that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The structure and content are straightforward and aligned with standard type annotation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of type annotations and documentation links for AWS Shield service literals. No malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
