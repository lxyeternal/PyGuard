{
  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS Shield resource identifiers and configurations to facilitate type safety and documentation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments of Literal types; conditional import of Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no runtime data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "None; static type annotations without data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, consisting of type alias definitions for string literals used in AWS Shield and related services. It conditionally imports 'Literal' for compatibility, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is to serve as type annotations and documentation support, which is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type annotation module for AWS SDK resource identifiers. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
