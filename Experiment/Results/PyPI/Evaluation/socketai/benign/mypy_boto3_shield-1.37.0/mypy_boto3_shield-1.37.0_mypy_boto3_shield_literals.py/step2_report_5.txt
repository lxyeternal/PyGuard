  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS Shield parameters, primarily for type safety and documentation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, consisting solely of type annotations and constants. No runtime logic, data processing, or external calls. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0. The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining resource types and actions for AWS Shield.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type definitions with no dynamic behavior or external interactions. No malicious indicators.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for boto3_shield service configuration, with conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime logic or data handling. All literals are static, serving as type annotations.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is correct; the code is purely for static typing.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, for AWS Shield literals, with version-based import handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic or malicious behavior; standard pattern for type annotations.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for AWS Shield configurations, with standard import handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, declarative type aliases; no runtime or external operations.\n- **Risk Assessment:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a collection of static type annotations for AWS service literals.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and align with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (negligible, as purely static type annotations)\n\nThis code is a standard, benign static type definition module for AWS SDKs, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** No modifications needed. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose for static type checking and documentation.",
