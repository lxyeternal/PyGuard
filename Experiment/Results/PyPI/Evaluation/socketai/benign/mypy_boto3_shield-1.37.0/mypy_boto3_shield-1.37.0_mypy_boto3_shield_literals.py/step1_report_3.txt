  "purpose": "Define string literal types for boto3_shield service configuration and identifiers using type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and assignments of Literal types for various constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data usage observed; all literals are predefined static strings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code only assigns static literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors; standard pattern for type annotations with conditional import.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various string literal types used in boto3_shield. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is a common pattern. All literals are static string constants defining types or identifiers, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or data processing. No obfuscation or suspicious code is present. The overall structure is typical for type annotations and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward, non-malicious collection of type annotations for boto3_shield literals. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It serves as a static type definition file for type checking and documentation purposes.",
