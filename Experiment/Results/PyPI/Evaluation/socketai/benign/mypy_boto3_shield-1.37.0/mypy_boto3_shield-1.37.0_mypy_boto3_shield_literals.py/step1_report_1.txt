{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various AWS Shield service parameters and identifiers, primarily for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables representing types, imports from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', and the module's initial docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only defines types and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not handle runtime data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of type annotations and constant definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, then defines multiple Literal types for AWS service identifiers and parameters. There are no functions, runtime logic, network operations, or data processing. The purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of type annotations for AWS Shield service literals. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for type safety in SDKs. The overall security risk is negligible.",
