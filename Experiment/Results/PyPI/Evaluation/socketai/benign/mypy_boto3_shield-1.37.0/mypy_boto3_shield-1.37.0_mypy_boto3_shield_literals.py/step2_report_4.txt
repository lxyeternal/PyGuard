  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines multiple string literal types using `Literal[...]` for various AWS Shield service parameters, resource identifiers, and related constants.\n- It imports `Literal` conditionally based on Python version (>=3.12 from `typing`, else from `typing_extensions`).\n- The module contains no functions, no runtime logic, no data processing, no network calls, or external inputs.\n- It is purely for static type checking, documentation, and code clarity.\n- No secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and only contains static type annotations and constants.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The implementation follows standard patterns for type annotations, with appropriate version handling.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  All reports correctly assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`. The code does not perform any malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the code's static, read-only nature.\n\n- **Logic and Reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for type safety, documentation, and does not process untrusted data or perform any runtime operations.\n\n- **Potential assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is accurate.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Overall security assessment:**  \n  The code is a benign, static type definition module. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Additional notes:**  \n  The code's purpose is purely for static analysis and documentation support in SDKs or type-checked codebases.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of this code. No changes needed. The overall security risk is negligible.",
