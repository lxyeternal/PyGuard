  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, then synthesize an overall security risk estimate.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports agree that the code is solely defining static type annotations for AWS Shield and related resources, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code Content:**  \n  The code consists exclusively of `Literal` type alias definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation strings. No functions, network calls, data handling, or secrets are present.\n\n- **Purpose & Logic:**  \n  The purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation, which is standard practice in SDKs and type annotations.\n\n- **Behavior & Data Flow:**  \n  No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic or runtime behavior.\n\n- **Anomalies & Malicious Indicators:**  \n  No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware & Security Risks:**  \n  The reports correctly identify the absence of malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.  \n  The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`) are appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex constructs.  \n  The `obfuscated: 0` score is justified.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n  The reports challenge no claims of vulnerabilities; given the static nature of the code, this is correct.\n\n- **Score Reasonableness:**  \n  All reports assign maximum confidence (`confidence: 1`) and zero risk, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** They correctly identify that this is a benign, static type annotation module with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n  No malicious activity or code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n  Clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0**  \n  No security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign type annotation module for AWS SDKs. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is purely for static analysis and documentation purposes.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
