  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS Shield service and related resource identifiers for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables representing various AWS resource types and actions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only defines type annotations and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward type definitions with no dynamic code execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Literal for AWS resource names, actions, and status indicators, conditioned on Python version. It imports from standard modules, and all definitions are static. There are no data input/output operations, no external calls, or dynamic code execution. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a benign module solely for type safety and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type annotation module for AWS Shield and related resources. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. No security risks or suspicious activity detected.",
