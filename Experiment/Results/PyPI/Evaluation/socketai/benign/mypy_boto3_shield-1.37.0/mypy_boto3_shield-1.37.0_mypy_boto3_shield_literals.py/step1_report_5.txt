  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS Shield service configurations and identifiers to support type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code mainly defines constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; type annotations are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward type alias definitions with no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type alias definitions using Literal types for various AWS Shield and resource-related identifiers. It conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. No secrets or credentials are embedded. The content is purely declarative type hints meant for static analysis and documentation. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
