  "purpose": "Main interface for shield service providing access to ShieldClient and related paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and defines an alias.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward module setup without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports classes from local modules and exposes an alias and __all__ list. No user input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs here. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose appears to be to organize and expose parts of a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a clean interface module that doesn't process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
