{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface to the AWS Shield service with documentation and import definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, module-level variable definitions, and docstring for usage.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. The docstring includes a URL but nothing malicious or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module-level docstring, import statements from internal modules, and assignment of a class to a variable for export. No external input handling, network activity, or code execution occurs here. The docstring references external documentation and provides usage examples. The code adheres to standard module structure and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module interface for AWS Shield, containing no malicious or suspicious content. It appears to be a standard, benign wrapper with no security risks.",
