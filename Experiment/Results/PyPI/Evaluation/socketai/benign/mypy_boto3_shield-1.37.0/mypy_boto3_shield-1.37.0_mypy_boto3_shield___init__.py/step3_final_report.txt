{
  "purpose": "A minimal interface module for AWS Shield SDK components, importing classes and exposing them via aliases and __all__.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.client and .paginator), static documentation, no external inputs or data flows.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign module that imports classes from local modules, assigns an alias, and defines an __all__ list. It contains static documentation with usage examples. No external inputs, network activity, or data processing occurs. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All signals indicate a benign, structural SDK interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is entirely benign, serving as a simple, safe interface layer for AWS Shield SDK components. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
