  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module that imports classes from local modules and exposes them via aliases and __all__.\n- No external input, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard interface or wrapper for AWS Shield SDK components.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unlikely to be malicious but could be outdated or a placeholder.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis that this is a benign interface module.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty in the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025). While not malicious, it could suggest outdated documentation or placeholder text, but this does not impact security.\n- No report suggests any code that could be exploited or that performs dangerous actions.\n\n**Scores validation:**\n- Malware: 0 is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is appropriate.\n- Risk: 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured module that acts as an interface for AWS Shield SDK components.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The documentation and code structure are standard.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is entirely benign, serving as a simple organizational interface within a larger SDK. No security risks or malicious behaviors are present.",
