{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-shield package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setup from setuptools, reads package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description -> supplies metadata and dependencies to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads a local markdown file, defines package metadata, and calls setup() from setuptools to package the module. All actions are standard for Python package setup. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are involved. The dependencies are clearly specified with environment markers, and the code appears to be a typical setup configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs common setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
