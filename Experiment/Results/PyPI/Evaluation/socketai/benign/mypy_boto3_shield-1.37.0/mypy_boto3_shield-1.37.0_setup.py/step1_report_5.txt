  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-shield', used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory to load 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points; all static data used for setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for long description, then passes static arguments to 'setup()' for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It imports Path for file handling, reads the README.md for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. All data used are hardcoded or read from local files. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The script appears to be a typical package configuration file with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no hidden code, and no security risks. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
