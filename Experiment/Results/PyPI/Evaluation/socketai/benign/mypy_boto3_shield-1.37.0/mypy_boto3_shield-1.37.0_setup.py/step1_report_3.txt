  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the mypy-boto3-shield Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads a local file 'README.md' for documentation purposes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' -> assigned to LONG_DESCRIPTION -> used in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a documentation file, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious logic is evident. The dependencies and URLs are public and legitimate. The script appears to be a standard package setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script without malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It only reads a local README file and supplies metadata to setuptools. No suspicious activity is detected.",
