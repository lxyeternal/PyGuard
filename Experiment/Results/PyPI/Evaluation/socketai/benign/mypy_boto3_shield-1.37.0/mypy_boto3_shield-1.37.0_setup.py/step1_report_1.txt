{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-shield package to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools for packaging, and static string assignments for package info.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or potential data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static data is used for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. The script strictly defines package setup details.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools, reads a static README.md file, and passes fixed metadata to setup(). No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution observed. All code appears standard for a Python package setup script. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
