  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-shield package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; static data used, no untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read into setup() parameters; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that imports Path and setuptools.setup, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All signals indicate benign, typical packaging code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and accurate.",
