  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a typical setup.py script with no suspicious or malicious activity. It correctly identifies that the script reads a static README.md file, imports setuptools, and passes fixed metadata to setup(). No dynamic or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code content.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here. The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the script's standard nature, with no suspicious logic or data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the script is a standard setup script with no anomalies, no dynamic code, or external data sources.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, confirms standard packaging code with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also consistent with previous analyses, describing the script as a straightforward setup configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is a standard setup script with no dynamic behavior, no external inputs, or suspicious logic, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script, involving reading a local README.md file and passing static metadata to setuptools. It does not involve any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling from untrusted sources.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and free from security issues.",
