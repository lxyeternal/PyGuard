  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS Shield service in boto3, enabling type-safe interactions with AWS Shield's API.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of method signatures, property declarations, and type annotations; no runtime input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations are placeholders without actual logic; no direct untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions detected in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or execution logic; this is purely interface and type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward and typical for type stub files.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions, property declarations, method signatures with type annotations, and docstrings referencing external documentation. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. All functions are stubs meant for type checking and code completion. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or network communication are evident. The structure aligns with standard SDK stub files for type safety, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-executable interface definition for AWS SDKs, providing type annotations and documentation references. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
