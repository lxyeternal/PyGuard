{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS Shield service, facilitating type-safe interactions with the AWS Shield API via boto3.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, type annotations, method signatures, docstrings, and property definitions within the ShieldClient class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines type annotations and method signatures without executing untrusted data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not implement runtime data flows but provides an API interface with method signatures and type hints.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive type definitions and method signatures but no actual runtime code or data processing logic. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type stub for the AWS Shield client, including method signatures, property definitions, exception classes, and type annotations. It references external documentation for AWS SDK methods but does not perform any data processing, network calls, or logic that could be malicious. The use of 'Unpack' and detailed type definitions enhances type safety and code clarity. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a legitimate interface layer for AWS Shield with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign type stub and interface definition for the AWS Shield client, containing no executable logic, malicious code, or security risks. It is designed solely for type safety and API documentation purposes.",
