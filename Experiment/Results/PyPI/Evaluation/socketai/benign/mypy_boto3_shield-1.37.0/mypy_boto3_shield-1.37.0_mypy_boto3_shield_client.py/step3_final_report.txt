{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for AWS Shield client, serving as static SDK stubs for development and type safety.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, import statements, property declarations.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, no execution of untrusted code, only method signatures passing parameters to external API calls.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow into API calls; no internal data processing or logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static interface/stub for the boto3 Shield client, containing only class and method signatures with documentation links. It does not execute any logic or handle data internally. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or runtime code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its static, non-executable nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface stub with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, static definition used for development purposes.",
