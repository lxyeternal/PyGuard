  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the potential security implications, correctness, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as type annotations and client interface for AWS Shield, with no runtime logic.\n- **Sources:** Reads class definitions, method signatures, imports.\n- **Sinks:** No direct data leaks or execution of untrusted code.\n- **Flows:** Data from method parameters into API calls, but no actual logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a static interface/stub, serving as type annotations for safer development. No runtime code, no network activity, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK stub; no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, type annotations for boto3 Shield client.\n- **Sources:** Import statements, class, method signatures.\n- **Sinks:** No direct handling of untrusted data or code execution.\n- **Flows:** Method args flow into API calls, but no actual implementation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Analysis:** Pure interface, no runtime logic, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK stub.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, type annotations for AWS Shield.\n- **Sources:** Static definitions, method signatures.\n- **Sinks:** No runtime data processing or external calls.\n- **Flows:** Interface definitions only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Legitimate SDK interface, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, non-executable stub.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar SDK interface definitions.\n- **Sources:** Class definitions, method signatures.\n- **Sinks:** No actual data handling or execution.\n- **Flows:** Pure interface, no runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK stub.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and interface for AWS Shield, used for managing resources.\n- **Sources:** Imports, method signatures, property declarations.\n- **Sinks:** Methods involve parameters and responses, but no direct execution.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from method args to API calls; no code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The code is primarily interface/stub, with no runtime logic or external code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.1\n\n**Justification for risk score:**  \nWhile the code is benign, the report assigns a small risk score (0.1), likely reflecting the fact that the code involves API interactions that could, in a different context, be exploited if misused. However, since this is a static interface/stub with no runtime logic, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Malware score:**  \n0.0 is appropriate, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports are about static SDK interface/stub code with no runtime logic, no data processing, no external code execution.\n- **Malware risk:** 0.0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated code:** 0.0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Overall security risk:** Very low, primarily because these are interface definitions, not executable code.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 — minimal, reflecting the nature of the code as a static SDK stub, not actual runtime code.\n\n**Final note:** These are type annotations and interface definitions, serving as static aids for development, not executable logic. They pose no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with benign SDK stub code. No modifications to scores are necessary. The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and the minimal risk score appropriately reflects its static, non-executable nature.",
