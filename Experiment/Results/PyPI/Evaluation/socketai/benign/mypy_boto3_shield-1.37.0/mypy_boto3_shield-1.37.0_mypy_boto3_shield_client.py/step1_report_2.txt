  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 Shield client, facilitating type-checked interaction with AWS Shield service.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property declarations that define the API surface.",
  "sinks": "Methods that accept untrusted input via **kwargs and pass them directly to AWS API calls; no direct data handling or processing is visible.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from method arguments (kwargs) flows into AWS API calls via method signatures with unpacked request type definitions, but actual implementations are not shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as code execution, network connections, or hidden backdoors, are present. Use of type annotations and documentation links suggests standard SDK interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a well-structured interface for AWS Shield client with type annotations and method signatures. All methods are standard API wrappers with no visible logic, only interface definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are apparent. The code heavily relies on external SDKs and type definitions, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious constructs. The structure and comments align with typical SDK stub files. No anomalous behaviors or hidden functionalities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation and interface stub for the boto3 Shield client, designed for type safety and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. It is safe and intended for SDK type checking.",
