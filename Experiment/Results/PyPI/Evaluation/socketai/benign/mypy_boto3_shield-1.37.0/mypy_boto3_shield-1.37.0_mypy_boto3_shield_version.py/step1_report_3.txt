  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\"",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not handle untrusted input or output",
  "flows": "The code sets a version string, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; simple version assignment, no suspicious or unusual code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, which is a common practice in Python modules. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no external data sources or sinks. The only notable element is the comment indicating a source of truth for versioning and the copyright notice. The code is static, straightforward, and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not pose security risks.",
