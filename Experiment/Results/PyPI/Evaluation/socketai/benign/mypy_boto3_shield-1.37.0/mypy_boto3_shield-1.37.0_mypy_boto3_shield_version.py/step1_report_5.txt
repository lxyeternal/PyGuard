  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable and includes a copyright comment. No input handling, environment variable use, or dynamic code execution. The presence of a future copyright year is suspicious but not harmful; it could be an error or intentional placeholder. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with a copyright comment. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
