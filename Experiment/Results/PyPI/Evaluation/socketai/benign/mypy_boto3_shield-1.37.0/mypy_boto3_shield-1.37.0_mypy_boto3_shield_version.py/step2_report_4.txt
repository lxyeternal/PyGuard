  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a very simple code snippet: assigning a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is standard practice for Python modules.\n- The only unusual element is the copyright year \"2025\" which is in the future relative to the current date (October 2023). This is not malicious but could be a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No significant errors. The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring review:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is not obfuscated.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Confidence scores:**  \n  All are at 1, which is reasonable given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The **future copyright year (2025)** is noted as unusual but not malicious. It could be a typo, placeholder, or intentional future date. It does not impact security but could be flagged for correctness or documentation purposes.\n\n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The current scores seem appropriate and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  Since the code is static and straightforward, there's no need to adjust malware or risk scores. The only minor note is the future year, which is not a security concern but might warrant correction or clarification.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the current assessments. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
