  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '__version__' to '1.37.0'; comment with copyright notice.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' is in the future relative to current date, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string, with a comment containing a future year. No dynamic code, input handling, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The future year is an anomaly but not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.",
