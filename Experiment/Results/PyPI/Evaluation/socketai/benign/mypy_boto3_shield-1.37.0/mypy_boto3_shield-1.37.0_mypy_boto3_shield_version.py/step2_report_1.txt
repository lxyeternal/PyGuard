  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The only unusual element is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current dates (assuming current year is 2024). This is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and matches the description. No issues or anomalies in the code logic.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; scores of 0 for malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; scores of 0.\n- **Security risk:** None; scores of 0.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1 or 1.0, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n- The only point of note is the future year \"2025\" in the comment, which is not malicious but could be considered an anomaly. However, the reports correctly classify it as benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or errors:\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and without malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional note:** The future copyright year is unusual but not malicious. It might be worth flagging for review in a real security context, but given the current evidence, it doesn't impact the security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no changes necessary.",
