  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable with a copyright comment. There are no external input sources, no data leaks, no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscated code. The code is standard for Python modules to declare their version. It is straightforward and contains no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is benign and standard practice in Python modules.",
