  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - No external inputs, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources, no sinks, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code is a standard version declaration pattern used widely in Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The only minor point is the mention of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious—possibly an error or placeholder.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments are zero, and the code is straightforward, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is zero in all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The mention of the future copyright year is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The current scores are appropriate.",
