  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources or to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies detected. The comment is a standard header.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment indicating the source of truth for versioning, a copyright notice, and a single variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.0'. No input, external data, or dynamic code execution occurs. The static version string appears legitimate and typical for version management. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
