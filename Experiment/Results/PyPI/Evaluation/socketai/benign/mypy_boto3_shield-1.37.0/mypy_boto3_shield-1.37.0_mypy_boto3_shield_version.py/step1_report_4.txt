  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a module-level docstring and a single assignment of the version string to __version__. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious code structures. The version is hardcoded as '1.37.0', with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. The copyright comment is unrelated to code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
