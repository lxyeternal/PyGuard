  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence or absence of issues, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- The code is standard for Python modules, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data sources.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). While unusual, this is not malicious or a security concern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The code is a simple variable assignment:\n  ```python\n  __version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n  ```\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- The code is benign and typical for version declaration.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only potential issue is the future copyright year \"2025.\"\n- This could be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security or functionality.\n- No other errors or security flaws are present.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **reasoning** in each report is sound: the code is standard, simple, and free of suspicious behavior.\n- The **confidence** scores are 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The **anomalies** noted (future year) are minor and do not warrant higher risk scores.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **scores** are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n- The **only minor note** is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is standard, with no malicious indicators. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- Consider correcting the copyright year if necessary, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Work through complete, step-by-step:**\n- Confirmed code matches description.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n- Anomaly (future year) is not security relevant.\n\n**Final verdict:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign.",
