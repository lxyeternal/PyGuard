  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code consists solely of a comment and a single assignment:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n- No input handling, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- The version string is static and hardcoded.\n- The comment and copyright notice are benign.\n- The copyright year is in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, straightforward version assignment, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1.0, obfuscated=0.0, malware=0.0, securityRisk=0.0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning; no dynamic code, no input/output, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion. Mentions only a simple assignment and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Notes the future copyright year (2025) as unusual but not malicious. No code behavior indicating malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Code is benign, straightforward, and standard for version declaration.**\n- **No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators.**\n- **Future copyright year is suspicious but not malicious.**\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the scores assigned in all reports are consistent and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical version string declaration with no security concerns. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the scores; all reports are accurate and aligned with the code content.",
