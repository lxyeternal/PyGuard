{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to build and install a Python extension module for PyQt5 using C source files.",
  "sources": "Reads all C source files in the current directory using glob.glob('*.c')",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; primarily filesystem reads and setup procedures",
  "flows": "Reads C files from filesystem -> passes file list to Extension -> setup uses extension module",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed; standard build script",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, gathers C source files, and configures a build for a Python extension module. No user input handling, no network operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. It appears to be a typical build script for a Python C extension, specifically for PyQt5's SIP module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for building a C extension module for Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply automates the compilation of C sources into a Python extension as part of a package build process.",
