  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, which is a straightforward setup script for building a Python C extension module.\n- The code uses `glob.glob('*.c')` to locate C source files, then passes them to `Extension` and `setup()` for compilation.\n- No reports identify any suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The code is standard for building C extensions in Python projects.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports find any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Input handling:** The only input is the list of C source files obtained via `glob`, which is a normal build process.\n- **Potential concerns:** The only minor concern could be if malicious C files are present in the directory, but that is outside the scope of this script's security—it's a typical build process.\n- **Future date (2025):** The copyright date is in the future, likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: mostly 0.1 or 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The overall risk scores are very low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The security risk score should be very low, around 0 or 0.1, as the reports suggest.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's a typical build script with minimal risk, mainly potential concern if malicious source files are added later)\n\n**Final note:** No evidence suggests any malicious activity or security vulnerability in this code as presented.",
