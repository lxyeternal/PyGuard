{
  "purpose": "Builds a Python C extension module named 'PyQt5.sip' by compiling all '.c' source files in the current directory.",
  "sources": "Filesystem globbing for '*.c' files using glob.glob('*.c')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script compiles source files without executing or transmitting data",
  "flows": "Source files located via glob.glob() are passed directly to Extension for compilation without further data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward setup script. The copyright year 2025 is in the future, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard build process for a Python C extension, using glob to locate source files and setuptools to compile them. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The only minor concern is the future year, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and typical for such build processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious setup script for building a Python extension module. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low security risk score reflects the minimal inherent risk, primarily associated with potential malicious source files introduced externally, not with the script itself.",
