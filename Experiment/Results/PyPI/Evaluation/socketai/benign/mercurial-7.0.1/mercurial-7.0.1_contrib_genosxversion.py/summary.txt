  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for version normalization and comparison, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The reliance on external 'hg' command introduces minimal environmental risk, but this is standard in such tools. The overall security risk is low, and the code is safe to use in trusted environments."
