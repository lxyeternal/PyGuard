  "purpose": "Manage demand-loading (lazy import) of modules for Mercurial, including platform-specific adjustments and environment variable controls.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('CHGINTERNALMARK', 'HGDEMANDIMPORT'), static module ignore list, platform detection via sys.builtin_module_names.",
  "sinks": "Demandimport enable/disable functions, platform-specific module handling, environment variable checks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence demandimport.enable() calls; platform detection modifies ignore list; demandimport functions control module loading behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and configuration-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module for demand-loading management, with environment variables controlling activation, platform-specific ignore list adjustments, and re-exported control functions. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The logic is transparent, and the code is well-structured. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The environment variable checks are typical for configuration, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard utility for demand-loading in Python, and the scores should reflect this. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
