  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured lazy import mechanism intended for performance enhancement. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse for delaying or intercepting imports, but no malicious activity is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero potential for misuse."
