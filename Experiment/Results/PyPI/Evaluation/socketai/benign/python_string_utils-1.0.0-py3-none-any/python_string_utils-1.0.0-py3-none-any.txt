      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused collection of functions with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments across multiple reports are consistent and accurate. The minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by the use of randomness, which does not pose a security threat. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is very strong, and it can be considered safe for use."

The security risk score is appropriately low, and malware score is zero. Overall, the code is safe and standard."
