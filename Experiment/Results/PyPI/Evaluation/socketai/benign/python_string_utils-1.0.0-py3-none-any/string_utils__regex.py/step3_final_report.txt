  "purpose": "A collection of regex patterns for validation and parsing of URLs, emails, credit cards, UUIDs, IP addresses, HTML, and text formats.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern definitions compiled into re objects, static pattern strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external inputs, or dynamic processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static pattern definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely declarative with well-structured regex patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of precompiled regex patterns for common data formats. There is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. Patterns are standard and serve validation purposes. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are evident. The code is a benign utility module. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with its static, validation-only nature. No issues or malicious behavior are detected. The patterns are straightforward, and the code does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static collection of regex patterns intended for validation and parsing. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
