{
  "purpose": "Define various regular expressions for parsing URLs, emails, credentials, and text formatting for use in data validation, extraction, or sanitization.",
  "sources": "Static regex pattern definitions, hardcoded regex patterns, dictionaries with regex for credit card validation, UUIDs, IP addresses, etc.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes or outputs untrusted data; it only defines regex patterns.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; the code solely establishes regex patterns for potential use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple regex patterns for sensitive data types (credit cards, UUIDs, IPs) indicates potential for data validation or extraction, but no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of regex pattern definitions for URL, email, credit card, UUID, IP addresses, and text formatting. No code execution, data processing, network calls, or environment variable use is present. The patterns themselves do not exhibit malicious intent; they serve as static validation or parsing tools. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. The use of regex for credential or sensitive data validation is standard practice. No backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only regex pattern definitions intended for data validation and parsing. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are present. It is a benign utility module for regex patterns.",
