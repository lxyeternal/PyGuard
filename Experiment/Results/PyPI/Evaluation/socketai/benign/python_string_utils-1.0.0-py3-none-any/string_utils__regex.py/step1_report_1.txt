{
  "purpose": "The code defines a collection of regular expressions for pattern matching, validation, and data parsing tasks, such as URLs, emails, credit card numbers, UUIDs, IP addresses, and text formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads static regex patterns defined as constants and compiled regex objects. It does not process external input data directly.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writing, or system commands are present. No dynamic code execution or external data handling is implemented.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares regex patterns and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The regex patterns are extensive and include URL, email, credit card, UUID, IP, and HTML pattern matching. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or code that processes untrusted data dynamically. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a static collection of regex pattern definitions used for validation or parsing tasks. It does not include functions, data processing, or external input handling that could be exploited. The patterns are standard and appear to serve data validation purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and there are no signs of code intended for sabotage or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility component providing regex patterns for data validation and parsing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code's purpose is safe, and it does not pose security risks in its current form.",
