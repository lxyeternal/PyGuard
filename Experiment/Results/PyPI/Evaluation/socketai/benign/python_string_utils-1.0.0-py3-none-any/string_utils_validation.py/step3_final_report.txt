  "purpose": "Validation functions for various data formats such as URLs, emails, UUIDs, IP addresses, ISBNs, JSON, and text properties, relying on regex patterns and string processing.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching, string splitting, json.loads, and input validation checks.",
  "sinks": "Regex matching functions, json parsing, and exception raising for invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated via regex or parsing functions; no external data transfer or system modification occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Dependence on external regex patterns imported from '. _regex', which could potentially contain malicious or obfuscated regex patterns if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation tasks with clear structure and exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present. The only external dependency, the regex patterns, could be a vector if malicious, but this cannot be confirmed from the provided code. The functions are straightforward and do not include obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility library with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary concern is the external regex patterns, which could be malicious if compromised, but within the scope of the provided code, it is safe.",
