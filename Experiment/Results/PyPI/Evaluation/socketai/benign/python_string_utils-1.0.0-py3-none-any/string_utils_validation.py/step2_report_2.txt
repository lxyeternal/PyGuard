  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports indicate that the code is primarily a validation library relying on regex patterns, string processing, and exception handling.\n   - No reports mention any direct malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors within the provided code.\n   - The only external dependency concern is the imported regex patterns from `. _regex`, which are not visible here.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No logical errors or mistakes are identified across the reports.\n   - The functions appear to perform standard validation tasks correctly.\n   - Exception handling is limited but appropriate for validation purposes.\n   - No issues with the flow or security implications are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and low security risks (mostly below 0.5).\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature as a validation utility, assuming external regex patterns are safe.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2, indicating a low security concern.\n   - The primary potential risk is the external regex patterns, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is outside the scope of the provided code.\n   - Given the information, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified unless the external regex patterns are malicious, which cannot be determined here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent, focusing instead on the code's observable behavior.\n   - The only speculative point is the external regex patterns, which are acknowledged but not confirmed malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n   - The overall security assessment is that the code is benign, with minimal risk primarily dependent on external regex patterns.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 (very low, primarily due to external dependencies, which are outside the code scope)\n\n**My Personal Estimate**:\n\nGiven the detailed reviews and the nature of the code:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (benign validation functions)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security Risk**: 0.2 (minimal, assuming external regex patterns are safe)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code appears to be a standard, well-structured validation utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The primary concern remains the external regex patterns, which are outside the scope of this code snippet.",
