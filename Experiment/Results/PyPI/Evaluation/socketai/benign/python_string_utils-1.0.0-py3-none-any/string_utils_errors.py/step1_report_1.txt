  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for invalid input errors related to type checking.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the InvalidInputError class, specifically the input_data parameter and type_name extraction.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only constructs and raises an exception message.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to the constructor, type is checked, and a message is generated. No data flow to external systems or untrusted sources occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom error class inheriting from TypeError, intended to signal invalid input types. The constructor dynamically generates an error message based on the actual type of the provided input. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be straightforward, focusing solely on exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
