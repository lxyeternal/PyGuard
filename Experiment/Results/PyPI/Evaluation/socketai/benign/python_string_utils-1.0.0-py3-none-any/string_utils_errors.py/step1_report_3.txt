{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom error class for handling invalid input types, specifically when the input is not a string.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, type annotations, and the initialization method for the InvalidInputError class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data; the class simply constructs an error message based on input data type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with standard class and method definitions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from TypeError, with an initializer that creates an error message based on the input data's type. It is a typical pattern for custom error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution, is present. The code's structure and content are simple and standard for exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data beyond standard type checking, and there are no suspicious or malicious elements.",
