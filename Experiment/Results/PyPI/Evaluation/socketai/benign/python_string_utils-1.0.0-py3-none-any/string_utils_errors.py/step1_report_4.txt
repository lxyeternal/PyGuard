{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling invalid input errors specifically related to expected string types.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) which takes any input data and determines its type.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; the code only constructs an error message.",
  "flows": "Input data is received, its type is checked, and an error message is generated for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, defining a custom error class with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'Any' type, defines a custom error class inheriting from TypeError, and customizes the constructor to generate an informative message about incorrect input types. There is no input/output handling beyond class definition, no data transmission, or external interactions. The structure is simple and typical for error class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, harmless custom exception class used to signal invalid input types. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
