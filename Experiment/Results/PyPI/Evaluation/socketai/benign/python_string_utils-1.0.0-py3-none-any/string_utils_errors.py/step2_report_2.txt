  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code to identify any discrepancies or issues.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, benign custom exception class inheriting from TypeError.\n- The code's purpose is to generate an error message when an input is not a string.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are reported or evident.\n- The logic is simple and standard for such exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The reports consistently conclude there are no issues, malware, or security risks. The code matches the original, and no anomalies are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No errors or flaws are identified in the reports. The code is correct and idiomatic for defining a custom exception class.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1.0 (or 1)\n  \n  These seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of risk and malware scores:\n\n- **Risk score (securityRisk):**  \n  Since the code only defines an exception class with no external interactions, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  There is no malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation, so malware score should be **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, so **0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The code relies on the `type()` function and string formatting, which are safe. No assumptions about external data or behaviors are made.\n\n- **Any signs of malicious intent:**  \n  None are present or suggested by the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions.** The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates for the scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
