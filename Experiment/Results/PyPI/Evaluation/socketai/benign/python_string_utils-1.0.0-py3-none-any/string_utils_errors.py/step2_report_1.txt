  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward custom exception class that inherits from `TypeError`. It constructs an error message based on the type of `input_data`.\n   - No external data handling, network activity, or data flow to untrusted sources.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No malicious code or behaviors are present.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and free of issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n   \n   **Suggestion:** Scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Given the benign nature, this is justified.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** No higher scores warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions—no code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign exception class.\n   \n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   \n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, benign custom exception class.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
