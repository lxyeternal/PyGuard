  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward, benign custom exception class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code simply constructs an error message based on input type and inherits from TypeError.\n\n2. **Code Functionality & Data Flow:**\n   - The code receives an input (`input_data`), determines its type, constructs a message, and passes it to the superclass.\n   - There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted sources or external systems.\n   - No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution mechanisms are present.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is correct and standard for defining a custom exception class.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The purpose of the code is solely to define an exception class, with no suspicious or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The code makes no assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n   - It does not process untrusted input beyond type checking, which is safe.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the analysis, the risk scores should remain very low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and security risk at 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive review, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | 0               |\n\nThis code poses no security threat.",
