{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class InvalidInputError to handle type errors specifically when input is not a string.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only the class and its constructor are defined, which process input_data passed to it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is received in the constructor, used to generate an error message, but no data flow outside the class occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a custom exception class inheriting from TypeError. The constructor formats a message based on the input_data type and passes it to the superclass. There are no external data reads, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. The implementation is standard for custom exceptions and does not contain malicious or risky code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign custom exception class designed for type validation errors. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
