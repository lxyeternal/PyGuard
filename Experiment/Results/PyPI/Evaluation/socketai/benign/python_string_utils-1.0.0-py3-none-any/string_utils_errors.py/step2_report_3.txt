  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code defines a simple custom exception class `InvalidInputError` inheriting from `TypeError`.\n   - The constructor takes any input (`input_data`), determines its type, and constructs an error message indicating the expected type (\"str\") and the actual type received.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious intent.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is purely for exception handling, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - The code does not contain malicious payloads or behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign custom exception class.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores are needed.\n\n**My Own Estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (since it's a simple exception class, but if considering potential misuse, still very low)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is harmless and serves a clear purpose in input validation.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
