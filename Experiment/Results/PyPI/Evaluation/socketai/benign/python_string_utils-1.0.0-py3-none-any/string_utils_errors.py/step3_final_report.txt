  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'InvalidInputError' that signals when an input is not a string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'input_data' received in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input 'input_data' is checked for type, and an error message is constructed; no external flows or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception inheriting from TypeError, constructing an error message based on the type of 'input_data'. It involves no external data sources, network activity, or malicious behaviors. The logic is standard and correct. The reports uniformly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as an exception class support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores correctly reflect its safe nature.",
