  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a class `InvalidInputError` inheriting from `TypeError`.\n- The constructor takes `input_data: Any`.\n- It constructs an error message indicating the expected type (\"str\") and the actual type of `input_data`.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for custom exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- **Are there any issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n- The detailed analysis supports the conclusion that the code is safe.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Are these scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The code is simple, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **No justification needed for higher scores** as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Step 5: Malware score considerations\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports.\n- **Is this accurate?**  \n  Yes. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity.\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on its structure.\n- **Are these assumptions valid?**  \n  Yes. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, these assumptions are justified.\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe custom exception class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
