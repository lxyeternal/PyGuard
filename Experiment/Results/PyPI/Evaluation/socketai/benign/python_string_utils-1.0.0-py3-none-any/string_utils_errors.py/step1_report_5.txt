{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for invalid input errors when the input is not a string.",
  "sources": "The class constructor receives 'input_data' as input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the constructor but is only used internally to generate an error message.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception 'InvalidInputError' inheriting from TypeError. It initializes with 'input_data', constructs a message indicating the expected type ('str') and the actual type received, then passes this message to the superclass constructor. No input/output from external sources, network activity, or code execution mechanisms are present. The class is typical for validation error handling and contains no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign custom exception class used for type validation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
