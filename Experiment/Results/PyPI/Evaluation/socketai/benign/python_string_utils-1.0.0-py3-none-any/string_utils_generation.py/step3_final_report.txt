{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for UUID generation, random string creation, cryptographically secure hex string generation, and Roman numeral range generation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (e.g., size, byte_count, start, stop, step), external 'roman_encode' function",
  "sinks": "Outputs return generated strings or generators; no external data sinks or leaks",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation to output functions; no external data flows or external system interactions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices: uuid4 for UUIDs, os.urandom for secure randomness, random.choice for non-cryptographic randomness, and proper input validation. The external 'roman_encode' is assumed to be a standard Roman numeral encoder. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of random.choice() is acceptable for non-security-critical purposes. The functions are straightforward, well-validated, and do not perform any external system interactions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern over non-cryptographic randomness usage. Overall, the code is secure and trustworthy.",
