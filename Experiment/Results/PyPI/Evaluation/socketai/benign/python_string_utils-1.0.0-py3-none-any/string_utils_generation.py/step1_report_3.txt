{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for generating UUIDs, random strings, secure random hex strings, and Roman numeral sequences.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'size' for random_string, 'byte_count' for secure_random_hex, 'stop', 'start', 'step' for roman_range.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write or transmit data untrusted source data to external systems; no sinks indicative of malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Parameters are validated and then used in standard library functions for data generation; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors. All functions perform standard data generation and validation tasks. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for UUID, random string, secure random hex, and Roman numeral generation, with proper validation and usage of secure and standard libraries. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The functions use common, safe techniques for their respective tasks. No external network connections, command executions, or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with proper validation and standard library usage. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. The functions serve typical purposes in application logic without security risks or malicious intent.",
