  "purpose": "Define module version and import submodules for string utility functions",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leakage points",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only performs imports and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward module initialization and imports",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, then imports all functions from three submodules: validation, manipulation, and generation. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, or obfuscated patterns. The code serves as a package initialization script to expose utility functions, with no suspicious behavior or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The code simply manages module exports without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
