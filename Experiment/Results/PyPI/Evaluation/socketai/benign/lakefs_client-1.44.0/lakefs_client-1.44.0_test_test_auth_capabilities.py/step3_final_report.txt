  "purpose": "A minimal, auto-generated unit test scaffold for the lakeFS API client model 'AuthCapabilities'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, unittest, and lakefs_client.model.auth_capabilities; placeholder comments indicating incomplete test implementation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network calls, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder comments and minimal structure; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, auto-generated test scaffold with no logic, data handling, or network activity. It contains no malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is to serve as a template for future tests, and it does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard auto-generated unit test stub with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
