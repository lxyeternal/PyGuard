  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'lakefs-client', used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools, and defining package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script mainly reads static files and defines package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content -> substitution of links via regex -> passing configuration to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls; the script performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines package metadata including name, version, requirements, and description. It reads the README.md to generate a long description with URL replacements using regex. The setup() function is called with all relevant parameters to prepare the package for distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious activities.",
