  "purpose": "Setup script for the lakeFS Python client package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script primarily reads a file and sets up package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns identified. The comments indicate deprecation status but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads a README file to generate a long description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script with added deprecation notices, which is typical in package maintenance. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with clear comments and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for packaging the library and managing dependencies, with no indication of malware or security issues.",
