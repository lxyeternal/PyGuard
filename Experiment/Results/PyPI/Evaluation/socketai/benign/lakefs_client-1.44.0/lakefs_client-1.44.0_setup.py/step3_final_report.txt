  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'lakefs-client', performing static configuration and documentation link adjustments.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file, performs regex substitution on its content.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads file content, applies static regex substitution, passes data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static file reading and string replacement. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The regex substitution is simple and safe, only modifying documentation links. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, safe analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate.",
