  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Overall Content & Purpose**:\n   - All reports describe the code as a generated, boilerplate unit test stub for the `ExternalPrincipalList` model in the lakeFS client SDK.\n   - They consistently note the absence of data processing, external communication, or any malicious activity.\n   - The code imports relevant modules and defines a test class with placeholder methods, with no actual test logic implemented.\n\n2. **Code Presence of Malicious Elements**:\n   - No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n   - No external data transmission or network activity is observed.\n   - The code is a standard scaffold generated by an API tool, meant for future implementation.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which aligns with the straightforward, well-understood purpose of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - Since the code is purely a test scaffold with no actual logic, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or adjustments?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (Code is clear, auto-generated scaffold)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (No security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code's purpose as a placeholder test scaffold, these scores are appropriate. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, standard auto-generated test boilerplate with no security concerns.",
