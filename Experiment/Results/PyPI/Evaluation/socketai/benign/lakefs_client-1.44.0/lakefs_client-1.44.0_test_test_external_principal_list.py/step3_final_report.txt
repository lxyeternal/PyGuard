  "purpose": "Auto-generated unit test scaffold for the ExternalPrincipalList model in the lakeFS Python SDK, intended for future implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for model classes, class and method definitions, commented placeholder for object construction.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a standard generated scaffold with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated unit test stub with no logic, data handling, or external communication. It imports relevant classes, defines a test class with placeholder methods, and contains no active code or data flows. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign, scaffold nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated test scaffold with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
