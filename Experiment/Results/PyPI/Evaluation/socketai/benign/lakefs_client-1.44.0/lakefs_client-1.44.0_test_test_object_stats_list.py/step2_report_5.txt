  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose:**\n   - The code is a boilerplate unit test stub for the `ObjectStatsList` model in the `lakefs_client` API SDK.\n   - It imports necessary modules, defines a test class with placeholder methods, and contains no actual test logic or data processing.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network calls, or data sinks.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, boilerplate, and auto-generated.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external communications, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - No obfuscation, malware, or malicious code segments are detected.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, auto-generated code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any security concerns, the risk score should be very low, close to 0.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - Some reports assign a securityRisk of 0.1, possibly due to the placeholder comment indicating incomplete test implementation. However, this does not imply a security risk but rather incomplete testing.\n   - The overall assessment should reflect that this is a standard, non-malicious scaffold with no security issues.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign, auto-generated test stub with no malicious or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores; they accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat and is typical of autogenerated test scaffolds.",
