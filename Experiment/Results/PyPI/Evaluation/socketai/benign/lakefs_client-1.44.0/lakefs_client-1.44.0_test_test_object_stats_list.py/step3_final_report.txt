{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a scaffold for unit testing the ObjectStatsList model within the lakefs_client SDK, providing a structure for future test implementation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, user inputs, or data reads; imports are static modules and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code does not process or transfer data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "The test method is a placeholder with only a comment and pass statement; no actual test logic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated unit test scaffold with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. It imports necessary modules, sets global references, and defines a test class with empty methods. No external inputs, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of active logic indicate a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with this benign, inert structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, autogenerated test scaffold with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
