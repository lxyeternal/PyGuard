{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal, auto-generated unit test scaffold for the CommitOverrides model in the lakefs_client library, intended for future test implementation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules sys, unittest, and lakefs_client.model.commit_overrides, but does not process any external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only placeholder methods.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not perform any data processing or communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies; it is a straightforward, incomplete test scaffold with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, auto-generated test stub with no operational logic, data handling, or external communication. It imports necessary modules and defines a test class with placeholder methods. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports correctly identify it as a benign, incomplete test scaffold. The current scores are justified and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
