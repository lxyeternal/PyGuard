  "purpose": "Auto-generated unit test scaffold for lakeFS API client model ActionRunList",
  "sources": "Imports of modules and model classes; class and method definitions; placeholder test method",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling; no data sinks or network operations",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; code only defines structure without execution or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual test logic; placeholder methods with 'pass'; no suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated test stub with no active logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports agree on its benign, boilerplate nature. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's harmless structure. The code's purpose is solely structural, awaiting further implementation, with no security concerns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, auto-generated test scaffold with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and should remain at zero. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
