{
  "purpose": "A multithreaded socket server with SSL support, handling client connections via a thread pool, performing handshakes, request processing, and housekeeping.",
  "sources": "Socket accept calls, SSL handshake routines, request handling via daemon.handleRequest, environment variables for SSL configuration.",
  "sinks": "Client socket communication, request processing, potential data leakage if insecure handling occurs, socket closure.",
  "flows": "Accept connection -> perform handshake -> handle request -> handle exceptions -> disconnect client -> cleanup resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard, secure socket server with thread pooling, SSL configuration via external variables, and proper exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's straightforward and secure design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure, multithreaded socket server with no malicious or suspicious features. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
