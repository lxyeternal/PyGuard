  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of a Pyro name server with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The supply chain security risk is very low, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
