  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, extensible serialization framework with no active malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its primary security risk stems from deserializing untrusted data, which could lead to arbitrary object creation or code execution if not properly validated. Proper validation, whitelisting, and cautious use are recommended to mitigate these risks."
