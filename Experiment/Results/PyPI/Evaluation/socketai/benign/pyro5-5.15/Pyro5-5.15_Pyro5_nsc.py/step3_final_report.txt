  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for managing a Pyro name server, allowing listing, lookup, registration, removal, and metadata management of server entries.",
  "sources": "User command-line arguments, input() prompts for confirmation, external method calls on 'namesrv' object.",
  "sinks": "Method calls on 'namesrv' (e.g., register, remove, list), print statements for output, input() for confirmation prompts.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line args or input() -> corresponding 'namesrv' method invocation -> output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of input() for confirmation prompts is standard; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for managing a Pyro name server. It relies on external modules 'core' and 'errors' assumed to be trustworthy. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. User input prompts are standard safety measures. No insecure practices or suspicious patterns are identified. The code's logic is clear, with proper command dispatching and error handling. External dependencies are invoked via trusted interfaces. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The use of input() for mass removal confirmation, while potentially exploitable if environment is compromised, is a common pattern and does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent management CLI for a Pyro name server. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The only notable behavior is the confirmation prompt before mass removal, which is standard and not inherently risky. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in its intended context.",
