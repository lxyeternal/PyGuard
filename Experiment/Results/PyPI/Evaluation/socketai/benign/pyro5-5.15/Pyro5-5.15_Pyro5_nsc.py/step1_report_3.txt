  "purpose": "A command-line utility for controlling and managing a Pyro name server, allowing listing, lookup, registration, removal, and metadata management of name server entries.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments, user prompts (input()), and environment/configuration in core.locate_ns.",
  "sinks": "Printing to stdout, user input prompts, and calling functions that modify the name server's data (register, remove, set_metadata).",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> handle_command functions -> core methods (e.g., register, remove, set_metadata) -> output to stdout or user prompts.",
  "anomalies": "The use of input() for confirmation before mass deletion; no hardcoded credentials or secrets present. No unusual or obfuscated code detected. No hidden network activity or file manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a command-line interface for managing a name server, with functions to list, lookup, register, remove, and modify metadata. It handles user input, command dispatching, and interacts with the core module for name server operations. No evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The only potential concern is the removal command's confirmation prompt, which is a user interaction safeguard, not malicious. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward management tool for the name server.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard management utility for a Pyro name server with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses user prompts for mass deletion confirmation and performs expected name server operations without insecure patterns.",
