  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent management CLI for a Pyro name server. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The only notable behavior is the confirmation prompt before mass removal, which is standard and not inherently risky. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in its intended context."
