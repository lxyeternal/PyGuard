  "purpose": "This code defines a Configuration class for managing Pyro (Python Remote Objects) settings, allowing defaults, environment variable overrides, copying, and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Environment variables with prefix PYRO_ that override default configuration attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data into system effects or leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and validated, then set as attributes; diagnostics print configuration details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard environment variable parsing and validation are used.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler with environment variable support, validation, and diagnostic functions. It does not perform network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. SSL parameters are initialized safely. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. Validation for booleans and collections reduces injection risks. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and typical for such purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration management module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
  "confidence": 1,
