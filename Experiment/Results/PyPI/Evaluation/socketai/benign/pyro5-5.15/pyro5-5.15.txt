The only notable behavior is the confirmation prompt before mass removal, which is standard and not inherently risky. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in its intended context."

It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The network operations are typical for such frameworks, with potential for abuse via broadcast but no malicious intent. The scores assigned are accurate and reflect the actual security posture."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical Pyro remote object server with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of 'marshal.loads()' in '__deserializeBlobArgs()', which can lead to remote code execution if malicious data is deserialized. Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The risk score should be around 0.45 to 0.5, reflecting the deserialization vulnerability. Improving safety would involve replacing 'marshal.loads()' with safer deserialization methods and adding authentication controls."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, extensible serialization framework with no active malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its primary security risk stems from deserializing untrusted data, which could lead to arbitrary object creation or code execution if not properly validated. Proper validation, whitelisting, and cautious use are recommended to mitigate these risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of context management for Pyro calls, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified due to reliance on external data, but overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
