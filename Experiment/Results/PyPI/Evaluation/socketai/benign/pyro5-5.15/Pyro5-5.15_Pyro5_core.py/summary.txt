  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of URI handling and network-based name resolution for a distributed object system. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The network operations are typical for such frameworks, with potential for abuse via broadcast but no malicious intent. The scores assigned are accurate and reflect the actual security posture."
