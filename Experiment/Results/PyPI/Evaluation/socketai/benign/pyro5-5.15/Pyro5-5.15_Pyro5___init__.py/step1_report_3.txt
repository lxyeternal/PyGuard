  "purpose": "The code initializes logging configuration for the Pyro package based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables 'PYRO_LOGLEVEL' and 'PYRO_LOGFILE' using os.environ.get.",
  "targets": "Configures the Python logging module and returns log filename and level.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> logging configuration -> logger setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code simply configures logging based on env vars.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally configures the logging system depending on environment variables, with no untrusted data execution or external network communication. It includes standard logging setup, and the use of environment variables is typical for configurable logging. No anomalies, malicious logic, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard logging setup code with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
