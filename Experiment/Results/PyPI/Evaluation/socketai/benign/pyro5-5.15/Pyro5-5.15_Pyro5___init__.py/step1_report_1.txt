  "purpose": "Initialize logging configuration for the Pyro package based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables PYRO_LOGLEVEL and PYRO_LOGFILE; import statements for os and logging.",
  "sinks": "Logging setup affects internal logging behavior; no external data sinks or network connections are used here.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> logging configuration -> logger setup and potential log file creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code conditionally configures logging based on env vars, which is standard. No obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks environment variables to configure logging, which is common practice. It sets up logging handlers only if specified, otherwise disables logging by setting a high log level. No code injection, data leakage, or network activity is present. The import of a local module (configure) is standard, assuming safe use. No anomalies or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign logging setup routine with no signs of malicious behavior. It simply configures logging based on environment variables, with no external data exfiltration or backdoors.",
