  "purpose": "Configure Python logging based on environment variables, enabling or disabling logging accordingly.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PYRO_LOGLEVEL' and 'PYRO_LOGFILE' used to determine logging level and file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; logging outputs to file or stderr as configured.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence logging configuration; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard logging setup with environment-based configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward setup of the logging module, conditioned on environment variables. It imports a local module 'configure' but does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The use of environment variables is typical for configuration. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code's logic is clear and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration routine with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of environment variables for configuration is common and safe. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
