  "purpose": "The code initializes logging configuration for the Pyro package based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables PYRO_LOGLEVEL and PYRO_LOGFILE",
  "sinks": "Logging configuration could potentially be manipulated via environment variables to influence logging behavior",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> __configure_logging() -> logging setup",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to determine logging levels and output files, then configures the Python logging module accordingly. It only sets up logging if specific environment variables are present, otherwise it disables logging by setting a high log level. The code imports a configuration module at the end, which is standard practice. There are no indications of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code’s purpose is solely to configure logging behavior based on environment variables, which is common in application setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup routine with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is normal for such functionality. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
