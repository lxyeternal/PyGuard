  "purpose": "Initialize logging configuration for the Pyro package based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables PYRO_LOGLEVEL and PYRO_LOGFILE.",
  "sinks": "Uses logging.basicConfig to set logging behavior; logs an info message if configured.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → logging configuration → potential logging output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret data; no unusual code patterns; the code disables logging when PYRO_LOGLEVEL is not set, which is normal behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging based on environment variables. It reads PYRO_LOGLEVEL and PYRO_LOGFILE to determine logging level and output file. If PYRO_LOGLEVEL is set, it configures the logging module accordingly and logs an informational message. If not set, it disables logging by setting the log level to a high number (9999). There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code performs typical configuration tasks with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. It does not interact with network, filesystem beyond logging, or handle sensitive data in an insecure manner.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup function with no malicious intent or security risks. It dynamically configures logging based on environment variables, which is common and safe.",
