  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for packaging a Python project, importing sys (unused) and calling setup() with no arguments.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, call to setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Unused sys import, then setup() invocation",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of sys, but no malicious or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal setup script typical in Python packaging. It imports sys without using it, which is harmless. The setup() call with no arguments is standard. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. No obfuscation or security issues are evident. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No changes are necessary.",
