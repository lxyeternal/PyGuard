  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, standard, and intended for package setup.\n- No external data, network calls, or user input processing are involved.\n- The only code present is importing `sys` and calling `setup()`.\n- `sys` is imported but unused in all cases, which is a minor code smell but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The `malware` score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious activity:**  \n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or execute code based on external input.  \n   - The `setup()` function is standard in Python packaging and does not inherently pose security risks.\n\n2. **Code anomalies:**  \n   - The import of `sys` is unnecessary but not harmful.  \n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Risk scores:**  \n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - The `malware` score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential improvements:**  \n   - The only minor point is the unused `sys` import; it could be removed, but this does not impact security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packaging.\n- No malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
