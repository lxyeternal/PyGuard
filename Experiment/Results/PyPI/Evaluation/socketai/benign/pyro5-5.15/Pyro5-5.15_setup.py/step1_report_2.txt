{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports modules and calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no points where untrusted data could cause data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply executes setup() with default configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys (which is unused) and calls setuptools.setup() with no arguments, which is common in setup.py files. No input reading, data processing, or network interactions are present. The code appears to be a simple packaging script without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
