{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements (`sys` and `setuptools`) and executes the `setup()` function.",
  "sinks": "The `setup()` function is called, which typically performs package installation or configuration tasks.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are present; the code executes a standard setup process without data flow from external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports `sys` and `setuptools`, then calls `setup()`. This is a standard pattern for Python package setup files (e.g., setup.py). There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. No external data is processed, and no dangerous functions or code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a minimal, legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malware or security risks, and the likelihood of malicious behavior is extremely low.",
