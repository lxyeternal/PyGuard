  "purpose": "Manage thread-local call context data for Pyro remote calls, including resource tracking and call metadata.",
  "sources": "External input via 'from_global' method, and the 'client' object set externally.",
  "sinks": "Assignment in 'from_global' from external data; resource tracking methods interact with 'client' object.",
  "flows": "External data flows into the context via 'from_global'; resource tracking interacts with 'client' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The 'from_global' method assigns data from external sources, which could be a vector if untrusted, but no unsafe operations are performed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements thread-local storage for call context in a multi-threaded environment, with resource tracking via 'client'. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The 'from_global' method assigns data from external dictionaries, which could be risky if the source is untrusted, but within this code, it performs straightforward assignments. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. The resource tracking methods raise errors if misused, indicating proper error handling. Overall, the code is standard, clean, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of context management for Pyro calls, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified due to reliance on external data, but overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
