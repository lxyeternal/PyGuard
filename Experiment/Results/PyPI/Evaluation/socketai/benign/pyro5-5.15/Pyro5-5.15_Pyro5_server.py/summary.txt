  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Pyro remote object server with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of 'marshal.loads()' in '__deserializeBlobArgs()', which can lead to remote code execution if malicious data is deserialized. Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The risk score should be around 0.45 to 0.5, reflecting the deserialization vulnerability. Improving safety would involve replacing 'marshal.loads()' with safer deserialization methods and adding authentication controls."
