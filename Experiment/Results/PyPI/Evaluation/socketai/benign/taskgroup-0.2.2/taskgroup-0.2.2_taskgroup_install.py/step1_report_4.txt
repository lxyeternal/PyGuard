{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asyncio-based context manager to temporarily install a custom cancellation behavior, wrapping existing asyncio tasks with additional control and context management features.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.version_info, asyncio.current_task(), asyncio.get_running_loop(), and task.get_coro(). These are data sources for runtime environment info and task control.",
  "sinks": "Calls to task.cancel(), new_task.add_done_callback(), and asyncio-related coroutine operations are potential sinks where untrusted data could influence task control or behavior.",
  "flows": "The code flows from obtaining current tasks and their coroutines, creating a new task with custom callback behavior, installing a wrapper around the coroutine, and managing task cancellation and cleanup via yield points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard asyncio constructs, with no suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The use of contextvars and custom task management appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured asyncio utility that manages task wrapping and cancellation, with clear, documented behavior. It employs standard Python asyncio patterns, with no unusual or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present. It maintains control over task lifecycle and context. The only notable aspect is its focus on custom cancellation handling and wrapping, which aligns with typical asynchronous programming patterns rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and implements an asyncio context manager to handle task cancellation and wrapping safely. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The code is well-structured and employs common asyncio patterns, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
