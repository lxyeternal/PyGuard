  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a custom asyncio event loop runner with proper task and signal management. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code adheres to standard asyncio practices, with no suspicious patterns or malicious API misuse.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is legitimate and safe, which aligns with the code's structure and purpose.  \n- They note the import of `task_factory` from a local module (`.tasks`) but do not consider it suspicious, which is appropriate unless the module is malicious—nothing in the provided code suggests so.  \n- The reports mention the use of version-specific shutdown procedures, which is correct and shows attention to detail.\n\n**3. Score Justifications:**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, which seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the code manages signals and tasks—potentially misused if an attacker injects malicious coroutines. However, the code itself is safe.\n\n**4. Risk Score Analysis:**  \n- The overall risk scores are low (around 0.2 to 0.3). Given the code's purpose and structure, these are reasonable.  \n- The only potential concern is the import of `task_factory` from a local module, which could be malicious if the module is compromised. However, without further evidence, this remains a hypothetical risk.  \n- The code's handling of signals and task cancellation is standard and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is standard and does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- The reports acknowledge the use of custom task factory but do not consider it suspicious without further context.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No overestimation of malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is kept low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slightly conservative, considering potential misuse of the task factory, but overall low.\n\n**Additional Comments:**  \n- The code is a standard asyncio runner with proper handling, no signs of sabotage.  \n- The only minor concern is the source of `task_factory`, but this is not malicious in itself.  \n- The code is safe for use in controlled environments.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scores. The code appears safe, legitimate, and well-structured, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Maintain a low security risk score (~0.2), acknowledging the potential for misuse if the `task_factory` module is compromised, but no evidence suggests this is the case here.",
