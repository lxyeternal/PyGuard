{
  "purpose": "A custom asyncio event loop runner that manages the lifecycle of the event loop, handles signals, and ensures proper cleanup of asynchronous generators and executors.",
  "sources": "Input coroutine passed to run(), signal handlers for SIGINT, and internal task factory during run() execution.",
  "sinks": "Task execution via _task_factory, signal handling for SIGINT, and cleanup routines during close().",
  "flows": "Coroutine passed to run() -> task created via _task_factory -> signal handler may cancel main task -> cleanup routines during close().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; standard asyncio practices. The import of 'task_factory' from a local module is noted but not suspicious without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured asyncio utility that manages event loop creation, execution, and cleanup with proper signal handling. It avoids obfuscation and malicious patterns, following best practices for asyncio management. No external communications, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The signal handling and task cancellation are implemented correctly, and the use of version-specific shutdown procedures indicates attention to detail. The import of 'task_factory' from a local module is typical for extensibility and does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign and intended for safe use in asyncio-based applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard asyncio event loop runner with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to signal handling, which is standard practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.15–0.2, reflecting inherent risks in signal management but no malicious intent.",
