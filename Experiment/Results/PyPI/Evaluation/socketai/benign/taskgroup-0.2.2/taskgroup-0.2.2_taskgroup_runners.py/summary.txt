  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard asyncio event loop runner with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to signal handling, which is standard practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.15–0.2, reflecting inherent risks in signal management but no malicious intent."
