{
  "purpose": "Provides an asyncio-based timeout context manager that schedules task cancellation at a specified time, converting cancellations into TimeoutError if needed.",
  "sources": "Reads the current asyncio task, the event loop, and scheduling via loop.call_at or call_soon.",
  "sinks": "Cancels the current asyncio task upon timeout via task.cancel().",
  "flows": "Source: current_task(), loop.time(), when/delay inputs -> sink: task.cancel() during timeout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external data leaks, no backdoors. Uses standard asyncio APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard asyncio timeout utility, managing internal states and task cancellation. It uses asyncio's event loop to schedule cancellation at a specified time or delay. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of private modules (_install) appears to support proper setup, not malicious activity. The cancellation mechanism is typical for timeout implementations. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with standard asyncio practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate asyncio timeout utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to task cancellation, which is expected in such utilities. The current scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2.",
