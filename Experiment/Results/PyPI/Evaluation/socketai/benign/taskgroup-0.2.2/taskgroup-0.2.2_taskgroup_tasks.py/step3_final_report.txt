{
  "purpose": "The code provides a context-aware extension of asyncio's Task system, wrapping coroutines with an _Interceptor to run within a specified context, primarily for context propagation or debugging.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from coroutine objects, context variables, and version-dependent type aliases; it does not read external untrusted input or files.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with coroutine methods (send, throw, close) and context variables; no data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Coroutines are wrapped with _Interceptor which runs their methods within a specific context; this wrapping is transparent to the rest of the code, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of private attribute access (_Interceptor__coro) is noted but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code extends asyncio's Task to include context propagation via _Interceptor, which wraps coroutine objects to run their methods within a provided context. It manages cancellation counts and provides compatibility across Python versions. The wrapping is standard for context management and debugging, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common patterns for asyncio extensions. No suspicious data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate utility for context-aware asyncio task management. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
