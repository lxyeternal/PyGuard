{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom asyncio Task and coroutine handling classes, including an interceptor to manage context variables during coroutine execution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for Task class (coroutine, context, loop), environment variables, and runtime sys.version_info for version-specific code branches.",
  "sinks": "Methods that invoke coroutine methods (send, throw) within a specific context, and Task creation functions that execute coroutines.",
  "flows": "Input coroutine → wrapped by _Interceptor if context provided → passed to Task constructor → executed with custom context management. No untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of contextvars and custom interceptor are normal for context management. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual control flows observed. No obfuscation or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages asynchronous task execution with context variable support. It dynamically adapts to Python versions for type aliases and class definitions. The _Interceptor class wraps coroutine objects to execute their methods within a specified context, ensuring context propagation. The Task class extends asyncio.Task, adding cancellation tracking and exposing coroutine retrieval. The task_factory creates Task instances. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code appears to serve as a utility for context-aware asynchronous task management, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of context-managed asyncio task wrappers with version compatibility. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
