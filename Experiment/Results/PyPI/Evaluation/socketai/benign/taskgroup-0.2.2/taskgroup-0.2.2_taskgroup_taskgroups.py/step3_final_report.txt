  "purpose": "Implementation of an asyncio TaskGroup for managing groups of asynchronous tasks with exception handling and cancellation support.",
  "sources": "System info via sys.version_info, asyncio modules, exceptiongroup library, internal modules (_install, _tasks).",
  "sinks": "Internal task creation and exception handling; no external data or network sinks.",
  "flows": "Task creation from coroutines, exception propagation, cancellation signals, and exception aggregation via BaseExceptionGroup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured asyncio TaskGroup implementation, managing task lifecycle, exceptions, and cancellations properly. It uses exceptiongroup appropriately for exception aggregation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate asyncio TaskGroup utility with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The low risk score reflects the complexity of task management but does not indicate vulnerabilities.",
