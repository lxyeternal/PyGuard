{
  "purpose": "Provide backported implementations of asyncio.TaskGroup, asyncio.Runner, and asyncio.timeout for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.runners, .taskgroups, .timeouts). No direct input reading or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code primarily imports and exposes functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious variables, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and primarily modular.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a package version and exposes certain functionalities by importing them from local modules. There is no data processing, network communication, or evaluation of untrusted input. The structure aligns with typical library entry points. The code appears benign and intended for providing compatibility shims for asyncio features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup that re-exports functions and classes for backporting asyncio features. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet.",
