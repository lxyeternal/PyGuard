{
  "purpose": "Provide a backport of asyncio.TaskGroup, asyncio.Runner, and asyncio.timeout for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports from .runners, .taskgroups, and .timeouts",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import statements from internal modules; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that sets version info, defines an export list, and imports specific classes/functions from internal modules. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or external input handling. The structure is typical for a package initializer. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The code's purpose is to provide asyncio backports, and it appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer for a Python package providing asyncio backports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
