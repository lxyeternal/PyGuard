{
  "purpose": "Provide a backport of asyncio features such as TaskGroup, Runner, and timeout functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .runners, .taskgroups, .timeouts",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; code only imports and exposes functions/classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__) and __all__ for exports, then imports specific classes and functions from local modules. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no outputs or external interactions. The code appears to serve as a simple interface layer to aggregate and expose functionalities related to asyncio backports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports specific asyncio backport functionalities. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure and content indicate it is a benign package component.",
