{
  "purpose": "Provides backported implementations of asyncio.TaskGroup, asyncio.Runner, and asyncio.timeout for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .runners, .taskgroups, .timeouts.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules are used to expose functions and classes; no external data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and exports specific classes and functions imported from internal modules. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. It appears to be a standard module initialization file with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module bootstrap for backporting asyncio features. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
