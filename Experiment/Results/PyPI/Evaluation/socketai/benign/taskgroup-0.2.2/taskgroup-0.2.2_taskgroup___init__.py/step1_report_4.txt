  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that provides backported versions of asyncio features such as TaskGroup, Runner, and timeout functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .runners, .taskgroups, .timeouts",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; code mainly imports and defines module exports",
  "flows": "Imported functions and classes are exposed via __all__, with no data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious variables, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer. It imports specific classes and functions from local submodules and exposes them through the __all__ list. The initial comments clarify that it provides backported asyncio features. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior appears present. The code structure is standard and focused solely on module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple module initialization file with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It merely consolidates imports and exports for asyncio backport features.",
