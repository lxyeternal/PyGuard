  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- *Issue presence:* No code provided, so no issues can be confirmed.  \n- *Errors/flaws:* None, as it correctly states the lack of code.  \n- *Scores:* All zeroes are appropriate.  \n- *Comments:* No action needed.  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- *Issue presence:* No code supplied, so no concrete issues can be identified.  \n- *Errors/flaws:* The report assumes the code is benign based on typical patterns, but without code, this is speculative. It should emphasize the lack of actual code rather than infer benignity.  \n- *Scores:* Confidence is 0.4, securityRisk is 0.2, malware is 0.0 — these seem reasonable given the limited info.  \n- *Justification:* The low malware and risk scores are justified, but the report's language could be more cautious about assumptions.  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- *Issue presence:* No code provided.  \n- *Errors/flaws:* Correctly states that no analysis can be performed.  \n- *Scores:* Confidence is high (1), malware and risk are zero — appropriate.  \n- *Comments:* No issues here.  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- *Issue presence:* No code provided.  \n- *Errors/flaws:* Similar to others, it states the absence of code limits analysis, which is correct.  \n- *Scores:* Slightly higher confidence (0.7), but still appropriate.  \n- *Comments:* No issues.  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- *Issue presence:* No code supplied.  \n- *Errors/flaws:* Correctly notes the lack of code prevents any assessment.  \n- *Scores:* All zeros are suitable.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Issue confirmation:** None of the reports detect actual issues, as no code was provided.  \n- **Logical flaws:** The reports are consistent in noting the absence of code. Some overreach occurs when they infer benign behavior; they should explicitly state that without code, no conclusions can be drawn about maliciousness.  \n- **Score consistency:** All scores are reasonable given the context.  \n- **Malware & risk scores:** Since no code is provided, the malware and risk scores should remain very low or zero.  \n- **Potential for false positives:** The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior without evidence, which is correct.  \n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no code, so no obfuscation can be detected)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no code, no risk)  \n\n**Overall, the reports are cautious and appropriate given the lack of code.**  \nIf I were to assign my own estimates based on the pattern of missing code, I would keep all scores at zero, emphasizing that no malicious or obfuscated activity can be inferred without actual code content.",
