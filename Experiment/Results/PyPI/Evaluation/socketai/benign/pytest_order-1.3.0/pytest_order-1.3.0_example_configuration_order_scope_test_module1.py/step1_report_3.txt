  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of pytest markers to specify test execution order.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the test framework via pytest.mark.order annotations",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Test functions are ordered based on marker values, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Usage of standard pytest markers and simple test functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two test functions with specific order annotations. The purpose is to control test execution order, as documented in the referenced pytest-order plugin. There are no inputs, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present. The code appears straightforward and intended for testing workflow management. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating test ordering in pytest. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
