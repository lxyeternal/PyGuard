  "purpose": "Test file demonstrating the use of pytest-order plugin for ordering test execution.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest and uses pytest.mark.order to set test execution order.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or security-impacting operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines test functions with ordering metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to typical test definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and applies order marks to two test functions. It serves as a configuration example for test ordering. No input/output, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign test configuration example with no malicious intent or security risks.",
