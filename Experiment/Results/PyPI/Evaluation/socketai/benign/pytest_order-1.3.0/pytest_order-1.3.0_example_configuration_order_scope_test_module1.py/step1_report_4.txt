{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of pytest markers to specify test execution order based on the --order-scope option.",
  "sources": "Imports the pytest library; reads test functions annotated with markers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; test annotations influence execution order but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard usage of pytest features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two test functions with order markers. It is a simple, standard test setup referencing pytest-order plugin documentation. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The annotations are for test execution order control. No suspicious activity, external network operations, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test setup utilizing pytest markers to control test order. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign and intended for organizing test execution sequence.",
