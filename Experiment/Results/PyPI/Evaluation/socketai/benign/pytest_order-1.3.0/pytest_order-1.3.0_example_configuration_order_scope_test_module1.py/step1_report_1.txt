  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of pytest markers to specify the order of test execution.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; only static code annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines test functions with markers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard pytest features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and uses decorators to assign order markers to test functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious operations. The markers are for test execution order control, with no external communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify test order in pytest. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
