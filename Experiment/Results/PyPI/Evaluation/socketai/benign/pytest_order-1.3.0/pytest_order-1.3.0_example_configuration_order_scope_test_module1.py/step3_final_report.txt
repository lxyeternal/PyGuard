{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of pytest's --order-scope option for controlling test execution order.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from no external sources; it defines static test functions with decorators.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets test order markers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, defines two test functions with order decorators, and contains no external interactions or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The confidence scores are high, justified by the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is solely to demonstrate test ordering, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest test file demonstrating test order configuration. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the absence of malicious or security issues. No modifications are necessary.",
