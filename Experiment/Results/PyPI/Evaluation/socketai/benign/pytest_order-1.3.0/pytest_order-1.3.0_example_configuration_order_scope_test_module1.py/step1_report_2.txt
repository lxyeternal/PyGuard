{
  "purpose": "The code is a test file demonstrating the use of the pytest-order plugin to specify test execution order.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines test functions with order markers.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual behavior; it is a straightforward test configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and uses the pytest.mark.order decorator to specify the order of test execution. The functions test1 and test2 are simple placeholders with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no hardcoded secrets, input/output operations, or malicious constructs. The use of the order marker aligns with normal testing practices to control test sequence. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test setup demonstrating test ordering with pytest. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns.",
