{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script demonstrating the usage of the '--sparse-ordering' option in pytest for ordering test execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains hardcoded test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines test functions with annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple pytest test module with functions decorated to specify order. It uses standard pytest features without external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The annotations and assertions are straightforward, serving only to demonstrate test ordering. No malicious or suspicious code constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard pytest test script illustrating test ordering. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
