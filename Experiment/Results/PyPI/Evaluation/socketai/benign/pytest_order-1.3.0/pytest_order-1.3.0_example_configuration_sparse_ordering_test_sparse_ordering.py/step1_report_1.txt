{
  "purpose": "This code is a test script demonstrating the use of the --sparse-ordering option in pytest, with test functions ordered explicitly via decorators.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the test functions themselves, which are invoked by pytest during test execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only asserts True in each test case, with no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the tests are simple assertions with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, defines four test functions, and uses pytest markers to specify execution order. All functions assert True, serving as placeholders or simple tests. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. There is no evidence of malware, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a legitimate test script demonstrating pytest ordering features.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard pytest test file demonstrating ordering with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.",
