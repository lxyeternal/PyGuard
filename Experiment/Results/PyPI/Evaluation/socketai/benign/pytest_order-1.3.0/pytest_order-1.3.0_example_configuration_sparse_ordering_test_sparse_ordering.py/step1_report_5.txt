{
  "purpose": "The code is a test script for the pytest framework, demonstrating the use of the --sparse-ordering option to control test execution order.",
  "sources": "The code reads test function definitions and associated metadata (pytest marks).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The test functions are executed in an order influenced by the specified marks, but no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. Usage of pytest markers is standard and explicitly documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest module and defines four test functions with optional order markers. The markers influence execution order but do not introduce security issues. The code does not contain any malicious logic, external data handling, or obfuscated components. It is straightforward test code adhering to pytest conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test script demonstrating pytest's ordering feature. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
