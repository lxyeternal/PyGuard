{
  "purpose": "A minimal pytest test module demonstrating the --sparse-ordering feature with test functions ordered via decorators.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the test functions themselves; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes simple assertions without data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard pytest constructs and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple pytest test suite with four functions, some decorated with @pytest.mark.order() to specify execution order. All functions assert True, serving as placeholders. There are no external inputs, data leaks, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns. The code is standard for demonstrating pytest features. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or external communication. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward pytest demonstration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
