{
  "purpose": "This code is a test script demonstrating the use of the --sparse-ordering option in pytest.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code only defines test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines test assertions with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines four test functions with specified order markers. All functions perform simple assertions. There is no input handling, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The usage of pytest markers is standard and non-malicious. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of pytest ordering features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test script illustrating pytest's ordering capabilities. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
