  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` for a Python package named `pytest-order`.\n- It reads static files (`README.md`), imports version info from the package (`pytest_order.__version__`), and defines dependencies with conditional logic based on Python version.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code detected.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward and typical for package setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, safe, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as Report 1, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same, but notes `securityRisk=0.1`.\n- **Analysis:** This is inconsistent with the actual code, which shows no suspicious activity.\n- **Justification:** The `securityRisk` score should be 0, as there's no indication of risk.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce `securityRisk` from 0.1 to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** For the reports, a value of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate, since no security risks are evident.\n\n**Particularly for Report 4:**\n- The assigned `securityRisk=0.1` seems unjustified given the code's nature.\n- **Recommended adjustment:** Set `securityRisk=0`.\n\n---\n\n### **Final verdict:**\n\n- The code is a typical, safe `setup.py` script.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores in the reports are generally accurate, with the exception of Report 4's slightly elevated security risk score.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence, confirming the code's safety and lack of malicious intent.",
