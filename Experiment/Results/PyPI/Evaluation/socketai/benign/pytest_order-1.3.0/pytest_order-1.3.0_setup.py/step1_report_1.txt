{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'pytest-order' with metadata and dependencies for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory path (__here__), reads the README.md file for long description, imports version info from pytest_order, and specifies install requirements based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present; the script mainly handles static metadata and configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input; only static data and package setup logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads static files, and defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical setup script format. It conditionally specifies dependencies based on Python version, which is standard. No malicious code, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated behavior detected. All operations are consistent with a standard package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package named 'pytest-order'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
