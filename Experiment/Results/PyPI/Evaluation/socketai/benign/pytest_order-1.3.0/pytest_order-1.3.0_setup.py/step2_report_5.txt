  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The code reads static files, imports version info, and configures package metadata and dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code's standard nature. No dynamic code execution or external data manipulation is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with previous findings. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports. The only notable point is a securityRisk score of 0.1, which seems to be an overestimation given the absence of any real security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — this seems too high for a standard setup script.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be 0, as there's no indication of actual risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; standard setup code with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0, except Report 4's 0.1, which is unjustified.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The **securityRisk** score for Report 4 should be **0**, as no actual security risk is present.\n- All other scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The only correction needed is lowering the securityRisk score in Report 4 to 0.",
