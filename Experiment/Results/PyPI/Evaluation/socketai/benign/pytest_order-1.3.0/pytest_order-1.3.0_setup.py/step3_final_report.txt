  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the pytest-order Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads static files (README.md), imports version info from pytest_order.__version__, and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used only for package configuration.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from files and imports into setup configuration; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs typical setup tasks without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads static files, imports version info, and specifies dependencies with conditional requirements based on Python version. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or obfuscated code. The code's structure and content are standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard packaging configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports correctly identify this, except for report 4, which assigns a slightly elevated security risk score of 0.1; this should be corrected to 0 to reflect the benign nature of the code.",
