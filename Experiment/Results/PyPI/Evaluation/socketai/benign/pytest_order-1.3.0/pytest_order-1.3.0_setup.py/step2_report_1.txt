  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script for packaging.\n- Sources: Reads static files and version info.\n- Flows & anomalies: No untrusted data, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: All operations are typical; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard packaging code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources & flows: Static data, no external or untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose & sources: Static data, version info, README.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard package setup.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose & sources: Static data, version info, README.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Note:** The report assigns a `securityRisk=0.1`, which is inconsistent with the rest. Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, this should be 0.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — more consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose & sources: Standard setup.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The only inconsistency is in report 4, which assigns a `securityRisk=0.1` despite no evidence supporting it. This should be corrected to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all, given the lack of any security concerns.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, except for report 4's slight inconsistency in the security risk score, which should be corrected to 0.",
