  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the script as a standard setup.py for the 'pytest-order' package.\n- The code reads static files, imports version info, and configures package metadata and dependencies.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted data sources are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The only point of note is in report 4, which assigns a securityRisk score of 0.1, but this is still very low.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \nYes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary?**  \nNo. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious intent.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- Malware: all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: all assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk: all are at 0 or very close (0.1 in report 4). Given the code's nature, this is reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nNone of the reports assign such scores, and based on the code, none are justified. The code is a typical setup script.\n\n**5. Malware score justification:**  \nZero across all reports, which aligns with the code analysis. No malicious behavior is present.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**  \nNo such claims are made; all assessments are based on code analysis.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**  \nScores are consistent with the findings. No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code performs standard package setup tasks.  \n- No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data.  \n- No obfuscation or hidden behavior.  \n- The only minor point is the low security risk score in report 4, which is justifiable as a conservative estimate, but still negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence to suggest any higher risk.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep the scores at 0 for malware and obfuscated, and 0 for security risk, as the code is safe.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Work through completed.**",
