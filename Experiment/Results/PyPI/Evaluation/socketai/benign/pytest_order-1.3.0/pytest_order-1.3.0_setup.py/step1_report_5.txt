{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the pytest-order plugin package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading __version__ from pytest_order, reading README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or user input that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "Reading __version__ to include in setup, reading README.md content to include as long_description, then passing all data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. Usage of standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads version info from pytest_order, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted data sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behaviors. All dependencies and configurations are standard for Python package setup. The code appears straightforward and aligns with typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It securely manages package metadata and dependencies without suspicious or malicious patterns.",
