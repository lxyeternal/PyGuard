  "purpose": "Setup script for the pytest-order package, configuring its metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ from pytest_order, reads README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Version info from pytest_order → setup configuration; README content → long_description",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports package version info from pytest_order, reads README.md for documentation, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It uses conditional dependencies based on Python version. No untrusted data sources, external code execution, or obfuscated code present. The code adheres to standard setup practices without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly handles package configuration and dependencies.",
