  "purpose": "Setup script for the pytest-order package, configuring metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading __version__ from pytest_order, reading README.md file",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is being written or sent over the network",
  "flows": "Reading version info and long description; no untrusted data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and os, reads the package version from pytest_order, reads README content, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution, no dynamic code, no external data manipulation, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. All dependencies and data reads are standard for package setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code strictly performs package configuration tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
