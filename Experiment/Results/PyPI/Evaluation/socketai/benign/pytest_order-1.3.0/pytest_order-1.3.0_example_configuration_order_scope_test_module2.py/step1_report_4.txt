{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the usage of pytest's order marking to control test execution order.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test functions and their associated metadata for ordering.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets test execution order.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors; the code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and defines two test functions with specified execution order using the pytest.mark.order decorator. The code appears to be a simple test file illustrating pytest ordering features. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code is standard, and its purpose is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as an example for pytest test ordering. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors detected.",
