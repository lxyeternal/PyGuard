  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the usage of pytest markers to specify test execution order based on the '--order-scope' option.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines test functions with ordering metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior are present. Usage of pytest markers is standard for ordering tests.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest, defines two test functions with order markers (test2 with order 2, test1 with order 1). The code references pytest-order plugin documentation but does not perform any dynamic or unsafe operations. No external inputs, network activities, or data manipulations are present. The code serves a configuration purpose within testing frameworks and contains no malicious or security-sensitive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless test setup demonstrating ordered test execution. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
