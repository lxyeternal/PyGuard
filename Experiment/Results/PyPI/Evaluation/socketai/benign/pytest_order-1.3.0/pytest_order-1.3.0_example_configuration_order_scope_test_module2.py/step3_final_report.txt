  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of pytest-order plugin to specify test execution order.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; code defines two test functions with order decorators.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static code with no external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, minimal test code with no obfuscation or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static demonstration of pytest's ordering feature, with two empty test functions decorated with order markers. No external data, network activity, or sensitive information handling is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as an illustrative example. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The current scores and assessments are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
