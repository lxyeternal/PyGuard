{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test file demonstrating the usage of the pytest-order plugin to specify test execution order.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are used; the code imports pytest and uses decorators for test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data outputs in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves applying order markers to test functions, which do not process external data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and clearly for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two test functions, test1 and test2, each marked with an order marker to specify execution sequence. The comments reference documentation for pytest-order, indicating educational or demonstrative intent. No input/output, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations are present. The simplicity and transparency suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test example demonstrating pytest-order configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.",
