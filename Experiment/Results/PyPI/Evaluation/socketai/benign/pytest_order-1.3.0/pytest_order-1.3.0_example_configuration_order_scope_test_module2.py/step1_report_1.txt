  "purpose": "The code is a test file demonstrating the use of the pytest-order plugin to specify the order of test execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only uses test decorators and functions defined within the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; test functions are placeholders with no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and applies order markers to two test functions, which are empty. It serves as an example or demonstration of the pytest-order plugin's features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward and uses standard testing conventions without any obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign test file intended to demonstrate the use of test ordering in pytest. No malicious or security risks are present.",
