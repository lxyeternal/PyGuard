{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of pytest markers to specify test execution order based on the 'order' marker.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it relies solely on static test function definitions and markers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only defines test order markers without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, using pytest features as intended without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, applies order markers to test functions, and does not include any dynamic or unsafe code. It does not handle or process external data, and the markers are for test execution order control only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign test configuration snippet demonstrating pytest's ordering capabilities. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
