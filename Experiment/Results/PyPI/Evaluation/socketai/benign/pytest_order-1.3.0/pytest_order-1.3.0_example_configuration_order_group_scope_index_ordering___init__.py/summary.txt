  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the mention of dynamic execution in Report 3, which should be reflected in a slightly higher malware score. Adjusting Report 3's malware score to 0.3 enhances accuracy, while other scores remain appropriate. Overall, the code is considered low risk, but vigilance regarding dynamic features is advised."
