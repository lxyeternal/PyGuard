  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific computational or utility task, but no explicit description is provided within the code snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and potentially from imported modules or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to standard output, logs, or external network connections if present. Potentially dangerous sinks include network calls or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly involving dynamic execution or network communication, to sinks such as output or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. The code does not display obfuscated language features or misleading variable names. If there are dynamic imports or eval statements, these could be suspicious, but none are evident without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert network activity. All third-party library usage appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or dangerous patterns are visible. The structure suggests typical input-processing-output flow, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose without evident backdoors or malicious payloads.",
