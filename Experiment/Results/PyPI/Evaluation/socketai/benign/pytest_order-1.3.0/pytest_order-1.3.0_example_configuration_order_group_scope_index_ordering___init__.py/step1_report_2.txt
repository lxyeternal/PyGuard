  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for standard functionality with no explicit malicious intent identified.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and user input via standard input functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to standard output and logs; no sensitive data is directed to external networks or files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and user input flow into processing functions, which then output to stdout or logs without external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code uses standard library functions and typical control structures.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes by importing standard modules and reading environment variables and user inputs. It performs basic data processing, with no evidence of code injection, obfuscated code, or dangerous operations. No network connections or file modifications indicative of malicious activity are present. The overall structure is typical for a CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and aligned with typical application logic.",
