  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to import necessary modules and execute some functionality that is not explicitly shown in the snippet. It likely pertains to a Python package intended for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from the import statements and possibly from environment variables or input functions if present in unseen parts. No explicit data sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are functions or methods that could process untrusted data, such as network calls, file operations, or execution functions. However, none are evident in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are observable in the provided fragment. The code shows import statements but no data processing or flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual language features in the provided snippet. The code appears standard and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no further logic shown. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present in this fragment. Given the limited context, no malicious intent or security issues are detectable. However, the analysis is constrained by the lack of additional code that may contain further operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears standard and benign, though a full review of the entire package would be necessary to be certain.",
