{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of pytest for organizing test execution order, specifically utilizing the --order-group-scope option.",
  "sources": "The code reads test function definitions and the pytest.mark.order decorator annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present; no data leaks or effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input (test definitions) -> pytest decorators (order marking) -> test execution order, but no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs; the code is straightforward test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, uses a decorator to specify the execution order of a test function, and defines simple test functions. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations. The code is consistent with standard testing practices and contains no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign example of pytest test organization with no malicious or security-related issues. It primarily demonstrates test ordering configuration and contains no suspicious behavior.",
