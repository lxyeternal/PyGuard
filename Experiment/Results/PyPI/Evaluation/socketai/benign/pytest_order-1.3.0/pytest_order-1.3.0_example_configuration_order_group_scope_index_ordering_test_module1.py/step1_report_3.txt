{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of pytest framework to run test functions with specific order annotations, primarily for test organization and execution control.",
  "sources": "The code reads test definitions and their order annotations; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or data processing are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward test definitions with a documentation comment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two simple test functions. One function is decorated with a pytest marker indicating order, and the other is plain. The code includes only a docstring referencing documentation about pytest ordering options. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of pytest test functions with ordering annotations, intended for test execution order control. There is no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies.",
