{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of pytest with order markers for test execution sequencing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports pytest and uses test functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no data leaks, no output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from source to sink as the code does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward test definition with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, defines two test functions, one of which uses an order marker. It appears to serve as an example or test setup for pytest ordering. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not perform any system modifications, network communication, or data manipulation beyond test annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign test file illustrating pytest ordering features. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
