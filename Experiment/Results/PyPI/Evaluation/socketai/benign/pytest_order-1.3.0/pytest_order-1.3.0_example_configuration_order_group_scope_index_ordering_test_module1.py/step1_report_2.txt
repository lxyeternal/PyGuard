{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of pytest markers for test ordering, likely for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module and imports pytest.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining test functions and applying a marker to one of them; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing pytest and defining two test functions, with one marked to run second. It includes a comment referencing pytest-order documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test file demonstrating pytest features. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
