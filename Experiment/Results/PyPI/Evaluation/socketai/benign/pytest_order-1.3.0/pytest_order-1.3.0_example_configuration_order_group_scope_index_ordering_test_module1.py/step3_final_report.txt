{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of pytest's --order-group-scope option with test functions, illustrating test ordering without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Import of pytest module, definition of test functions, use of pytest.mark.order decorator",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or network operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static test functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple pytest test file demonstrating test ordering. It contains no malicious code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's purpose is educational, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and demonstrates pytest ordering features without security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
