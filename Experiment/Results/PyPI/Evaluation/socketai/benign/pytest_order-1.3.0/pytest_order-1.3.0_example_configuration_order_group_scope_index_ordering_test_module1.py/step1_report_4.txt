  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of the --order-group-scope option in pytest for test execution ordering.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; only test function definitions and annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leaks; no code executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test file using pytest, with one test marked to run second in order. It contains only test function definitions and a comment explaining an option. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. No external data handling, no network operations, no credential usage, and no suspicious code flow.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign test file intended for demonstration purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks present.",
