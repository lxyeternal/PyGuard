  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of pytest's --order-group-scope option for controlling test execution order.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, environment variables, or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No data is written, transmitted, or processed; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple pytest test functions with an ordering marker. It contains no malicious code, external interactions, or obfuscation. The comments and documentation links clarify its purpose as a demonstration. The functions are placeholders with no logic, and no data flows or external dependencies are present. The use of pytest markers for ordering is standard and safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of pytest's ordering features with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. No modifications are necessary.",
