  "purpose": "The code is a test file demonstrating the use of pytest's order marking for test execution order control.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code imports pytest and defines test functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; test order marking is for test execution sequence control only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two simple test functions. The second test is marked to run before the first using pytest's ordering mechanism. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward test configuration example.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test configuration sample demonstrating test ordering using pytest markers. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
