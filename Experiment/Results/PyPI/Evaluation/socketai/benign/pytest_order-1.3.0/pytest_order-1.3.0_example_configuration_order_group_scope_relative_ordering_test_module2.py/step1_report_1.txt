{
  "purpose": "The code is a test file demonstrating the use of pytest-order plugin features for controlling test execution order.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data, environment variables, or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, defines two simple test functions, and uses a pytest marker to specify test order. The functions do nothing, serving as placeholders or demonstration. There are no external data sources, no potentially malicious code, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The use of pytest-order is legitimate and documented. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test script demonstrating a pytest feature. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and has no anomalous or malicious behaviors.",
