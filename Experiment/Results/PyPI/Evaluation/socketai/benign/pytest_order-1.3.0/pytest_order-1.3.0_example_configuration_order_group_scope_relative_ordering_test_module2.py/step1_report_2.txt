{
  "purpose": "This code is a test file demonstrating the use of pytest with ordering options for test execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads test definitions and the pytest.mark.order decorator for specifying test order dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or hardcoded secrets; the code is straightforward test setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest, defines two simple test functions, and uses the pytest-order plugin to specify the execution order. It contains no external data inputs, no network or system calls, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is simple and conventional for pytest usage. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest test file illustrating test ordering; there is no malicious intent or security risk detected.",
