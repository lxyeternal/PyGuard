  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of pytest's ordering feature with the --order-group-scope option, mainly for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines test functions with ordering annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard pytest features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two test functions, 'test1' and 'test2'. 'test2' is marked to run before 'test1' using pytest.mark.order. This is a simple test ordering setup for pytest and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no external inputs, data manipulation, or suspicious code constructs. The comments provide documentation links but do not introduce any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of pytest test ordering, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
