{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of pytest's order plugin to control test execution order, specifically using the --order-group-scope option.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines test functions with ordering annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses pytest markers to specify test execution order, which is normal for testing purposes. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two simple test functions, 'test1' and 'test2'. 'test2' is marked to run before 'test1' using the 'order' marker. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with standard testing practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test script demonstrating test ordering using pytest. It contains no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
