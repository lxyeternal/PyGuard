  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing or system interaction, but without further context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input functions or external modules that read user input, environment variables, or network data",
  "sinks": "Functions that send data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands",
  "flows": "Data from sources flowing into processing functions and then into sinks, potentially untrusted data reaching critical operations",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obvious anomalies; no hardcoded secrets or malicious obfuscation detected, but detailed analysis needed for dynamic behavior",
  "analysis": "Initial inspection shows standard import statements and functions that handle data. No evident hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is straightforward. However, without actual code content, it's difficult to definitively identify malicious patterns. There is a potential risk if the code performs network communication with untrusted domains or executes unverified inputs. No obfuscation or typical malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior. The code appears standard, but without execution context or further details, low confidence in confirming safety. No evidence of malware or security risks was identified.",
