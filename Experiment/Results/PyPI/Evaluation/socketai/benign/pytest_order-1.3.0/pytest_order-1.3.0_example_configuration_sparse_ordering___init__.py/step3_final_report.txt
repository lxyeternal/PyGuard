  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, external API calls.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, network requests, or environment variable reads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. Input sources are standard, and sinks are benign. No suspicious data flows or anomalies identified. The lack of code or benign code snippets results in low risk and malware scores. The risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2 due to potential external interactions, but no concrete evidence supports higher threat levels. Confidence in benign assessment is high (above 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scoring is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low risk scores reflecting cautious but justified assessment. No further action required.",
