{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates the use of pytest's --order-group-scope option via test markers.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static code with test function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely illustrative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward test definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two test functions, one marked with an order marker. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no security risks or malware. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, illustrative pytest test file demonstrating test ordering. There are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The current assessment and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
