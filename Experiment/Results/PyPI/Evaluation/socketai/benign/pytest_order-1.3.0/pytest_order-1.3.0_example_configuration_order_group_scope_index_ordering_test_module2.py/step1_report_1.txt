  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of pytest with an order marker for test execution sequencing.",
  "sources": "The code reads test definitions and markers within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present; no sinks that could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the flow is limited to test function execution control.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and standard for pytest tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, defines two test functions, and uses a pytest marker to specify execution order. There is no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity. It appears to be a standard test setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script demonstrating pytest's ordering capabilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
