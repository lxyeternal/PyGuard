{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of pytest for testing, specifically illustrating the --order-group-scope option and ordering test execution.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially harmful output or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply defines tests with no data handling or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard testing constructs with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and defines two simple test functions, with one marked to run first via @pytest.mark.order(1). There are no external data reads, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The content aligns with standard testing practices and documentation references. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest test file used for demonstrating ordering options. It shows no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It is benign and aligned with normal testing practices.",
