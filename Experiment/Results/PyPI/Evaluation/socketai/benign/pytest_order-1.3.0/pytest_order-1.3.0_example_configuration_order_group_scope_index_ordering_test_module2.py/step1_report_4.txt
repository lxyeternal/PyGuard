{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a test file demonstrating the use of pytest's order marker for controlling test execution sequence.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the test functions (test1, test2), which are invoked during test runs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects other parts of the system or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "The test functions are executed in sequence based on the order marker; no data flows from source to sink with malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and documentation-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest, defines two simple test functions, and uses pytest.mark.order to set execution order for test1. The test2 function is unmarked, so it runs after test1. The code does not include any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a minimal example for documentation or testing ordering capabilities within pytest. No external data inputs or sinks are used that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example demonstrating test order configuration in pytest. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks.",
