{
  "purpose": "The code is a test file demonstrating the use of pytest's --order-group-scope option for test execution order configuration.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code relies on pytest's internal testing framework.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply defines and orders test functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and serves as an example or test configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and defines two test functions. The first function is marked with a specific order using pytest.mark.order(1), while the second is a standard test with no specified order. The code contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a simple illustrative example for test ordering with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test configuration example demonstrating pytest's test ordering feature. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
