  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility designed for managing Daphne server instances and message exchange in a controlled environment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external data exfiltration. The primary security concern is the use of pickle for state storage, which warrants caution but is acceptable within testing contexts. Overall, the code is safe with low malware and obfuscation risk, and a slightly elevated but acceptable security risk due to pickle usage."
