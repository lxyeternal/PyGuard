  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurate description of request handling, WebSocket upgrade, and response management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The WebSocket upgrade process is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.9), no obfuscation, malware, or high security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, with no malicious activity. The WebSocket upgrade logic is typical, header validation is appropriate, and error handling is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed flow description.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. WebSocket upgrade is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (0.9), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. The header sanitization and WebSocket handling are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly describes request parsing, WebSocket upgrade, and response flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Proxy header parsing is common practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical HTTP request handler with WebSocket support. No malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Consistent with the code's operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Standard request and WebSocket handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is a standard implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Correctly summarizes request validation, WebSocket upgrade, and response flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns. Header validation and proxy parsing are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears legitimate and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports confirm the code is present and functions as described.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores (around 0.2) are appropriate given the code's functionality and validation measures.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** The code handles WebSocket upgrades, header validation, and request processing securely, with no malicious payloads or covert channels detected.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Can stay at **0.2**; standard web server code with proper validation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured HTTP/WebSocket request handler with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
