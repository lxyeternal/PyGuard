{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket server protocol and factory using Autobahn and Twisted, handling connection lifecycle, message passing, and application creation with sanitization and error handling.",
  "sources": "Headers from incoming requests, transport peer and host information, application creation deferreds, message payloads (text and binary).",
  "sinks": "Application creation callback, message sending functions, connection close routines, error handling pathways.",
  "flows": "Request headers are sanitized and parsed; client and server addresses are extracted; application creation is deferred and linked to callbacks; messages are processed and forwarded; connection events trigger logs and state changes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no external malicious network calls, no backdoors or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard WebSocket server patterns, with header sanitization to prevent CVE-2015-0219, deferred application setup, and connection lifecycle management. No malicious signals, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. Error handling and logging are implemented appropriately. The security posture aligns with typical secure WebSocket server implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured WebSocket server implementation with no malicious or sabotage signals. It employs standard security practices, and no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected.",
