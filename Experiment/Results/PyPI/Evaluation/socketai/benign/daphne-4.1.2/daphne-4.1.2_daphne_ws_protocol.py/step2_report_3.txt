  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported observations against the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's handling of headers, connection info, and message flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious or malicious activity, no obfuscated code, and notes header sanitization to prevent CVE-2015-0219.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code appears secure and standard, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly summarizes connection management and application creation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, standard practices, header sanitization, and no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies it as legitimate, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes data flow and message handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard header sanitization.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment of a normal WebSocket server.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes connection setup, message flow, and error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, no covert data leaks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes a standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Summarizes connection management, message flow, and error handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies it as legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a typical WebSocket server implementation, with proper sanitization (notably to prevent CVE-2015-0219), standard error handling, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on zero malware risk. No malicious activity, backdoors, or external malicious communications are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero obfuscation detected across all reports.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting standard operational risks but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minor operational risks, but nothing concerning.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and well-reasoned, and their scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured WebSocket server implementation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n- Header sanitization and error handling are correctly implemented.\n- Overall security posture appears sound.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores provided in the reports are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is secure, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected.",
