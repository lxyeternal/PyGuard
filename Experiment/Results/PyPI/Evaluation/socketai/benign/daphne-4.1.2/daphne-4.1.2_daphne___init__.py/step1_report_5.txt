  "flows": "Read system version and platform info -> conditionally set asyncio event loop policy",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard compatibility fix based on environment conditions",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and platform to determine if a specific asyncio event loop policy should be set for Windows systems using Python 3.8 or higher. It conditionally imports asyncio and sets the WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy if criteria are met. This is a standard compatibility workaround and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment-specific configuration for asyncio and Twisted compatibility. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
