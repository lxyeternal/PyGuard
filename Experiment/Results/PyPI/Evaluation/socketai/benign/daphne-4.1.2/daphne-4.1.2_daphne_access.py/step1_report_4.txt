  "purpose": "Generate access logs in NCSA format for HTTP and WebSocket actions within an application.",
  "sources": "Details dictionary passed to the __call__ method, specifically 'client', 'method', 'path', 'status', 'size'.",
  "sinks": "The self.stream.write() method where log entries are written, potentially to a file or network stream.",
  "flows": "Data from the details dictionary flows through the __call__ method to the write_entry function, which formats and writes logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Uses current datetime without any external input, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a logging utility class that records various web and websocket actions. It relies on the 'details' parameter for data inputs, which are expected to be provided by the application. No user input is directly read within this code, reducing the risk of injection or malicious data manipulation. The write_entry method formats the log entries and writes them to a stream, with no evident insecure handling. No network communication or sensitive data handling beyond logging is present. The code appears to be straightforward, with standard logging behavior and no signs of malicious or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard logging utility without any evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, it appears safe for use.",
