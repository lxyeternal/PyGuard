{
  "purpose": "The code implements a logging utility for HTTP and WebSocket actions, formatting log entries and writing them to a provided stream.",
  "sources": "The 'details' dictionary providing 'client', 'method', 'path', 'status', 'size' for HTTP; 'client' and 'path' for WebSocket; timestamp generated via datetime.datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "The write_entry method writes formatted log entries to the stream; no external data transfer occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'details' flows into formatted strings in write_entry, which then writes to the stream.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of datetime.datetime.now() is standard but not timezone-aware.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, benign logging class that records HTTP and WebSocket actions. It uses standard Python libraries, with no external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The data flow is limited to formatting and writing logs. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of current system time and string formatting is typical for such utilities. The code's purpose is purely for logging, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concerns related to logging practices.",
