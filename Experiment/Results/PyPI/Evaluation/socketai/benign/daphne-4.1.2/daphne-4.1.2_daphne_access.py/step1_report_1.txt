  "purpose": "To generate access logs in NCSA format for HTTP and WebSocket actions, primarily for monitoring or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Details parameter in the __call__ method, which provides client info, request details, status, size, and path.",
  "sinks": "The stream.write() method, which outputs log entries to a specified stream (file or other output).",
  "flows": "Details from __call__ method flow into write_entry, which formats and writes log entries to the stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Uses standard datetime and string formatting for logs. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The class constructs log entries based on provided details, formatting data into standard log line formats. It uses current system time with datetime.datetime.now(), and outputs logs to the provided stream. No untrusted input is directly executed or evaluated; all data is incorporated into formatted strings for logging. The code appears to be a straightforward logging utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility designed for recording HTTP and WebSocket actions. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code segment.",
