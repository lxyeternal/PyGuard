  "purpose": "This code initializes a Django application configuration for the Daphne server, ensuring the server is imported early for proper startup.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django.apps, django.core.checks, and daphne.server; call to checks.register",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations based on untrusted input",
  "flows": "Importing modules at startup; registering a check during app readiness",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed. The code simply performs standard Django app setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django AppConfig subclass that ensures daphne.server is imported early and registers a custom check. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic is present. It appears to be standard application initialization code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Django app configuration script for Daphne, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
