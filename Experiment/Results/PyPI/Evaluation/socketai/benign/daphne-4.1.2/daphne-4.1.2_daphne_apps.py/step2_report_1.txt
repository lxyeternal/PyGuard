  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward, importing modules, registering a check, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This aligns with the report's conclusion.\n- **Justification:** The code performs standard Django app configuration; no malicious activity, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, the code is standard setup.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Consistent with the report.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The early import of `daphne.server` is justified by the comment and standard practice.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The risk score is slightly above zero, possibly due to the early import comment, but this does not constitute a security risk.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the minimal risk score is acceptable as a precaution.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score could be lowered to 0, but 0.2 is not unreasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code registers a check; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This is consistent.\n- **Justification:** Routine Django setup.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to previous reports.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.2. Given the code's simplicity and standard practice, a risk score of 0 is appropriate for all.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code in question is standard Django configuration for Daphne server integration.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The small risk score in report 3 could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
