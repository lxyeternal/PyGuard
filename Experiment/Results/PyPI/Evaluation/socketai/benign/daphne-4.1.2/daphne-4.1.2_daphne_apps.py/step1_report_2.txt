{
  "purpose": "Configure a Django application for Daphne server integration and ensure the reactor is loaded early.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django.apps, django.core.checks, and daphne.server; import of local check function check_daphne_installed.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and registration of a Django AppConfig with a custom check during startup; no data flow from external sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns or obfuscation; imported modules are standard for server setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and the Daphne server module to ensure early initialization of the server components. It registers a custom check during the app's readiness phase to verify Daphne's installation. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code obfuscation. The import of daphne.server is standard for integrating Daphne with Django, and the check registration is a common practice for custom Django checks. Overall, the code appears to be a standard configuration module with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django app configuration for Daphne, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard setup tasks and register checks without handling untrusted input or executing suspicious operations.",
