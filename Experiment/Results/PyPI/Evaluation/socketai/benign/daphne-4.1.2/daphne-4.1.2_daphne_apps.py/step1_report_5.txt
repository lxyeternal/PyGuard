  "purpose": "Configure the Daphne application within a Django project, ensuring early import of the server for compatibility with other packages.",
  "sources": "Import statements: django.apps, django.core, daphne.server, and local checks module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is being written to external systems or networks.",
  "flows": "The code initializes application configuration and registers a health check, without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The import of daphne.server is standard for ASGI server integration. The check registration is typical Django pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for Django app configuration and server initialization, registers a check to verify Daphne installation, and does not perform any network or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, typical for Django apps, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django application configuration snippet for integrating Daphne. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and aligned with normal application setup procedures.",
