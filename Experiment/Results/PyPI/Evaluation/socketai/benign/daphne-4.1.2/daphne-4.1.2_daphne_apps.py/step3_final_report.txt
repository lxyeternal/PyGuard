  "purpose": "Configure Django application with early import of Daphne server and register a check for Daphne installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django.apps, django.core.checks, and daphne.server; registration of check_daphne_installed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code performs standard module imports and check registration.",
  "flows": "Import of daphne.server ensures the reactor is loaded before other modules; registration of check_daphne_installed occurs during app readiness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; early import comment is standard practice, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django AppConfig subclass that imports necessary modules, including daphne.server early to ensure the server reactor is initialized before other packages may import it. It registers a custom check check_daphne_installed during app startup. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The import of daphne.server is standard for Daphne integration, and the registration of checks is routine. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal risk score in some reports is justified by the early import comment, but this is common practice and not risky. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation. The security risk score is effectively 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django configuration snippet for integrating Daphne ASGI server. It contains no malicious, suspicious, or security-compromising behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate, with no need for adjustments.",
