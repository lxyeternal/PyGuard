  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard Django AppConfig subclass, importing necessary modules, registering a check, and importing `daphne.server` early.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code performs typical setup tasks for integrating Daphne with Django.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is straightforward and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), consistent with the clear, standard code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any activity that would warrant a high risk score.\n   - The code is purely for application setup; no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain low, around 0 or 0.1.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports agree on malware score 0.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - Importing `daphne.server` is standard for Daphne integration, not malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - They do not overstate potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, as there's no evident security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard Django configuration snippet with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms that the code is safe and poses no security concerns.",
