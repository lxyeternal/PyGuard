{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Django application configuration for the Daphne server, registering a custom check to ensure Daphne is installed.",
  "sources": "Import statements: django.apps, django.core.checks, and local module .checks; execution of check_daphne_installed during app readiness.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands. It primarily registers a check within the Django framework.",
  "flows": "On app startup, the 'ready' method registers a check function, which is part of Django's validation process. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward Django app setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and registers a custom check for the Daphne server during Django app initialization. No external data input, no network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The comment indicates a concern about the reactor, but the code itself does not execute or manipulate the reactor or perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration for Daphne, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs routine registration of a check with no suspicious or harmful actions.",
