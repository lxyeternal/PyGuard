  "purpose": "Configure and initialize the Daphne server within a Django application, ensuring the reactor is loaded early.",
  "sources": "Import statements: django.apps, django.core.checks, daphne.server, and local module .checks",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to potential usage of the Daphne server and custom checks, but no execution or data flow indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The comment suggests intentional early import of server components.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django app configuration and checks modules, then explicitly imports the Daphne server to ensure it loads early, which is standard for integrating Daphne with Django. The check_daphne_installed function is registered for static files validation. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, and the only notable aspect is the early import of daphne.server, which is justified by the comment. No anomalies or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django application configuration for integrating Daphne, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It’s a typical setup pattern with no suspicious activity.",
