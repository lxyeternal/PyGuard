  "purpose": "To check if the Daphne app is listed before django.contrib.staticfiles in INSTALLED_APPS within a Django project.",
  "sources": "django.core.checks, django.apps.apps.get_app_configs, imported DaphneConfig, StaticFilesConfig",
  "sinks": "Error reporting mechanism when order is incorrect",
  "flows": "App configuration iteration → isinstance checks → error returned if StaticFilesConfig appears before DaphneConfig",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The import of DaphneConfig is standard for plugin checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django system check that inspects app configurations to ensure Daphne appears before staticfiles. It performs standard imports, iterates through app configs, and returns an error if staticfiles is encountered before Daphne. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The imports are standard Django practices, and the code performs a simple ordering validation without side effects or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django system check for app ordering, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely serves to enforce configuration correctness.",
