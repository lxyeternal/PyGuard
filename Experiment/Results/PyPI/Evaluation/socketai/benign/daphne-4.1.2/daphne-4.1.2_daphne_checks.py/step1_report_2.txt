{
  "purpose": "To enforce the correct ordering of 'Daphne' and 'staticfiles' apps in Django's INSTALLED_APPS configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django apps and configurations, especially 'apps.get_app_configs()' which reads app configurations during runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potential error reporting via 'Error' objects if the app order is incorrect.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of app configurations -> check for 'DaphneConfig' -> if not found, check for 'StaticFilesConfig' -> report error if order is incorrect.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a simple configuration check; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code registers a Django system check that iterates over installed app configurations to verify if 'DaphneConfig' is listed before 'StaticFilesConfig'. If not, it raises a configuration error. The logic is straightforward, focusing on configuration validation without executing external code, network operations, or handling untrusted input. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected. The code's structure is clear and typical for Django system checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django configuration check that verifies app ordering for proper application startup. It does not contain any malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility ensuring correct app configuration order.",
