{
  "purpose": "The code is a Django system check to verify that the 'daphne' app is listed before 'django.contrib.staticfiles' in INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.apps, django.contrib.staticfiles, and daphne.apps; the function apps.get_app_configs() reads the application configuration list.",
  "sinks": "The code's logic influences the order in which Django app configurations are checked, but it does not write or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves app configs via get_app_configs() and checks their types; it then returns errors based on the order, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code performs a straightforward configuration check. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script registers a Django check to ensure correct app ordering. It imports necessary modules, iterates over installed apps, and raises an error if 'django.contrib.staticfiles' appears before 'daphne'. There are no signs of malicious intent or unusual behavior; the code is standard for Django project validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django system check for app order validation, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It performs a configuration validation task typical in Django projects.",
