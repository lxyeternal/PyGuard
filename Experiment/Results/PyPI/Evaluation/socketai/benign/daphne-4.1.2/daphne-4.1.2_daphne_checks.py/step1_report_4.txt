  "purpose": "Django system check to ensure Daphne app is listed before static files app in INSTALLED_APPS",
  "sources": "Imports from django.core.checks, django.apps, django.contrib.staticfiles.apps, and daphne.apps; app_configs parameter",
  "sinks": "Return of Error object with a specific message; no external data sink or network activity",
  "flows": "Application configs are checked for instances of DaphneConfig and StaticFilesConfig; based on type, returns error or empty list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple check on app configuration instances to ensure a specific order in INSTALLED_APPS. It imports necessary modules and defines a registered check function. The function iterates over app configs to verify the presence of DaphneConfig before StaticFilesConfig, returning an error if the order is incorrect. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to serve a standard configuration validation purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django check implementation to enforce app ordering for correctness. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
