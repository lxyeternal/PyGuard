  "purpose": "Django system check to verify that the 'daphne' app is listed before 'staticfiles' in INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.core.checks, django.apps, django.contrib.staticfiles.apps, and daphne.apps; iterates over app configs to check order.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only configuration validation logic.",
  "flows": "Iterates over app configs; if DaphneConfig is found, returns no error; if StaticFilesConfig appears before DaphneConfig, returns an error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward configuration check; no obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, standard Django validation to ensure correct app order. It imports necessary modules, iterates over app configs, and reports an error if 'staticfiles' appears before 'daphne'. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The logic is clear and typical for such checks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Slight improvements could include explicitly comparing positions in the list, but this does not impact security assessment. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports accurately reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django configuration validation script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with its behavior. No further action needed.",
