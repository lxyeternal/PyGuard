  "purpose": "Django system check to ensure daphne app is listed before staticfiles in INSTALLED_APPS.",
  "sources": "get_app_configs() from Django apps registry, and imported DaphneConfig and StaticFilesConfig.",
  "sinks": "Returning Error objects if order is incorrect, which may affect system behavior but not directly execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Iterates through app configs to check for DaphneConfig and StaticFilesConfig and returns errors if order is wrong.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and the Daphne app configuration. It iterates through installed app configs, checks for instances of DaphneConfig and StaticFilesConfig, and issues an error if StaticFilesConfig appears before DaphneConfig. The logic is simple and typical for Django system checks, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. It is a standard validation script to enforce app ordering, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Django system check script that enforces correct app ordering for Daphne and static files. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
