      "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing utility designed for managing Daphne server instances and message exchange in a controlled environment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external data exfiltration. The primary security concern is the use of pickle for state storage, which warrants caution but is acceptable within testing contexts. Overall, the code is safe with low malware and obfuscation risk, and a slightly elevated but acceptable security risk due to pickle usage."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical server launcher CLI with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk stems from the dynamic import of application modules, which could be exploited if untrusted input is provided. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security posture is acceptable for trusted environments, with a slight inherent risk due to dynamic code execution."

The primary security concern is the potential misuse of dynamic import with untrusted input, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The overall security posture is low risk, but caution should be exercised when using import_by_path with unvalidated data."
