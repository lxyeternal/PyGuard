  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for importing objects, extracting header values, and parsing X-Forwarded-For headers. It notes no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It highlights that dynamic import via `importlib.import_module()` could be risky if input is untrusted, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only concern is the dynamic import, which is acknowledged. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that dynamic import can be risky if used with untrusted input, but no malicious payloads are detected. It correctly notes the potential danger of `import_by_path`.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The malware score remains 0, and the security risk is low. The concern about untrusted input is valid but not indicative of malicious code.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard header parsing and dynamic import functions. It emphasizes that while `import_by_path` can be dangerous if misused, no malicious behavior is present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is benign, with the main risk being the potential misuse of dynamic import if inputs are untrusted.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the fact that the code handles headers and dynamic import, with no evidence of malicious activity. It notes that malformed headers could cause runtime errors but not malicious ones.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that dynamic import based on user input could lead to code execution if not sanitized, but no malicious activity is evident. It assigns a higher security risk (0.4) due to the potential danger of untrusted dynamic import.\n\n- **Assessment:** This is a cautious but reasonable stance. The code itself doesn't perform malicious actions, but the potential for misuse exists if inputs are not validated.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Given the potential for exploitation via untrusted input, increasing the malware score slightly to reflect the risk might be justified, but since no actual malware is present, keeping it at 0 is acceptable. The security risk score of 0.4 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious code detected. The main concern is the dynamic import's potential misuse, not actual malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** While the code itself isn't malicious, the use of dynamic import with untrusted input introduces a security risk. The highest report (Report 5) assigns 0.4, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2 to 0.4** depending on context. Since the code is utility functions, and no validation is shown, a moderate risk (0.3) seems appropriate.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, serving standard purposes. The main security concern is the potential misuse of `import_by_path` if inputs are not sanitized. No actual malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores in the reports are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThese reflect the benign nature but acknowledge the inherent risks of dynamic import with untrusted input.",
