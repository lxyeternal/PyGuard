  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for importing objects dynamically, processing HTTP headers, and parsing X-Forwarded-For headers in a web server context.",
  "sources": "Reading header data via header_value(), reading headers from a headers object, input to import_by_path()",
  "sinks": "Return values from parse_x_forwarded_for(), header_value() returns decoded header data",
  "flows": "Headers data -> header_value() -> parse_x_forwarded_for() returns host/port info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of dynamic importlib.import_module() can be risky if input is untrusted, but here it appears as a utility function, not automatically invoked with user input.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard header parsing, dynamic importing, and header processing. The import_by_path() function relies on user-supplied strings but does not evaluate or execute untrusted code directly; it uses importlib.import_module() and getattr() which can be risky if inputs are malicious, but no immediate malicious behavior is evident. The header_value() function decodes header bytes without sanitization, but this is typical. parse_x_forwarded_for() safely processes headers, extracting host and port information with proper type conversions and default fallbacks. No evidence of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code is structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility functions for HTTP header processing and dynamic imports, with no apparent malicious intent or malware. It does not handle untrusted data in a way that would cause security issues beyond the inherent risks of dynamic importing, which depend on input sanitization outside this snippet. Overall, it appears to be a benign, utility-focused module.",
