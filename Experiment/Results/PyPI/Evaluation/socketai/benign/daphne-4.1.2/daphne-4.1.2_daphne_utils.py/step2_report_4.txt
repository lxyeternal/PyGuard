  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Dynamic import could be risky if input is untrusted, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable, given the potential risk of dynamic import if misused.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is utility-focused, with no malicious intent. The main concern is the use of dynamic import with untrusted input, which is acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that dynamic import via `importlib.import_module()` can be dangerous if input is untrusted. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the potential risk but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard header parsing and dynamic import functions, with risks associated with untrusted input but no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Well-aligned with the code's purpose and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; no signs of malicious activity, but warns about risks of dynamic import if used improperly.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the risk of dynamic import if input is untrusted but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 — slightly higher, perhaps reflecting the potential danger of dynamic import.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score is acceptable given the potential for code execution if inputs are malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Review:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malware, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward utility functions.\n- **Use of dynamic import:** While potentially risky if misused, the code does not perform any malicious actions itself. The risk stems from how the functions are used externally.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Header processing:** Standard, safe, and non-malicious.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports appropriately assign malware scores of 0, with risk scores reflecting the potential danger of dynamic import if inputs are untrusted.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0. The code does not contain any malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for dynamic import to execute arbitrary code if input is malicious, a risk score of around 0.2–0.4 is reasonable. Since the highest report assigns 0.4, I agree with that.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — acknowledging the inherent risk of dynamic import with untrusted input, but noting that the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign utility module for header processing and dynamic import, with potential security risks only if used improperly with untrusted input. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.",
