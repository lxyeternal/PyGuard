  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server launcher CLI with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk stems from the dynamic import of application modules, which could be exploited if untrusted input is provided. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security posture is acceptable for trusted environments, with a slight inherent risk due to dynamic code execution."
