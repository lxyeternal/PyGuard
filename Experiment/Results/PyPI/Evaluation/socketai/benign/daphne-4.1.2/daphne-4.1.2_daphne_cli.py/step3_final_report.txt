  "purpose": "CLI tool for configuring and starting a Django HTTP/WebSocket server, dynamically importing the application module specified by user input.",
  "sources": "User-supplied application path via command-line argument, environment variables, and command-line arguments influencing server configuration.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of application module (via import_by_path), server startup routines, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments -> dynamic import of application module -> server initialization and run.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on user input without explicit validation; no obfuscation or embedded malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI for server startup, with argument parsing, dynamic application import, and server configuration. The primary security concern is the dynamic import of a user-specified module, which could execute malicious code if the input is malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context. The main vulnerability is the potential misuse of dynamic import, which is common in such tools but should be used with trusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server launcher CLI with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk stems from the dynamic import of application modules, which could be exploited if untrusted input is provided. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security posture is acceptable for trusted environments, with a slight inherent risk due to dynamic code execution.",
