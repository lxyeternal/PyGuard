{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a command-line interface for configuring and running a Django HTTP/WebSocket server, parsing user inputs for server settings and application import.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments, specifically application path, host, port, socket options, and proxy headers.",
  "sinks": "Application import path execution, logging setup, server initialization, and server run method.",
  "flows": "Command-line args → configuration variables → application import → server setup → server run.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution beyond standard application import, and no data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs argument parsing, logging configuration, dynamic application import, and server initialization. It does not process or handle untrusted data inputs directly beyond command-line arguments. The application import relies on user-supplied string but is protected by import_by_path function and standard Python import mechanisms, with no evidence of malicious code execution. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are present. The code is structured and clear, with no obfuscation or unusual patterns. It uses standard libraries and conventional security practices, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard server startup CLI for a Django WebSocket server, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It uses user inputs for configuration, which is typical for such tools. There are no suspicious functions, hidden behaviors, or security risks identified in the provided code.",
