  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI for a Django server, with dynamic application import via `import_by_path`. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected. The main risk is executing arbitrary application code if the user supplies a malicious module path.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The risk is primarily from the dynamic import, which is standard but can be exploited if misused. No actual malware or malicious behavior is present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code handles argument parsing, dynamic import, and server setup without suspicious activity. No obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears safe, with the main concern being the standard dynamic import.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a CLI for server configuration, with no signs of malicious activity. The only potential risk is the dynamic import of user-supplied application code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard pattern with inherent risks if misused.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusions; no malicious behavior detected. The dynamic application import is the main point of concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malware, just the usual risk associated with dynamic imports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code is a typical CLI for server startup, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only noteworthy operation is dynamic application import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports agree that there is no malware present. The only potential risk stems from the dynamic import of user-specified application modules, which is a common pattern in server startup scripts but could be exploited if the supplied module path is malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None of the reports detect obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk:** The risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), which aligns with the fact that the main concern is the execution of arbitrary code via dynamic import, not malicious code embedded in this script.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores given are reasonable given the analysis. The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to potential misuse of dynamic import, but no actual malicious activity)\n\nThis code is a standard CLI wrapper for a server, with the main security concern being the execution of arbitrary application code if the user supplies a malicious module path. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the analysis above.",
