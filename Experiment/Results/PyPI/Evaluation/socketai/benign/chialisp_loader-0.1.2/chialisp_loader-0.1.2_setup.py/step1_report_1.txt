{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package with a single module 'chialisp_loader' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' to facilitate package setup.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as this is a static setup configuration without data input or output processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls the 'setup' function to define package metadata, specifically listing 'chialisp_loader' as a module. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network operations. The structure aligns with standard Python packaging practices. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, no anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
