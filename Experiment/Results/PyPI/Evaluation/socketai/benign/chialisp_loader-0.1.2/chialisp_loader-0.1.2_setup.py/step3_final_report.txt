  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining a package with a single module 'chialisp_loader'.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input, environment variables, or external data; static configuration only.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, minimal, and adheres to typical packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with a static list of modules. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. All reports correctly identify the code as benign. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately low; minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unwarranted and should be adjusted to 0. Given the simplicity and static nature, there are no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate; the slight elevation of security risk to 0.1 is unnecessary. Final assessment: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
