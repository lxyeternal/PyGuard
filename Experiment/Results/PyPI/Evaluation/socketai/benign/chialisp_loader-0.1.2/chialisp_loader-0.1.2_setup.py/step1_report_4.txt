  "purpose": "Configure the setup script for packaging a Python module named 'chialisp_loader'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call and the 'py_modules' argument specifying the module to include.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, user input, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code solely defines packaging configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() to define packaging parameters, specifically including a module named 'chialisp_loader'. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage. The code appears standard and straightforward for packaging a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a basic setup configuration for packaging a Python module, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
