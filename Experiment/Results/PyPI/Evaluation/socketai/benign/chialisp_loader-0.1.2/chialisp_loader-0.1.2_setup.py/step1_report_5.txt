  "purpose": "The code is configuring a Python package setup using setuptools, specifying a module named 'chialisp_loader'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name 'chialisp_loader' for packaging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the module name for packaging; there are no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script that defines packaging parameters using setuptools. It specifies a single module to be included in the package. There are no input sources other than static string literals, no data transformations, and no execution of dynamic code or external data. It is a straightforward configuration file without any embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
