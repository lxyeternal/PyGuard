{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, specifying a module named 'chialisp_loader' for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package configuration and the 'chialisp_loader' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads package metadata and module names; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'setuptools' to define package setup details. It specifies a single module 'chialisp_loader' for inclusion in the package. There are no inputs, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
