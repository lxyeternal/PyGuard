  "purpose": "This code loads resources and programs from Python packages, potentially rebuilding resources on demand.",
  "sources": "User-supplied package and resource_path inputs in load_resource and load_program functions.",
  "sinks": "load_resource returns bytes read from package resources; load_program decodes bytes to string and creates a Program object.",
  "flows": "Input package and resource_path -> load_resource reads and returns bytes -> load_program decodes bytes to UTF-8 string -> Program.fromhex processes the string.",
  "anomalies": "The use of build_on_demand to rebuild resources could be a concern if it executes untrusted code; however, it's conditional and optional. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code relies on standard library functions and a third-party library, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads resources from packages using importlib_resources, with an optional rebuild step via build_on_demand. The flow from input to resource loading and decoding appears straightforward. No dangerous code injection or malicious behavior is present. The conditional import and use of build_on_demand suggest flexibility but do not introduce security risks. The decoding and processing of resources via load_program are standard procedures, assuming trusted package contents. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard resource loader with optional rebuilding capabilities. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. It performs safe resource access and processing based on provided package and resource paths.",
