  "purpose": "Load package resources, optionally rebuild them, and convert hex-encoded data into Program objects.",
  "sources": "Resource files accessed via as_file and files().joinpath() within the package.",
  "sinks": "load_resource decodes bytes as UTF-8 and passes to Program.fromhex(), which could process malicious hex data if resources are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Resource bytes -> decode('utf8') -> Program.fromhex()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Optional build_on_demand is a benign development feature.",
  "analysis": "The code loads resources from a package, optionally rebuilds them via a no-op or a provided function, decodes the resource bytes as UTF-8, and converts the decoded string into a Program object using fromhex(). There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external network interactions. The optional dependency is handled gracefully. The main security consideration is the processing of potentially malicious resource data, which could exploit vulnerabilities in Program.fromhex() if the resource content is malicious. However, the code itself is straightforward and benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature but acknowledge the potential risk if resource files are untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource loader with optional rebuild capability, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is processing untrusted resource data, which could be malicious if resource files are compromised. The assigned scores are consistent with this assessment, and no modifications are necessary.",
