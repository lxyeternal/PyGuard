{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load resource files from a package and convert them into a Program object, likely for executing or manipulating the loaded data.",
  "sources": "Reading resource files via `as_file` and `files(package).joinpath(resource_path)`; calling `load_resource()` which reads bytes from the resource.",
  "sinks": "Decoding resource bytes as UTF-8 and passing them to `Program.fromhex()`; no external or untrusted input is directly used as command execution or network operations.",
  "flows": "Resource file is loaded via `load_resource()`, bytes are decoded, then passed to `Program.fromhex()` to create a program object.",
  "anomalies": "The use of `build_on_demand()` as a no-op fallback might suggest optional resource rebuilding, but it does not perform any suspicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads package resources, optionally rebuilds them if `build_on_demand()` is available, then decodes and converts the data into a `Program`. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The optional dependency handling indicates a development or build-time feature, not runtime malicious activity. Overall, the code functions as a resource loader with no apparent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource loader designed to load and decode package data into a Program object. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
