  "purpose": "Load and process resource files from a Python package, specifically `.hex` files, and convert them into Program objects.",
  "sources": "The function load_resource reads data from package resources via as_file and files methods; load_program calls load_resource to get data.",
  "sinks": "The decoded resource data is passed to Program.fromhex, which interprets the data as a hexadecimal string to create a Program object.",
  "flows": "load_program calls load_resource, which reads resource bytes; then data is decoded to UTF-8 and fed into Program.fromhex.",
  "anomalies": "Use of optional dependency 'runtime_builder' that is silently ignored; no suspicious or hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code reads resource files from a package, decodes them as UTF-8, and converts hexadecimal data into Program objects using a third-party library. The optional dependency 'runtime_builder' is used to rebuild resources if installed but fails silently otherwise, indicating no malicious intent. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. The code does not perform any suspicious or unsafe operations beyond standard resource loading and processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard resource loader for hex-encoded Program objects, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external libraries and optional dependencies, but none are used maliciously. The overall security risk is low.",
