  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input",
  "flows": "None; static data used directly in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'pypi.org' resembles an official domain, potentially misleading",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script with no dynamic behavior, input, or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The only notable aspect is the package name, which resembles an official domain and could be used for impersonation or social engineering, but this is a social concern rather than a technical security issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only concern is the package name's potential for misleading users, which does not constitute malicious code but warrants caution. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2 due to the misleading name.",
