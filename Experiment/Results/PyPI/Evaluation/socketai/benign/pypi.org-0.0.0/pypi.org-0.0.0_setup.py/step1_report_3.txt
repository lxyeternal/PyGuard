{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name and version",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no external inputs or dynamic data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hidden or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with hardcoded package name and version, and an empty packages list. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. This appears to be a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
