  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata definition",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with basic metadata: name, version, and empty packages list. There are no input sources, external data, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or unusual patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard, minimal package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata for distribution.",
