  "purpose": "Define constants for the GCPC image, including image name and tag with version.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'version' from google_cloud_pipeline_components and the assignment of GCPC_IMAGE_TAG.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted data sinks; the code only assigns constants and imports version information.",
  "flows": "Import retrieves version info; assignment constructs image tag string using this version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be straightforward configuration and versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version module from a Google Cloud pipeline component, then defines constants for a Docker image name and tag, appending the version. There is no user input, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve as a static configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration module defining constants for an image name and tag using a version imported from a trusted package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
