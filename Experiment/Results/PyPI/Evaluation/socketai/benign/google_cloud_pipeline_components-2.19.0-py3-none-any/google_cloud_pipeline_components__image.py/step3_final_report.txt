  "purpose": "Define constants for a Google Cloud Pipeline image name and tag based on a trusted version module.",
  "sources": "Import of version from google_cloud_pipeline_components; usage in constructing image tag.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration.",
  "flows": "Import of version -> construction of image tag string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a trusted package and constructs constants for image name and tag. It involves no user input, dynamic execution, or external data handling. The code is purely configuration, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration snippet for setting image constants using a trusted package version. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
