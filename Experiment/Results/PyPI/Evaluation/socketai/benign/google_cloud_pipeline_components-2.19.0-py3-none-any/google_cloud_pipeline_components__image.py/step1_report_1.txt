  "purpose": "Define constants for the GCPC image including image name and tag based on version.",
  "sources": "Importing version from google_cloud_pipeline_components and accessing version.__version__.",
  "targets": "Using the version string to create a Docker image tag.",
  "flows": "Import version -> assign image name -> concatenate to form image tag.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Code is straightforward and intended for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version number from an external module and constructs image-related constants. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The use of version information for tagging is standard practice. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet for setting up constants, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
