  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is straightforward: importing a version number from an external module and constructing constants for image name and tag.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input, or untrusted data sources are involved.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n   - The code serves a configuration purpose, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple, static, and configuration-related.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent.\n   - The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious activity.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is a simple, static configuration snippet for defining constants related to Docker images, using version info from a trusted module.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Final conclusion**:\nThe code is safe, benign, and standard for configuration purposes. No security concerns are present.",
