  "purpose": "Define constants for the Google Cloud Pipeline Components image, including the image name and version tag.",
  "sources": "Importing version information from 'google_cloud_pipeline_components' package; defining string constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version number from a package and constructs an image tag string. No input/output operations, user input handling, or data processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be configuration-related and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet that defines constants for a container image. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
