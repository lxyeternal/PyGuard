  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code imports a `version` object from the `google_cloud_pipeline_components` package.\n   - It defines two constants:\n     - `GCPC_IMAGE_NAME` as a static string.\n     - `GCPC_IMAGE_TAG` by concatenating the image name with the version string obtained from `version.__version__`.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code performs straightforward constant definitions.\n   - It does not accept user input, read external data dynamically, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations.\n   - The imported `version` is from a trusted package, and its value is used solely for version tagging.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious side effects are evident.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is a benign configuration snippet.\n   - They highlight the straightforward nature of the code, the absence of anomalies, and the lack of malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, and the malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware Score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Correctly 0; no evident security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only assumption is that `version.__version__` is from a trusted source, which seems valid given the context.\n   - There are no indications of supply chain issues or malicious code injection.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard configuration snippet.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n   - No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, trusted configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect that. No further action or revision is necessary.",
