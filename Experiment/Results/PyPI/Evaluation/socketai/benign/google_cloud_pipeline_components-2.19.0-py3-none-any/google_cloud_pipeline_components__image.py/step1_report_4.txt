  "purpose": "Define constants for the Google Cloud Pipeline Components (GCPC) image, including image name and tag based on version.",
  "sources": "Import statement for version from google_cloud_pipeline_components",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; only assignment of constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions and import",
  "analysis": "The code imports the version module from google_cloud_pipeline_components and defines constants for image name and tag. The image tag dynamically incorporates the version number from the imported module. No user input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be standard for setting configuration constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup for constants, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
