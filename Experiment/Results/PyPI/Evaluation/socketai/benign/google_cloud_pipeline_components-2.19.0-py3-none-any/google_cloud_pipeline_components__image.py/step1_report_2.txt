{
  "purpose": "Define constants for the GCPC image, including image name and tag, for use in Google Cloud Pipeline components.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'version' module from 'google_cloud_pipeline_components', and referencing 'version.__version__' for the image tag.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or insecure operations observed.",
  "flows": "The version.__version__ value is used to dynamically generate the image tag, but it is sourced from an imported module, not user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version module to retrieve the current version of the package, then constructs a Docker image name and tag string. There are no inputs, user data, or external calls that could be malicious. The code's simplicity and use of static constants suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a basic purpose of defining constants and does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a standard configuration snippet.",
