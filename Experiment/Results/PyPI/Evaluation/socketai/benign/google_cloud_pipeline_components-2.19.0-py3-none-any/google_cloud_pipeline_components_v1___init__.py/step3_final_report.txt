  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data flows, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static comments and licensing information, with no functions, variables, or logic. No data input, external calls, or data flows are present. The code is purely documentation, which inherently cannot be malicious or obfuscated. The assessments across reports correctly identify this, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence (1). There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The static nature and lack of executable elements confirm the benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign documentation and licensing information with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
