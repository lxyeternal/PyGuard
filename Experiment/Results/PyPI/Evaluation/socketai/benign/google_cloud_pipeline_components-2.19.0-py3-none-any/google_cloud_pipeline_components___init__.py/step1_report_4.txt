  "purpose": "The script provides licensing information, imports modules, and issues a version-related warning for Python version compatibility in Google Cloud Pipeline Components.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'sys' module, the 'warnings' module, and the 'google_cloud_pipeline_components.version' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; no data leaks or security effects are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script mainly issues a warning based on the Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs standard version checking and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and warning modules, checks the Python version, and issues a warning if the version is below 3.9. It only includes licensing info and version import, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or handling of sensitive data. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving to issue a warning about Python version support for the Google Cloud Pipeline Components. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
