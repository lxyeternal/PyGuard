  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Malicious-like Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily licensing comments, import statements, and a version check warning.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or other malicious actions.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code reads system info (`sys.version_info`) and issues a warning if the Python version is below 3.9.\n   - It imports version info from `google_cloud_pipeline_components.version`.\n   - The purpose is to inform users about upcoming deprecation/support issues.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Anomalies:**\n   - No untrusted data sources, no external data fetching beyond standard modules, and no data sinks that could leak information.\n   - No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for environment compatibility warnings.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is benign.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, but given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Any Potential Issues or Overestimations?**\n   - No. The reports seem to have assessed the code accurately.\n   - The code is purely informational, with no security implications beyond the warning.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign component that performs environment checks and issues warnings. It does not perform any risky or malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Score | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior present                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation evident             |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No security vulnerabilities or risky operations identified |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
