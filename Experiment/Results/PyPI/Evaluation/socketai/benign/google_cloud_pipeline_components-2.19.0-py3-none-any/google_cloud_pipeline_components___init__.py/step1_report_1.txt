  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; version info and warnings are static or system-derived.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; only a version check warning and license comments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing comments, import statements, and a conditional warning about Python version support.
