  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a licensing comment, import statements (`sys`, `warnings`, and a version module), and a conditional warning if Python version < 3.9.\n- The code performs a simple environment check and issues a warning; it does not perform any data transmission, external network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is standard for environment compatibility warnings and license documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Malware**: No malicious actions are evident. The code only issues a warning based on system info.\n- **Obfuscated**: The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk**: None apparent; the code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or modify system state beyond issuing a warning.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or security issues are identified.\n- The code is minimal and standard, serving a benign purpose.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity).\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code).\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk).\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- The code does not perform any risky operations.\n- The warning is informational, not harmful.\n- No external data, secrets, or backdoors are involved.\n\n### Consistency with report descriptions:\n- All reports agree on benignity and lack of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a standard, safe version check and warning script with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed. The code is safe and well-understood.",
