  "purpose": "This code defines part of the Google Cloud Pipeline Components, mainly to issue a version check warning and document licensing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function outputs a warning message; no data leaks or external data effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads sys.version_info and conditionally issues a warning; no untrusted data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and warnings modules, retrieves version info, and issues a deprecation warning if Python version is less than 3.9. It is a standard practice to warn users about upcoming deprecations. No external data is fetched, no suspicious code or backdoors are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign component warning about Python version support, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
