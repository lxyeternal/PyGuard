  "purpose": "Metadata and version declaration for the Kubeflow pipeline components.",
  "sources": "Comments containing licensing information, copyright notices, and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static metadata present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of comments and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with licensing comments, copyright notices, and a version string. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently low risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. No issues or suspicious behavior are detected or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard metadata/license/version header with no security concerns. The code poses no threat and is safe for supply chain use.",
