  "purpose": "Define placeholders for use in component authoring within a pipeline, specifically for Google Cloud and Vertex AI integration, with a utility function for escaping placeholders.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for placeholders, and the str() conversion of a placeholder object within the json_escape function.",
  "sinks": "The str() conversion of placeholder objects; the function outputs strings with placeholder values, but no direct untrusted data input or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "Placeholder variables are set as strings; the json_escape function transforms these strings but does not process untrusted external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code relies on placeholders and string manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several string placeholders meant to be substituted at runtime with runtime-specific values for cloud and pipeline configurations. The placeholders are simple strings with no external input handling. The json_escape function converts a placeholder object to string, then replaces '}}' with a string involving a level parameter, likely for escaping purposes. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated behavior. The code is straightforward and purpose-built for placeholder management with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing placeholders in pipeline configurations. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and performs straightforward string manipulations. Overall security risk is negligible.",
