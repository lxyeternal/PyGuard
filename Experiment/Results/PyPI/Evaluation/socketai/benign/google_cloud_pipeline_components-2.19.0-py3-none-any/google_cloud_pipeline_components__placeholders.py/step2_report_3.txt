  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is static placeholder definitions and a simple string manipulation function. No dynamic code execution, no external inputs, no secrets.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The function validates the level parameter and performs straightforward string replacement.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0.0 — no security risk detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBenign, safe, and standard utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The placeholders are static, and the function performs string conversion and replacement.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None apparent. The code is simple and purpose-built.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious behavior.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — negligible, justified by the string manipulation, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBenign, straightforward placeholder management.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Similar to previous, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None. The string replacement in `json_escape` is controlled and validated.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — very low, due to string manipulation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSafe utility code, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The string replacement may affect downstream processing but does not introduce security risks.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None. The code is consistent with templating practices.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — still very low, justified by the string operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBenign, utility code for placeholder handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. Similar to others, no malicious behavior or code injection.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None. The string manipulation is controlled and validated.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — transparent code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — minimal, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSafe, straightforward placeholder management.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All are very low (0.0–0.2). The code involves simple string manipulation and placeholder definitions, with no external inputs or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0**  \n  No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** **0.1**  \n  Slightly above zero due to string replacement, but this is benign and typical in templating utilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard utility module for managing placeholders in Kubeflow pipeline configurations. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low risk and malware scores. No changes necessary.",
