{
  "purpose": "Define placeholders for use in component authoring, particularly for Google Cloud and pipeline runtime variables, and provide a function for JSON escaping placeholders.",
  "sources": "Placeholder variable definitions, string conversion in json_escape function",
  "sinks": "The json_escape function manipulates string representations of placeholders, potentially affecting how placeholders are processed or injected",
  "flows": "Placeholder variables are used as template strings; json_escape transforms these string representations, which could affect subsequent processing or injection",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The json_escape function's string replacement may alter placeholder processing, but it appears to be a benign utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several string placeholders for pipeline runtime parameters, setting them to template strings. These placeholders are intended for runtime resolution. The json_escape function converts a placeholder to a string and replaces all occurrences of '}}' with a modified string involving .json_escape, which could influence downstream processing but is a straightforward string operation. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are present. Usage of placeholders and string replacement logic seems benign and consistent with templating practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of placeholder definitions and a utility function for string escaping. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. The only noteworthy aspect is the string manipulation in json_escape, which appears to be a safe utility for handling placeholders.",
