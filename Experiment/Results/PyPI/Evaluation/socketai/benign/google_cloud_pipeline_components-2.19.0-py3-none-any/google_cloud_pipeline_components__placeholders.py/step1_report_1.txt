  "purpose": "Define placeholders for use in Kubeflow pipeline component authoring and a utility function for JSON escaping placeholders.",
  "sources": "Placeholder string definitions (e.g., PROJECT_ID_PLACEHOLDER, LOCATION_PLACEHOLDER, etc.), and the json_escape function.",
  "sinks": "The json_escape function converts placeholders to strings and performs string replacement; potential risk if placeholders are manipulated or misused in other contexts.",
  "flows": "Placeholders are set at runtime and passed into json_escape, which converts them to strings and performs replacements. No untrusted input flows directly into critical security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for placeholder definitions and a utility function; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static placeholder string definitions used for runtime configuration in Kubeflow pipelines, with descriptive comments. The json_escape function takes a placeholder and a level, validates the level, converts the placeholder to string, and replaces occurrences of '}}' with a modified string, presumably for safe JSON serialization. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external network calls, and no execution of dynamic or malicious code. The code performs straightforward string manipulation with input validation. It adheres to standard practices for defining placeholders and utility functions for string escaping. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module defining placeholders and a simple string escaping function for use in pipeline configuration. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The code is straightforward and safe.",
