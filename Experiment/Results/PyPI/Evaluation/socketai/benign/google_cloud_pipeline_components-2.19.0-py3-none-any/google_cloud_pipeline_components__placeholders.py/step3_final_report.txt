  "purpose": "Define static placeholders for runtime substitution in Kubeflow pipeline components and provide a utility function for JSON escaping of placeholders.",
  "sources": "Placeholder string definitions and the json_escape function performing string conversion and replacement.",
  "sinks": "String conversion and replacement within the json_escape function; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Conversion of placeholder objects to strings followed by replacement of '}}' with escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string manipulation and static placeholder definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static template placeholders used during pipeline execution, with a utility function to escape JSON characters in placeholders. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no network or file operations. The string replacement in json_escape is controlled and validated. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets. The code is simple, purpose-built, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. The code functions as intended for placeholder management in Kubeflow pipelines and poses no security threat.",
