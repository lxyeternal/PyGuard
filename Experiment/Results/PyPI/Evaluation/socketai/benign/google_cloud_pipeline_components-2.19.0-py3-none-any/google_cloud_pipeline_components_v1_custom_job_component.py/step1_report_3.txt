  "purpose": "Define a Kubeflow pipeline component for launching a Vertex AI custom training job.",
  "sources": "Input arguments such as display_name, location, worker_pool_specs, service_account, network, labels, encryption_spec_key_name, persistent_resource_id, project, strategy, max_wait_duration; and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Builds a serverless custom job specification and outputs a serialized gcp_resources proto, which tracks the job.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> build_serverless_customjob_container_spec() function call -> output gcp_resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a pipeline component function that constructs a configuration payload for a Vertex AI custom training job. It utilizes imported modules to build the payload and does not include any network operations, data leaks, or insecure practices. The arguments are standard configuration parameters, with placeholders for dynamic values. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The code appears to be a typical, well-documented component for pipeline automation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate component definition for launching custom training jobs in Vertex AI. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It is safe and aligns with expected usage in pipeline components.",
