{
  "purpose": "Constructs a payload to launch a Vertex AI custom training job within Kubeflow pipelines, configuring parameters such as location, worker pools, and security options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters provided to the function, including placeholders for runtime resolution.",
  "sinks": "The utility function `build_serverless_customjob_container_spec` which generates the payload; no external data sinks or network calls within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into a dictionary structure and passed to the utility function for payload creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pipeline component that creates a configuration payload for Google Cloud Vertex AI custom training jobs. It uses well-known libraries and placeholders for dynamic resolution. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The parameters are typical for such a component, and the code's structure is straightforward and transparent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured component for orchestrating Vertex AI training jobs. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
