{
  "purpose": "Define various artifact classes representing Google Cloud Vertex AI and BigQuery resources, as well as evaluation metrics, for use in Kubeflow Pipelines.",
  "sources": "Constant string schemas, class method parameters, and internal variables such as resource names, URIs, and metadata objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily constructs resource representations and metadata objects.",
  "flows": "Class method inputs (names, URIs, resource identifiers) flow into artifact instantiation, resulting in objects with metadata and schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines data schemas and artifact creation methods. No suspicious network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of schema definitions and factory methods for creating artifact instances representing cloud resources and evaluation metrics. It uses standard text templates for schemas, straightforward class methods, and no dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code's purpose aligns with resource and metric modeling, typical for cloud SDKs or pipelines. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical artifact schema and factory implementation for Google Cloud resources within Kubeflow Pipelines. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful.",
