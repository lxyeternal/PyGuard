{
  "purpose": "Define various artifact classes representing Google Cloud resources and evaluation metrics for use in Kubeflow Pipelines.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class methods, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines data schemas and factory methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation detected. The code appears to be standard schema and artifact class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines schema-based artifact classes for Google Cloud resources within a Kubeflow Pipelines context. It employs standard Python features, type annotations, and class methods to instantiate artifacts with metadata. No network operations, command execution, or data manipulation from untrusted sources is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code structure and purpose align with typical SDK component definitions. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign schema and artifact class definitions module for Google Cloud resource representation in Kubeflow Pipelines. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
