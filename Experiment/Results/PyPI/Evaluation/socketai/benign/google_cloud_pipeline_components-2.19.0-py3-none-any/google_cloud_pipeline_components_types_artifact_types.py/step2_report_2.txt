  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues are present, consistent, and justified.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines artifact classes and schemas for Google Cloud resources, with static string schemas and resource identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no external calls, no obfuscation. It’s schema and factory method definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard resource modeling code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar artifact classes with resource URIs and creation methods.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code execution, network, or file operations. Data flows are straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also safe, typical SDK artifact definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines resource artifacts and metrics schemas.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, safe for supply chain.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Artifact classes with static URLs and schemas.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No external code or dynamic execution.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard SDK artifact definitions, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar resource artifact definitions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, typical schema code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe static class definitions, schema strings, and resource URI constructors. No code performs network calls, file operations, dynamic code execution, or any suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports indicate any malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are low, consistent with benign SDK schema definitions.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of active malicious behavior but considering the supply chain context, a slightly higher but still low risk score (e.g., 0.1) is acceptable for all.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the supply chain context but no actual risk present)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a set of well-structured, schema-based artifact class definitions for Google Cloud resources in Kubeflow Pipelines. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and I would not recommend any significant changes.",
