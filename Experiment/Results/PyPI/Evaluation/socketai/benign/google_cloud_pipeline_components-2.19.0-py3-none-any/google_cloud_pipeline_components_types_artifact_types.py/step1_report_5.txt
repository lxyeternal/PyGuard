{
  "purpose": "Define various artifact classes related to Google Cloud Resources used in Kubeflow Pipelines, including models, datasets, metrics, and container models.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class methods for creating artifact instances, and metadata assignment within class methods.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed in a harmful way; no network connections, file writes, or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to class methods are assigned to metadata or class attributes without dangerous transformations or executions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data schema and factory methods for artifact objects, relying on standard data structures and string formatting. There are no input/output operations, network connections, or command executions that could be malicious. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data classes with schema validation, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of schema definitions and artifact factory methods with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a typical implementation for defining cloud resource artifacts for Kubeflow Pipelines. The code appears safe and non-malicious.",
