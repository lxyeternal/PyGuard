{
  "purpose": "The code defines schema classes and factory methods for Google Cloud Vertex AI and BigQuery resource artifacts, as well as evaluation metrics, intended for use in Kubeflow Pipelines components.",
  "sources": "Static schema strings, class parameters, resource identifiers, method input arguments, and internal metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network calls, or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "Data from method parameters flows into artifact instances and associated metadata fields.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with static schemas and straightforward factory methods for creating resource artifact instances. There are no external calls, no dynamic code, and no data leaks. The purpose is to model resource metadata for Google Cloud services, which is standard SDK-like code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-built for resource schema definitions and artifact creation in Kubeflow Pipelines. It shows no malicious intent or security risks.",
