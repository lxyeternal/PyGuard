  "purpose": "Define various Google Cloud and Vertex AI artifact classes for use in Kubeflow Pipelines, enabling structured data handling and evaluation metrics reporting.",
  "sources": "Reading class definitions, method parameters, import statements, and constant string values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Create methods generate artifact instances with metadata; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of static resource URLs and schema definitions is standard for SDK artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for artifacts, schema declarations, and factory methods to instantiate these artifacts. No external data inputs or network calls are present. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations identified. The code appears to be a typical SDK artifact definition module, with schema validation and creation helpers. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The static URLs and schema definitions are expected in such SDK classes. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK artifact definition module for Google Cloud Vertex AI resources in Kubeflow Pipelines. No malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The code's purpose is to facilitate artifact handling, not to perform any harmful actions.",
