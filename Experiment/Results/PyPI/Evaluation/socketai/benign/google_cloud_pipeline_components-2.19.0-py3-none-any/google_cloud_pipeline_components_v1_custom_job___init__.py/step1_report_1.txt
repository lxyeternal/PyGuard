{
  "purpose": "To facilitate running Kubeflow Pipelines components as Vertex AI Custom Training Jobs with customized configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google_cloud_pipeline_components.v1.custom_job and __all__ declaration",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sink or potential data leak points in the code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code primarily imports and exposes modules",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected; imports are from reputable Google Cloud libraries",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific components related to Google Cloud's pipeline components for custom training jobs. It exposes these via __all__ for external use. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code's structure is minimal and conventional, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module setup for Google Cloud Pipeline Components related to custom training jobs. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions as a simple import and export of selected components.",
