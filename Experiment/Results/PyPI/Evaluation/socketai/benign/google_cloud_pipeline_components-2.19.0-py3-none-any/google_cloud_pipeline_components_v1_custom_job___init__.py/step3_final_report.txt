{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific components related to Google Cloud Vertex AI custom training jobs and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads licensing comments and imports from the google_cloud_pipeline_components.v1.custom_job package.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external outputs; the code only imports and exposes components.",
  "flows": "The code imports components and makes them available for other modules; no runtime data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific Google Cloud pipeline components and exposes them via __all__. It contains only static import statements and licensing comments, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity. The imported modules are from reputable sources, and the code functions solely as a setup or configuration module. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate and justified. It functions as a standard import/export module for Google Cloud Vertex AI pipeline components.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
