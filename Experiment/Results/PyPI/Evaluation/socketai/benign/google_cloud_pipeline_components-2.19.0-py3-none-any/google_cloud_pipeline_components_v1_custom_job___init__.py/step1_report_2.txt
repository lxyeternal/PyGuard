  "purpose": "To provide a module that facilitates running Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) components as Vertex AI Custom Training Jobs with custom configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from google_cloud_pipeline_components.v1.custom_job for custom training job components and utility functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and exposes certain components/functions for external use without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific components and utilities from a well-known Google Cloud SDK package for cloud training jobs. It defines an export list (__all__) to expose these components. No data input handling, user interaction, or network communication is present. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage. The code is straightforward, adhering to standard practices for module imports and exports, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module intended for use within a larger machine learning pipeline. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
