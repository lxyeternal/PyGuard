{
  "purpose": "To import and expose components for running Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP) as Vertex AI Custom Training Jobs with specific configurations.",
  "sources": "None of the sources read input directly; they import existing modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only imports and exposes functions/classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, or credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific components from a Google Cloud SDK module related to custom training jobs. It defines an __all__ list for exporting these components. The code is minimal, primarily for modular import/export purposes. It contains no logic that could be malicious or suspicious, such as network calls, command execution, or data handling that could leak information.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module import/export file used to structure code for Kubeflow and Vertex AI integration. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
