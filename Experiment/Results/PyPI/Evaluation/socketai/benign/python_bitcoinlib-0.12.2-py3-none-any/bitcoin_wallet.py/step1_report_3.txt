{
  "purpose": "The code provides wallet-related functionality for Bitcoin addresses and keys, including encoding/decoding addresses, script handling, and key management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include address strings, scriptPubKey objects, redeem scripts, and secret key bytes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are address creation, script generation, and key signing functions which could handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings or script objects through address parsing and script conversion functions to address or script output, or signing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Usage of exception handling for address parsing is standard. No suspicious network activity, system calls, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Bitcoin wallet functions such as address parsing (Bech32 and base58), scriptPubKey conversions, and key management, with exception handling for invalid formats. It validates address types, converts scripts to addresses, and signs hashes with private keys. The functions follow typical patterns for cryptocurrency wallet code. There are no indications of malicious logic, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does handle untrusted inputs but in a standard, expected manner for wallet operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard Bitcoin wallet utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to typical address and key management practices without any suspicious or malicious routines.",
