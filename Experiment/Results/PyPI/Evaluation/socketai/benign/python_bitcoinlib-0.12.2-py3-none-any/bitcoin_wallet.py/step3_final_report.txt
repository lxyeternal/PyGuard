{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for handling Bitcoin addresses, script conversions, and key management, including address parsing, scriptPubKey conversions, and signing operations.",
  "sources": "Input address strings, scriptPubKey byte sequences, secret key bytes, and public key bytes.",
  "sinks": "Address object creation, scriptPubKey generation, signing functions, and key derivation.",
  "flows": "Input data (addresses, scripts, keys) flows through parsing and validation routines into address objects or cryptographic operations such as signing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of assertions for validation is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Bitcoin address and key management functions relying on external cryptographic libraries. It performs address parsing, script conversions, and signing with appropriate error handling. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions and classes follow typical patterns for such utilities, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The error handling and validation routines are appropriate, and the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Bitcoin wallet utility module with no malicious intent or security concerns. It correctly handles various address formats, script conversions, and key operations without suspicious features. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero.",
