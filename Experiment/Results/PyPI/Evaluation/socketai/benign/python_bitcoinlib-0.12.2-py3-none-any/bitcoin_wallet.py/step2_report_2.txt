  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes address parsing, conversion, key management. Data flows from input strings/scripts to address objects, with no network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors, no malicious behaviors. Uses external libraries for cryptography and script handling. Error handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign code for Bitcoin wallet operations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The logic is sound, and no malicious activity is evident. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to report 1, standard wallet functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Standard handling of addresses, scripts, keys.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent and benign. The risk score is very low, reflecting standard operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard address parsing, script conversion, key management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no network activity, no backdoors. Handles untrusted inputs securely.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, non-malicious wallet utility functions.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Address handling, script conversions, key management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious routines. Uses assertions for validation, which is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar address and key handling functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is standard for a Bitcoin wallet library.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports find obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the inherent risk in handling untrusted data, but nothing malicious or dangerous.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of Bitcoin address and key management functions. No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network or data exfiltration routines are present. The minor risk score accounts for the handling of untrusted inputs, which is standard in such libraries.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided code and reports collectively indicate a benign, standard wallet utility module with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
