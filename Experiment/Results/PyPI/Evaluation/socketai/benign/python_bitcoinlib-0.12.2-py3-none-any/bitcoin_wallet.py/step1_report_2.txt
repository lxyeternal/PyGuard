{
  "purpose": "Provides wallet-related functionality for Bitcoin addresses and keys, including encoding, decoding, and address creation from scripts and keys.",
  "sources": "Import statements for bitcoin libraries, class methods for parsing addresses and scriptPubKeys, functions converting scripts to addresses, and key generation methods.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that produce addresses or scriptPubKeys, key signing methods, and address validation routines.",
  "flows": "Input data (addresses, scriptPubKeys, pubkeys) flows into parsing and validation functions, which produce address objects or scripts; key data flows into signing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks; code appears standard for a Bitcoin wallet library. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Bitcoin wallet address and key management features, including handling different address formats (Bech32, base58), creating addresses from scriptPubKeys, and signing data. It contains robust error handling for invalid formats. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is evident. The functions and class structures align with typical cryptocurrency wallet operations, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Bitcoin address and key management functions with no malicious intent detected. It is a legitimate library component, and no security risks or malware are apparent.",
