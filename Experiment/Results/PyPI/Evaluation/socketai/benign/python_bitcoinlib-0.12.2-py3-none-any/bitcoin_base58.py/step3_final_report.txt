{
  "purpose": "This code implements Base58 encoding and decoding with checksum validation, primarily used for Bitcoin address handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input bytes for encoding; reads Base58 string for decoding; uses bitcoin.core.Hash for checksum validation.",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded strings or decoded bytes; raises exceptions on invalid data or checksum mismatch.",
  "flows": "Bytes are converted to integer for encoding; Base58 string is converted back to bytes with checksum verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; standard implementation relying on bitcoin.core.Hash.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Base58 encoding/decoding with checksum validation, with proper error handling. It relies on bitcoin.core.Hash, which is typical in Bitcoin libraries. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are consistent with its functionality and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for Bitcoin data handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to dependency on external cryptographic functions, and the malware score is correctly set to 0.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
