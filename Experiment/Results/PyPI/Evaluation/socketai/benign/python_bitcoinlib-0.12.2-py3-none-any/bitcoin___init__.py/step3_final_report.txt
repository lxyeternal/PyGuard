{
  "purpose": "Defines and manages network parameters for different Bitcoin network environments, allowing selection among mainnet, testnet, regtest, and signet configurations.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes and the 'name' parameter in SelectParams() function, which determines the active network configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; the code only sets internal global variables based on validated input.",
  "flows": "The 'name' parameter flows into SelectParams(), which updates the global 'params' and 'bitcoin.core.coreparams' to the corresponding class instance.",
  "anomalies": "The 'DNS_SEEDS' in SigNetParams is assigned as a tuple with a single string, which may cause runtime issues; otherwise, no anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration module defining network parameters for Bitcoin networks via static classes and a selection function. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, secrets, or obfuscation. The 'SelectParams()' function validates input before setting global variables, minimizing risk. The DNS seeds are standard hostnames, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration module for Bitcoin network parameters. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all zero, consistent with its purpose.",
