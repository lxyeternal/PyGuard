{
  "purpose": "Defines chain parameters for different Bitcoin network configurations (mainnet, testnet, signet, regtest) and allows selection of network settings.",
  "sources": "Import of bitcoin.core module; usage of hardcoded chain parameters; global variables for chain parameter settings; function SelectParams for setting network parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs; parameter selection impacts the network configuration used by other components.",
  "flows": "User calls SelectParams with network name → sets global params and bitcoin.core.coreparams to corresponding network parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The DNS seeds and ports are standard for Bitcoin networks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines configuration classes for different Bitcoin network parameters, such as ports, DNS seeds, address prefixes, and human-readable parts for Bech32 addresses. The SelectParams function dynamically assigns these configurations based on input. All data appears to be standard and related to network configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of global variables is typical for configuration management in such modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks beyond the expected network setup parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module for Bitcoin network parameters with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply allows selecting between different predefined network settings for a Bitcoin client.",
