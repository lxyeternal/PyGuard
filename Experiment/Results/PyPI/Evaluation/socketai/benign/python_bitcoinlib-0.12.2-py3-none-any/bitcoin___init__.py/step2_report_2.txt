  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a configuration module defining network parameters for different Bitcoin networks.\n- It imports `bitcoin.core`, sets a version string, and defines classes with static attributes for network parameters.\n- The `SelectParams()` function switches global parameters based on user input, with validation.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, secrets, or external data handling.\n- DNS seeds and ports are standard and publicly known.\n- No data sinks, external inputs (besides the 'name' parameter), or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is straightforward, and no malicious or suspicious code is evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **Minor note:** In `SigNetParams`, the `DNS_SEEDS` is assigned as a tuple with a single string, which might be a typo. It should probably be a tuple of tuples or a list, e.g.,  \n  ```python\n  DNS_SEEDS = ((\"signet.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl\", \"seed.signet.bitcoin.sprovoost.nl\"),)\n  ```  \n  as currently, it's a tuple with a single string, which is inconsistent with other definitions.  \n  **However, this is a configuration detail, not a security flaw.**  \n  No security implications here.\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  All assign 0 or 0.5, with the highest being 0.9 in one report, but that seems overestimated.  \n  **In the third report, a 1 is assigned, but the analysis indicates no malicious intent.**  \n  I agree with a low risk score (e.g., 0) because this is purely configuration code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of the Reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is configuration-only, with no malicious behavior.\n- The slight variation in confidence (0.9 vs. 1) is acceptable, but given the straightforward nature, I would rate confidence at 1 for all.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or payloads.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk:** 0 — purely configuration, no external data, no dynamic code execution, no secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a standard configuration module for Bitcoin network parameters.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores in the reports are appropriate, perhaps slightly conservative in some cases.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and structure.",
