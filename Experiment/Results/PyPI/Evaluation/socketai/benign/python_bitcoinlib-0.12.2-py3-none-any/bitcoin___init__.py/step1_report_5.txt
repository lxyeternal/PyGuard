{
  "purpose": "Define network parameters for different Bitcoin blockchain environments (mainnet, testnet, signet, regtest) for the python-bitcoinlib library.",
  "sources": "Imports bitcoin.core module, reads __version__ variable, class attribute definitions, DNS seed tuples, function parameter 'name'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no external data outputs or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; parameter selection occurs within SelectParams function, which sets global configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or hidden operations. The code appears straightforward, configuring network parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code defines network parameter classes for various Bitcoin network environments, including mainnet, testnet, signet, and regtest. Each class specifies network identifiers, port numbers, DNS seeds, and address prefixes. The global variable 'params' is initialized to MainParams and can be altered by the SelectParams function, which updates the parameters based on input string. No external inputs, cryptographic secrets, or potentially malicious code constructs are present. The code is purely configuration-oriented, with no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a configuration module for network parameters in a Bitcoin library. It contains no malicious or suspicious code and serves a purely legitimate purpose. The structure and content are consistent with standard configuration patterns, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
