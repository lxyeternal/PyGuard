  "purpose": "Define and select Bitcoin network parameters for different chain types (mainnet, testnet, signet, regtest) used by the bitcoin-lib.",
  "sources": "Importing bitcoin.core and reading the __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Initialization of network parameters, selection of chain parameters based on user input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. DNS seed data is publicly known, no dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a core bitcoin library and defines multiple classes specifying network parameters for different Bitcoin networks. It includes DNS seed hostnames, port configurations, address prefixes, and human-readable parts for Bech32 addresses. The parameters are selected via the 'SelectParams' function, which modifies global state. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources; the code simply sets network configurations. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely manages network parameters for bitcoin-lib with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations or data handling beyond configuration. The code appears safe and typical for a blockchain network parameter setup.",
