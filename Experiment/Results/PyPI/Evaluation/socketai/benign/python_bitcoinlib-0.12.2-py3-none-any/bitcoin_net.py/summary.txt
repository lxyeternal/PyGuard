  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of Bitcoin protocol message classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero."
