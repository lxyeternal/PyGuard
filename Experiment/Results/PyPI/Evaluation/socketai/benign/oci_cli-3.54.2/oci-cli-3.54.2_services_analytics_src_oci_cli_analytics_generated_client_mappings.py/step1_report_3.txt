{
  "purpose": "The code initializes imports and client configurations for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) SDK modules related to analytics.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'oci', 'oci_cli.cli_clients', and 'oci.analytics'. It also reads configuration from the 'CLIENT_MAP' and 'MODULE_TO_TYPE_MAPPINGS' dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Assignment operations modifying 'MODULE_TO_TYPE_MAPPINGS' and 'CLIENT_MAP'. No data sinks, external network calls, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import data flows into variables and modules, then updates the global dictionaries for client configuration. No untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be auto-generated configuration code for SDK initialization. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up SDK modules for OCI analytics services, importing necessary libraries and configuring client mappings. It explicitly states it is auto-generated by OracleSDKGenerator, which suggests standard, legitimate SDK setup code. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration activities. The use of 'import' and assignment statements are standard for SDK configuration. No external network connections or sensitive data handling are present that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward SDK setup script for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is likely part of a larger, legitimate application framework.",
