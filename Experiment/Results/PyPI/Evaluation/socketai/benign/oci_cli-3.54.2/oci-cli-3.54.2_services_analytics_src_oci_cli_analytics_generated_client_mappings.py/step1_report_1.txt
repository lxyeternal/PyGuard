{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures client mappings for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK components, specifically for the analytics service.",
  "sources": "Imports the oci module and its submodules, and sets up CLIENT_MAP and MODULE_TO_TYPE_MAPPINGS dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Assigning the AnalyticsClient instance to CLIENT_MAP, which could be used elsewhere for API interactions.",
  "flows": "Imports oci -> modifies MODULE_TO_TYPE_MAPPINGS and CLIENT_MAP -> instantiates AnalyticsClient and assigns it to CLIENT_MAP.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is primarily configuration and setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK setup script, importing necessary modules, updating mappings, and initializing a client instance. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, data processing, or network operations that could be malicious. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup script for Oracle's OCI SDK. It configures client mappings for the analytics service without any signs of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or security issues.",
