  "purpose": "This code initializes client mappings and registers an AnalyticsClient for the OCI SDK, serving as setup/configuration code.",
  "sources": "Import statements and module attribute assignments, reading static module data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Import and assignment operations without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated SDK setup code that imports modules, updates mappings, and registers a client. It contains no user input, external data, network activity, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign configuration routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK initialization snippet with no malicious or security issues. It poses minimal security risk and is free from obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
