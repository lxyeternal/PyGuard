{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and registers an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Analytics client for use in a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements for OCI SDK modules, setting up client mappings and type mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only sets up imports and client registration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code performs static configuration and initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is standard SDK setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing comments, imports OCI SDK modules, updates a mapping for 'analytics' models, and registers an AnalyticsClient in a client map. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are processed. The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for SDK client setup, with no evidence of malicious behavior or suspicious code. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious activities apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK client setup snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures the OCI SDK for analytics service usage.",
