  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) SDK module for analytics, setting up client mappings and type mappings.",
  "sources": "Imports oci library, oci_cli module for client mappings, and OCI analytics client.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data flow to external systems, no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Import statements set up modules and mappings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; code is auto-generated, standard SDK initialization.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard SDK setup for OCI analytics services. It imports necessary modules, configures a client map if not already present, and assigns the AnalyticsClient class to a specific key. The comments and licensing information are standard for auto-generated SDK code. No user input, environment variables, or external data handling is observed. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate OCI SDK usage and configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard SDK setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is auto-generated for SDK configuration purposes and appears safe.",
