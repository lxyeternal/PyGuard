  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippets are solely license and copyright comments.\n- There are no executable statements, data flows, or untrusted input handling in any of the snippets.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports consistently conclude that these snippets are benign, with no security risk or malware.\n- The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The securityRisk scores are all 0, which is reasonable.\n- The reasoning is sound: license headers are harmless.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- Since the code snippets are purely comments, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores based on the provided information.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code snippets pose no security threat.\n- The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are correct. The code snippets are benign licensing headers with no security implications. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
