  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe only licensing and copyright comments with no executable code, data input/output, or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the snippets are benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which seems appropriate given the nature of the snippets.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the absence of any obfuscation or suspicious code segments.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- Since the code snippets are only license headers, there is no scope for runtime vulnerabilities, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound; they correctly identify that no executable or data handling code is present.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities based solely on comments, which is correct.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The overall malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the absence of executable code or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the nature of the code snippets. They correctly identify that these license headers pose no security or malware risks. No further action or score adjustments are needed.",
