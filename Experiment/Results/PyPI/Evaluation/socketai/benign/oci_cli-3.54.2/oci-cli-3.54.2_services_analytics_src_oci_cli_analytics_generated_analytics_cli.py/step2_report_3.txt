  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Reports 1, 2, 3, 5:**  \n   All indicate \"Empty response\" with no additional details.  \n   - These do not provide any content to evaluate.  \n   - They could be artifacts or incomplete reports, but since they contain no information, we cannot assess issues or risks from them.\n\n2. **Report 4:**  \n   - **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines CLI commands for OCI Analytics resource management, with inputs from CLI parameters, JSON, and user prompts.  \n   - **Sinks:** API calls to OCI SDK, with no suspicious or malicious sinks.  \n   - **Flows:** Standard pattern: parameter processing → API invocation → response handling → optional wait logic.  \n   - **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no use of eval/exec, no dynamic imports, no hidden network activity. User prompts are typical for CLI tools to prevent accidental destructive actions.  \n   - **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a typical auto-generated CLI interface for OCI SDK operations, with standard safety and validation. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward, with proper error handling and wait mechanisms for long-running operations.  \n   - **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)  \n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)  \n   - **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)  \n   - **Security Risk:** 0 (no security issues identified)\n\n**Assessment Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated CLI wrapper around OCI SDK calls for managing Analytics instances and related resources.  \n- There are no signs of malicious code, sabotage, or obfuscation.  \n- The wait logic, user prompts, and parameter validation are consistent with safe CLI practices.  \n- The \"Empty response\" reports do not provide any evidence of issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be **0**.  \n- The high confidence and lack of malicious indicators support this conclusion.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                                        |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious activity detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is straightforward, auto-generated CLI code, no obfuscation.  |\n| Risk           | 0                 | No security risks or malicious behavior identified.                |\n\nThis assessment indicates the code is safe and performs legitimate resource management functions within OCI.",
