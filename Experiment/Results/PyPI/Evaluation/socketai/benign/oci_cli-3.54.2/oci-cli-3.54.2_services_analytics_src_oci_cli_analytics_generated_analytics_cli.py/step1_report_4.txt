{
  "purpose": "This code defines CLI commands for managing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Analytics instances, including creation, updates, deletion, and configuration of related resources like private access channels, vanity URLs, and network endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input data from CLI options (parameters), including resource identifiers, JSON parameters for complex objects, and user confirmations. External data might come from user input, environment variables, or headers in HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "API calls to OCI services via SDK clients; waits on work requests using get_work_request, which retrieves status and progress. No direct data leaks or untrusted sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "User inputs CLI parameters -> CLI command functions process parameters -> build API request details -> invoke OCI SDK client methods -> receive responses -> optionally wait for work request completion -> render output or handle errors.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated CLI command definitions with extensive options. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Use of standard OCI SDK calls, user confirmation prompts for destructive or critical updates, and standard wait logic for long-running operations. No hidden network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script defines numerous CLI commands with parameter validation, JSON input parsing, and standard OCI SDK client calls for resource management. It uses consistent patterns for handling long-running operations via work requests, including waiting for specific states. User prompts prevent accidental destructive actions. No suspicious code structures, such as eval, exec, or dynamic imports, are present. The code adheres to standard SDK usage and CLI patterns, indicating normal, intended functionality. The only potential concern is user confirmation prompts for certain updates, which is typical for CLI tools, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI command implementation for OCI Analytics resource management. It does not contain malicious code or sabotage indicators. It performs legitimate operations such as resource creation, updates, deletion, and status polling. No malicious activity, backdoors, data theft, or malicious network activity is detected.",
