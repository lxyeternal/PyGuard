  "flows": "No data flows; only metadata comments",
  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments and auto-generation note, no suspicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of comments specifying licensing terms, copyright notices, and an auto-generation disclaimer. There is no executable code, no data input/output, or other suspicious elements. The comments do not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions. This is typical boilerplate for SDK files and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as licensing and metadata information with no malicious intent. It contains no executable logic or data handling that could pose security risks.",
