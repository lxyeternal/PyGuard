  "flows": "No data flows; only static comments with no executable code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of comments with licensing and auto-generation notices. There are no executable statements, data input points, or sinks. The comments are standard boilerplate, and no malicious or suspicious features are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the content. The analysis confirms that the code is purely metadata, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of licensing comments with no executable or malicious content. The current scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the content. No further action or concern is necessary.",
