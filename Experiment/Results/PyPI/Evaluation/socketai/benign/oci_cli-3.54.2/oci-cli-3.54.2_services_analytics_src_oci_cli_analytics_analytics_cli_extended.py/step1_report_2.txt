  "purpose": "The code provides CLI commands for managing Oracle Analytics instances, including creating and updating instances and vanity URLs, with options to read sensitive data from files.",
  "sources": "File inputs for access tokens, private keys, certificates; CLI options for parameters; JSON input for complex types.",
  "sinks": "Concatenation and reading of token files into strings, usage of content in API calls; potential exposure if files contain secrets or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "File content is read into strings and assigned to parameters, which are then used in API calls; tokens and certificates are loaded from files, then passed to underlying service commands.",
  "anomalies": "Handling of secret files involves reading entire file content into memory, but no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The code does not perform network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears straightforward and focused on parameter processing.",
  "analysis": "The script extends and customizes existing CLI commands, particularly for handling sensitive data (tokens, keys, certificates) via file inputs. It reads content from specified files and injects this data into parameters for downstream API calls. The process is standard for CLI tools handling secrets, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The removal of certain commands and renaming actions are administrative adjustments, not malicious activities. Overall, the code is primarily concerned with parameter handling and command configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI extension for managing Oracle Analytics instances, with secure handling of sensitive files. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage evident. It processes secrets securely by reading files into memory and passing their contents to API calls. No security risks or malware detected based on the provided code.",
