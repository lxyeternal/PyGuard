  "purpose": "This code provides CLI command extensions for creating and updating Oracle Analytics instances and vanity URLs, incorporating custom file input handling for sensitive data such as tokens and certificates.",
  "sources": "File inputs for '--idcs-access-token-file', '--private-key-file', '--public-certificate-file', '--ca-certificate-file'; reading contents of files containing tokens and certificates.",
  "sinks": "Content of token files and certificate files are assigned to parameters, which could be used in API calls or network communications. No direct data leaks or insecure use detected.",
  "flows": "File contents are read and assigned to parameters used in API calls for creating or updating resources. Sensitive data from files flows into parameters used for authentication and TLS setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors or obfuscated code present. File reading is straightforward, with no suspicious handling. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily extends CLI commands to handle file inputs for sensitive credentials and certificates, converting file content into string parameters for downstream API calls. It carefully removes temporary file parameters after reading contents. No malicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation observed. The code follows standard practices for handling sensitive data via file input and parameter substitution. All file operations are simple reads; no dynamic execution or suspicious flow detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate extension of CLI commands for Oracle Analytics resource management. It handles sensitive data securely via file inputs without embedding secrets directly into code. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indications are present.",
