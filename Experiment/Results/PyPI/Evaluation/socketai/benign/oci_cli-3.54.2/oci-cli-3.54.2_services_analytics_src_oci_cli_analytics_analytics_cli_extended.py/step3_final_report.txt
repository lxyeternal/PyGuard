{
  "purpose": "The code customizes CLI commands for OCI Analytics services, handling secret files and parameters for creating and updating instances and vanity URLs.",
  "sources": "File inputs for IDCS access tokens, certificates, private keys, and other sensitive parameters read via click.File and injected into command parameters.",
  "sinks": "Content of secret files is read into variables and passed directly into API request parameters without validation or sanitization.",
  "flows": "File content is read into variables (e.g., 'idcs_access_token', 'private_key', 'public_certificate', 'ca_certificate') and then injected into request payloads for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. The code straightforwardly reads files and injects their contents.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive data from files and passes them into API parameters, which is standard for CLI tools. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The handling of secrets could pose security risks if files are compromised, but this is typical in such contexts. The code does not perform validation or sanitization, which could be a concern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI extension for OCI services, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is proper management of secret files outside the code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical secret handling concerns but no active threats.",
