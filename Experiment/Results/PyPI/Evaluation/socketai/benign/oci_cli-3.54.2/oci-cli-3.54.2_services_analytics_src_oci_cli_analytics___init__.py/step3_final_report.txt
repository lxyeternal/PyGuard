  "purpose": "The code contains only licensing, copyright, and auto-generation comments with no executable logic or data flows.",
  "sources": "Comments in the code, specifically licensing and auto-generation notices.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or malicious actions possible.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow exists beyond static comments; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is purely comments with standard boilerplate notices.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are solely comments related to licensing and auto-generation notices, with no executable code, data processing, or data input/output. The absence of code logic, data flows, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the clear and standard nature of the comments. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, containing only licensing and auto-generation comments. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessment and scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
