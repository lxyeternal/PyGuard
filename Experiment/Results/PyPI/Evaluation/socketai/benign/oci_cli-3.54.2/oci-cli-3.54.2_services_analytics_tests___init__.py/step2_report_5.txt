  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code snippet is solely a header comment containing licensing, copyright, and auto-generation notices.  \n- There are no executable statements, data processing, input/output functions, or code logic present.  \n- No sources, sinks, or data flows are identified beyond comments.  \n- The code is standard boilerplate for SDK files, which is common practice and not suspicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Obfuscated Content**:  \n- All reports agree that there are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.  \n- The code is purely informational and contains no embedded code that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no functional or security concerns.  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.  \n- The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the lack of obfuscation.  \n- The security risk scores are zero, appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:  \n- The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about hidden malicious code, given the content.  \n- They appropriately focus on the visible code and licensing comments.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations**:  \n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.  \n- Since the code is purely boilerplate, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk score**: **0** — no security risk associated with licensing comments.\n\n**Additional note**: Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate. If future code snippets contain actual logic, data handling, or executable statements, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the current scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.",
