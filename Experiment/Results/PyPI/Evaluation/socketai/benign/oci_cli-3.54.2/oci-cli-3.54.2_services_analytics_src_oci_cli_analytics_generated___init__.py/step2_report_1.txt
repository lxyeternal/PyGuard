  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on comments and licensing headers.\n- No executable code, data input/output, or data flows are present.\n- The code snippets are standard auto-generated SDK headers with licensing info.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the comments.\n- Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that these are non-executable comments, with no data flows or sinks.\n- There are no anomalies or suspicious elements beyond typical SDK header comments.\n- The reasoning that these snippets are benign and pose no security risk is sound.\n\n**Potential Issues or Adjustments:**\n- Since the code is only comments, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n- Given the nature of the code, I agree with all the provided scores and assessments.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, auto-generated SDK header comment block with no security concerns.",
