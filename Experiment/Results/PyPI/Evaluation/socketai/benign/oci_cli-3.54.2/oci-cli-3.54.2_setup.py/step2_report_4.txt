  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script; reads version, README, dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks; environment variable influences file reading but only reads static content.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script performs typical package setup; environment variable handling is standard. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup tasks; reads version, README, and conditionally reads a template file based on an environment variable.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variable influences reading 'oci_template.py'; no network or code injection.\n- **Anomalies:** Slightly unusual use of environment variable to modify setup, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup with minor dynamic behavior; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup; reads version, README, environment variable influences setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variable affects reading a file; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of environment variable for configuration is common.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate package setup; no malware or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup tasks; environment variable influences reading a template.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity; environment variable modifies setup behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; environment-driven configuration is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup; environment variable affects reading a template file.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or code injection; configuration based on environment variable.\n- **Anomalies:** Slightly unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard setup script with conditional configuration based on environment variables, which is common.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code performs typical package setup functions with only environment-based configuration.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to environment variable handling, which is standard.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
