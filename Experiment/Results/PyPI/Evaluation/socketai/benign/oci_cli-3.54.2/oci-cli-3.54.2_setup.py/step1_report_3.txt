  "purpose": "Setup script for the oci-cli package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a file, environment variable OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE, and package directories.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE to potentially modify package setup behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variable OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE influences package setup by reading a file path and modifying script templates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE to conditionally load and modify code; no direct malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. Dynamic package discovery appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info, reading files, defining dependencies, and discovering packages. It conditionally reads a file specified by an environment variable to modify the behavior of the setup, which is a common pattern for configurable setups. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities are observed. No code injection, data leaks, or malware indicators are present. The environment variable usage is for configuration purposes, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package with conditional configuration based on environment variables. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware, only standard package setup routines. No security risks are evident.",
