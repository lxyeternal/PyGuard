  "purpose": "Setup script for the OCI CLI package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'src/oci_cli/version.py', reads README content, reads 'src/oci_cli/oci_template.py' if OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE environment variable is set, reads environment variable OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'setup()' function with populated parameters, reading files, accessing environment variable.",
  "flows": "Reading version and README files, conditionally reading 'oci_template.py' based on environment variable, passing collected data to setup(), no untrusted data flow to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional reading of 'oci_template.py' based on environment variable; no code injection or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures. The code mainly deals with package configuration and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading version info via regex, reading README, defining dependencies, including optional extras, dynamically discovering packages, and configuring setup parameters. The only potentially unusual aspect is the conditional reading of 'oci_template.py' based on an environment variable, which appears to be a normal configuration practice. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior. The code relies on standard Python modules and setuptools functions, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. The purpose is legitimate package setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup.py file used for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. Its operations are standard for package distribution, with no suspicious flows or anomalies detected.",
