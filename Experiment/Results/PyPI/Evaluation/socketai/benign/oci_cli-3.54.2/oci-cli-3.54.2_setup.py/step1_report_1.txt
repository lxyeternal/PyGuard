  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the OCI CLI Python package, including dependency management and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Environment variable OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE, reading files 'version.py' and 'README.rst', and package discovery functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified that lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE influences code execution in conditional block, but only imports a module and reads a static file content; no data flow to external systems or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The only dynamic aspect is conditional file reading based on an environment variable, which is standard behavior. The code does not execute untrusted code or make network connections.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package: reading version info, reading README, specifying dependencies, discovering packages, and configuring setup parameters. It conditionally reads a file based on an environment variable, which is common for configurable build options. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The overall structure adheres to typical setup.py practices without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only notable aspect is the conditional handling of an environment variable for FIPS compliance, which is legitimate and non-malicious.",
