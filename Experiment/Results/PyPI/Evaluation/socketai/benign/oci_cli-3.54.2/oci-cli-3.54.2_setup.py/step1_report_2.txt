  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the OCI CLI Python project, including dependency management and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE', reading 'src/oci_cli/version.py', reading 'README.rst', and reading 'src/oci_cli/oci_template.py' if the environment variable is set.",
  "sinks": "Reading files from the filesystem, importing environment variables, and setting up package configurations. No direct data sinks or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE' influences reading of 'oci_template.py'. File reading flows are used to extract version and long description, and potentially to modify setup behavior based on environment variable.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'ScriptWriter.template' based on an environment variable 'OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE' is unusual; it alters the 'setuptools' command behavior. No code injection or suspicious code execution is observed. The rest of the code is standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading version info from a specific source file using regex, reading README content, defining dependencies, and configuring package discovery. It dynamically extends package lists based on directory structure, which is typical for large multi-package projects. The environment variable check influences the setup process by reading and applying a template to a 'ScriptWriter' object, which is a less common but not inherently malicious pattern. No use of untrusted data in a dangerous context, no network activity, no obfuscated or malicious code is present. The overall logic appears legitimate and consistent with normal Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor, unusual conditional based on an environment variable that influences package setup behavior. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The use of environment variables to modify setup behavior is not suspicious in itself. Overall, the script appears safe and legitimate.",
