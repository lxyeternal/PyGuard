{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script manages the packaging and installation of the oci-cli Python project, defining dependencies, package data, and configuration based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'version.py', reads README, and conditionally reads 'oci_template.py' based on the environment variable 'OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the environment variable influences reading a file and setting a class attribute, but does not execute code or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'OCI_CLI_FIPS_LIBCRYPTO_FILE' influences reading 'oci_template.py' and assigning it to 'ScriptWriter.template'.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional reading of a template file based on an environment variable is unusual but standard for configurable build scripts; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with environment-variable-based configuration. It reads version info, dependencies, and package data, and conditionally modifies a class attribute based on an environment variable. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The environment variable usage is typical for configuration purposes and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The environment variable handling is a common pattern for configurable build processes. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
