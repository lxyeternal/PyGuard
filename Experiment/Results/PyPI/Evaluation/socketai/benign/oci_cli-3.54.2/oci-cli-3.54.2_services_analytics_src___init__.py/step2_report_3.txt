  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are based solely on header comments containing licensing, copyright, and auto-generation notices.\n- No executable code, data input/output, or logic is present in any snippet.\n- No suspicious patterns, embedded scripts, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The reports correctly conclude that these snippets are benign, metadata comments with no security risks.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms no code present, only licensing comments.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Malware score: 0 — correct, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9).\n- Correctly notes the absence of executable code or suspicious patterns.\n- Security risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusions; purely informational comments.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- No security concerns or malware detected.\n- Scores: 0 for security risk and malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, only licensing comments, no executable logic.\n- Confirms no security issues.\n- Scores: 0 for both security risk and malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others; benign header comments.\n- High confidence (1).\n- No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the absence of executable code or suspicious content.\n- The confidence levels are justified based on the static, benign nature of the snippets.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0, since comments are straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as there is no security risk.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe provided snippets are benign header comments with no security implications. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the content.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity in the code snippets.",
