  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- *Purpose:* Header comment with licensing info.  \n- *Findings:* No executable code, data input/output, or data flow.  \n- *Assessment:* Completely benign; no malicious activity or security risk.  \n- *Scores:* Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- *Conclusion:* Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- *Purpose:* Licensing and auto-generation info.  \n- *Findings:* Only comments, no code or data processing.  \n- *Assessment:* No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.  \n- *Scores:* Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- *Conclusion:* Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- *Purpose:* Metadata and licensing info.  \n- *Findings:* Only comments, no executable code.  \n- *Assessment:* No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- *Scores:* Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- *Conclusion:* Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- *Purpose:* Licensing and auto-generation note.  \n- *Findings:* Only comments, no code.  \n- *Assessment:* No security concerns.  \n- *Scores:* Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- *Conclusion:* Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- *Purpose:* Header comment with licensing info.  \n- *Findings:* Only comments, no executable logic.  \n- *Assessment:* No malicious or suspicious activity.  \n- *Scores:* Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- *Conclusion:* Valid, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports are based on header comments and licensing notices only.\n- No executable code, data processing, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- Risk scores are correctly low, reflecting no security threat.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the consistent nature of these snippets, I agree with the assigned scores. The code snippets are purely informational, with no malicious or obfuscated content. Therefore, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is straightforward comments.\n- **Risk score:** 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n**Overall, these reports are accurate and appropriate.**",
