{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for error messages used in a Tencent-related software component, likely for handling various failure modes and parameter issues.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for error message constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the constants are static string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant string definitions representing error codes and messages. There is no input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger SDK or application that reports specific errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple set of error message constants. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
