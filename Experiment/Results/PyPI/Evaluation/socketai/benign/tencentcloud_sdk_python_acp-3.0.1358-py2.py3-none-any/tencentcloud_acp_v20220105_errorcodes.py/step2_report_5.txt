  "review": "Let's review the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of constant string definitions for error/status messages.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output handling, dynamic execution, or external interactions.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-structured, and includes licensing comments, indicating standard practice for defining constants.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Obfuscation**:\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are detected.\n   - The code is not obfuscated, and no signs of malware are present.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude benign intent.\n\n3. **Security Risks**:\n   - Since the code only defines constants, there is no apparent security risk.\n   - No data leaks, untrusted data processing, or external calls are involved.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Issues in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a simple constants file for error messages.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The confidence level should stay at **1** as the analysis is clear and definitive.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- No changes needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
