  "sinks": "No data input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static constants only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants representing error states, with licensing comments. No dynamic code, input handling, external interactions, or obfuscation are present. The code is typical for configuration or SDK constants and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
