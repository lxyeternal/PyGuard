{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define constants for error messages or status codes related to operation failures, parameter errors, and unsupported operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; constants are hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be exploited or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns string values to constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only basic constant definitions; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string constants representing error or status messages, likely for use in an API or software module. It is well-structured, includes licensing information, and does not include any code that processes input or performs any operations beyond simple variable assignments. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The content is straightforward and typical for configuration or localization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of constant definitions for error messages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
