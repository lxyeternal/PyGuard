{
  "purpose": "The code defines constant string variables representing various error or status messages, likely for use in a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values assigned to variables, with no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data leaks or sensitive data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-documented constants definition with licensing info; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments, constant variable definitions for error messages, and no functional or dynamic code elements. No input reading, data processing, or network activities are present. The structure is typical for configuration or error handling modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard constants definition file containing error message strings, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and typical for SDK or API response handling.",
