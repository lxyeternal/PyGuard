  "purpose": "This code appears to define constant string variables representing various error or status messages, likely for use in an SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments at the top of the file",
  "sinks": "No sink points involving untrusted data or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are static constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present; comments and license are standard",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string assignments for error messages, accompanied by licensing and comment headers. There are no input reading, no external data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase, possibly SDK or API definitions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This file is a straightforward definition of error message constants with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
