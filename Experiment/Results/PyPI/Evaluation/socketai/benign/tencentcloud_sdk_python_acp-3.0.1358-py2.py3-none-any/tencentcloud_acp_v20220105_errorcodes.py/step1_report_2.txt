{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for error or status messages related to operations, parameters, and unsupported actions.",
  "sources": "The code sources are hardcoded string assignments for error/status labels.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains simple constant definitions for error messages, with licensing comments at the top. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external interactions are present. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these constants are used for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It serves as a basic configuration or constants file.",
