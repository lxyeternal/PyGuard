  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided due to the absence of code content; however, it appears to be a placeholder or empty script with no clear functionality.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources or data inputs are present in the code, as it is empty or contains no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code does not perform any output, network communication, file writing, or other data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows because the code does not process or transfer any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty or consists solely of whitespace, with no apparent logic, variables, or data handling. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is either empty or contains no executable instructions, which means there are no code flows, data processing, or potential security concerns. Its structure and format are normal for an empty or placeholder script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of any code content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears benign but non-functional.",
