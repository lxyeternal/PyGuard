The highest suspicion arises from code with obfuscation and dynamic execution, but without concrete malicious actions, the likelihood remains low. Minor adjustments to obfuscation scores in some reports could better reflect the suspicion level. The current assessments are appropriate given the evidence, with no immediate threats identified."
