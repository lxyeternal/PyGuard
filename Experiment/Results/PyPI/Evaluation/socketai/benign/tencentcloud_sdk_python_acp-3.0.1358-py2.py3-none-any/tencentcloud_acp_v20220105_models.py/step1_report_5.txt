{
  "purpose": "Define data models for application privacy diagnosis tasks, application information, request/response structures, and resource usage info, primarily for API interactions within a Tencent cloud security context.",
  "sources": "Reading input parameters in '_deserialize' methods; accessing class properties; using 'params.get' to populate object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to class attributes; warnings about unused parameters; no direct data leaks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are deserialized into class instances; data flows from 'params' dictionaries into object attributes; no dangerous or untrusted data directly influence system actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of warnings for unused parameters appears standard. No obfuscation, suspicious function calls, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions with properties, getters, setters, and deserialization methods that assign values from input parameters to object attributes. The '_deserialize' methods perform straightforward data mapping with no dynamic code execution or external system interactions. No network operations, file I/O, or malicious behavior is present. The warnings about unused parameters are standard practice in SDKs to alert developers about extraneous data. All classes serve as data containers for API request/response structures. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard SDK/data model code used for API communication, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It merely structures data for API requests and responses, adhering to typical patterns without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
