{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version identifier for a software module, with licensing information and copyright statements.",
  "sources": "The only source is the hardcoded __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths are present, as the code only contains comments and a variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the only flow is setting a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive license comments, but no suspicious or unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of licensing comments, copyright notices, and a single variable assignment for __version__. There are no input/output operations, no code execution, no network activity, and no embedded scripts or obfuscated logic. The version string is static and hardcoded, which is common in open-source modules. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is minimal and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard header with licensing information and a version assignment. It poses no security risks or malicious intent based on its content.",
