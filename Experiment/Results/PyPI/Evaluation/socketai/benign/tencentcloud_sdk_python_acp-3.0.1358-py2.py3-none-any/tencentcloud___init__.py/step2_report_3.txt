  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature**:  \n   The provided code is a standard license header with comments, copyright notices, and a version string assignment (`__version__ = '3.0.1358'`).  \n   There is no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or code that could be malicious. It is typical boilerplate code used in open-source Python modules.\n\n2. **Source, Sink, and Flow Analysis**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that there are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The code is purely metadata.\n\n3. **Anomalies & Suspicious Behavior**:  \n   No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected. The comments and version assignment are standard and benign.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concern.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:  \n   The reports seem to assume that because the code is only comments and a version string, it cannot be malicious. This is a reasonable assumption, and no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n6. **Consistency & Justification**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk, as the code is purely metadata and licensing info)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the nature of the code, there is no reason to assign any higher scores. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on this fragment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a benign license header with version info.  \n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.  \n- The scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
