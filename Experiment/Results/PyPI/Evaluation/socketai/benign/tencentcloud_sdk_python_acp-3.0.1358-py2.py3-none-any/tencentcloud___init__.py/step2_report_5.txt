  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the code as a licensing header and version declaration, with no executable logic, data processing, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code consists solely of comments and a single variable assignment (`__version__ = '3.0.1358'`).\n- No sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware are detected.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), and all scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code is legitimate, standard in open-source projects, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The license comments are standard, and the version string is typical for software versioning.\n\n**Potential issues or logical flaws:**\n- None of the reports suggest any actual code behavior that could be malicious or risky.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate; the code fragment is benign.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are zero, consistent with the absence of any security concern.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- Since all reports uniformly conclude that this is a benign, metadata-only code fragment, I agree with their assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- There is no evidence in this code snippet to warrant any concern. It is a standard license header with version info, common in open-source projects.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
