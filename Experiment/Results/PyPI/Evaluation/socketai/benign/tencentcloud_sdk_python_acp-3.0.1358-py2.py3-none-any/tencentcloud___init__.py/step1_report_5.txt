{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and copyright header for a Python package, likely part of a larger project, with versioning information.",
  "sources": "The source is primarily the header comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only contains comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is purely a metadata header.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header with a version variable assignment. It contains no executable logic, no input/output handling, and no external data reading or writing. The comments specify licensing terms and copyright information. The only code line assigns a version string to __version__, which is common in Python packages for version tracking.",
  "conclusion": "There is no malicious behavior or security concern in this code snippet. It functions solely as metadata and licensing information for a larger package or project.",
