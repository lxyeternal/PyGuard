  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a license header and version identifier for an open-source Python project, containing no executable logic or suspicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to zero, reflecting the harmless nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and transparency of the code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header with a version identifier, posing no security threat or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no further action is necessary.",
