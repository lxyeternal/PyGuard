  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header comment section and version declaration, likely part of a larger Python module or package, used for licensing and version tracking.",
  "sources": "The license comments and version string (__version__ = '3.0.1358')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow in this fragment; it is purely metadata and comments",
  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments and version declaration with no functional code; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "This code contains only license information, comments, and a version variable assignment. There are no executable statements, data input sources, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalies are present. The version number suggests it's a release identifier. No data leaks or malicious logic detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, consisting solely of licensing comments and a version variable declaration. It does not contain any malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It is part of standard metadata in a Python package.",
