  "conclusion": "Based on the summaries, the assessments are justified and consistent. The absence of code and suspicious patterns supports assigning malware and obfuscated scores of 0.0. The security risk scores at 0.2 are slightly conservative; lowering them to 0.1 would better align with the evidence. Overall, the reports are accurate, and no significant revisions are necessary."
