  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'murmurhash' Python package, including version, author, license, and project URL.",
  "sources": "Module-level variable assignments for metadata (__title__, __version__, __summary__, __uri__, __author__, __email__, __license__).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data handling or untrusted input processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A - only static metadata assignments; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward metadata declarations with comments. No obfuscated or suspicious code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting package metadata, with comments referencing external sources. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no handling of external or untrusted data. The presence of comments and standard variable assignments pose no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to set package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this fragment.",
