  "purpose": "This code defines static package metadata variables for the 'murmurhash' Python package, including title, version, summary, URI, author, email, and license information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only from static string literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and typical for package info modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no functions, dynamic code, external data handling, or network operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
