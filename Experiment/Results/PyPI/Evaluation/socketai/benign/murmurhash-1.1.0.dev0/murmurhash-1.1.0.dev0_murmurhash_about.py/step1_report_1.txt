{
  "purpose": "This code defines metadata variables for the 'murmurhash' Python package, including version, title, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "The source is the code itself, which contains hardcoded metadata assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, I/O operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments providing package metadata. No input reading, no external data processing, no network calls, and no dynamic execution. It appears to be standard package metadata, commonly used in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to store package metadata. There are no security threats or malicious behaviors detected.",
