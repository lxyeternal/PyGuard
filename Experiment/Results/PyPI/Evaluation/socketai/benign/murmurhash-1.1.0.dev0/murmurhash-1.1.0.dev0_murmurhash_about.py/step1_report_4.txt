  "purpose": "The code provides package metadata information for the 'murmurhash' Python package, including title, version, summary, URI, author, email, and license.",
  "sources": "The metadata variables (__title__, __version__, __summary__, __uri__, __author__, __email__, __license__) are assigned string literals.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving user input or untrusted data; the variables are statically assigned values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines package metadata variables with static string values. It includes comments referencing external documentation but contains no dynamic or potentially malicious operations. No external inputs or outputs are involved. The structure is simple and conventional for Python package info modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
