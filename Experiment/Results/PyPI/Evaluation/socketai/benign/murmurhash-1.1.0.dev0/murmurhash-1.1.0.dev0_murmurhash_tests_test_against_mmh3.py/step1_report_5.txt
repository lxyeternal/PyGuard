{
  "purpose": "The code compares hash outputs from two different hashing libraries to verify their consistency.",
  "sources": "Input string variables ('hello world', 'anxiety') used in hash computations.",
  "sinks": "Hash function calls; no data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are fed into both hashing functions, with results compared internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two hashing libraries, 'mmh3' and 'murmurhash.mrmr', and defines a test function that asserts the hashes of specific strings match between the two libraries. The function is straightforward, performing in-memory hash comparisons without external data transmission or secret management. The purpose appears to be validation or testing of hash consistency, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or anomalous constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple validation of hash functions and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for testing purposes only.",
