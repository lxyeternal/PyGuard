{
  "purpose": "Compare hash outputs from two implementations (mmh3 and murmurhash.mrmr) on fixed strings to validate consistency.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings 'hello world' and 'anxiety' within the test function.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network transmission, or data leakage points; all operations are in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input strings are hashed by both libraries; results are compared via assertions within the same process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected; straightforward comparison logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, static hash comparison test on fixed strings using standard libraries. No external inputs, outputs, or side effects are present. The purpose appears to be validating hash consistency. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code is benign and intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward hash validation script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
