{
  "purpose": "The code compares hash outputs from two different hashing libraries to verify consistency.",
  "sources": "Input string variables ('hello world', 'anxiety') used as data for hashing functions.",
  "sinks": "Hash function calls which process the input data; no external data sinks or network transmission detected.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by both hashing libraries; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two hashing libraries, mmh3 and murmurhash.mrmr. It defines a test function that hashes specific strings using both libraries and asserts their outputs are equal. The code appears to be a simple validation test to compare hashing consistency. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations. Usage of hashing libraries is typical, and the code does not perform any network operations or system modifications. It is a benign piece of test code verifying hash function outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic test for hashing functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious logic.",
