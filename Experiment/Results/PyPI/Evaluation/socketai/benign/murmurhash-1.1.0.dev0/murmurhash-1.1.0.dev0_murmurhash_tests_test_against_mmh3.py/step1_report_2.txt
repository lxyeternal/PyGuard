{
  "purpose": "The code compares the output of two different hash functions (mmh3 and murmurhash.mrmr) for specific input strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings defined within the function ('hello world' and 'anxiety'). No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or cause side effects; the code only performs hash comparisons.",
  "flows": "Input strings are hashed by two functions; outputs are compared within assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two hash modules and defines a test function that asserts the consistency of hash outputs for specific strings. It appears to serve as a validation or comparison between two hashing implementations. No external data is read dynamically, and no side effects or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is simple, well-structured, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic test comparing two hashing functions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a straightforward validation task with no suspicious elements.",
