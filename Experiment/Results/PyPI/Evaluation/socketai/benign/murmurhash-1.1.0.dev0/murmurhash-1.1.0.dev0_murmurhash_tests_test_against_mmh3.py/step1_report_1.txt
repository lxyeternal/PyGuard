{
  "purpose": "The code compares hash values generated by two different hashing libraries to verify their consistency.",
  "sources": "The code reads the string variables and the imported hashing functions from the libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data; it only performs hash comparisons locally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are hashed by two functions; the hashes are compared for equality.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The hashing functions used are standard and widely available.",
  "analysis": "The script imports two hashing libraries and performs straightforward hash comparisons on hardcoded string inputs. There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or malicious operations. The hashing functions are standard library functions, and the code's purpose appears to be a simple validation or test of hash consistency. No data leakage, system modification, or network activity is present. The code appears benign and intended for testing or validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic test script comparing hashes from two libraries. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware.",
