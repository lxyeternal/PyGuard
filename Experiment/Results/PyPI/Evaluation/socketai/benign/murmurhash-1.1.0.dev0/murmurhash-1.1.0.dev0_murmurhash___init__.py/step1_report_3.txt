  "purpose": "The code appears to set up environment paths and import functions for hashing from local modules.",
  "sources": "os module for environment-related information; local modules about and mrmr for hashing functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially unsafe data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from sources to sinks; path construction is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local modules, then defines a function to retrieve a directory path relative to the current file. The purpose seems to be setting up an include directory path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. No complex or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, safe, and appears to serve a configuration or setup purpose without malicious intent or security risks.",
