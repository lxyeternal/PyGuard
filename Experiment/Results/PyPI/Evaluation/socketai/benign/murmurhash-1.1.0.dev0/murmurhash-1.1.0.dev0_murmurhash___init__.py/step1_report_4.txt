{
  "purpose": "To define a function that returns the path to an 'include' directory relative to the current file.",
  "sources": "os module for directory and path operations, imports from '.about' and '.mrmr' modules, particularly functions 'hash', 'hash_unicode', 'hash_bytes'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources or output sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply constructs a file path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The imported functions are from trusted libraries, and the function's purpose is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and relative modules, then defines 'get_include' which returns a directory path based on the current script's location. No external input handling, data processing, or potentially malicious operations are present. The imports of 'hash', 'hash_unicode', 'hash_bytes' could be for hashing purposes but do not themselves indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup or resource inclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to locate a resource directory within the package. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
