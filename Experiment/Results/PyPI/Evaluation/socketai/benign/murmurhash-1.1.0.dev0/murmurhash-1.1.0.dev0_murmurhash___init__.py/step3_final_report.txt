  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve the path to the 'include' directory relative to the current file.",

  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) -> os.path.join() in get_include()",
  "anomalies": "Presence of imported cryptographic functions (hash, hash_unicode, hash_bytes) that are not used; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and internal functions, then defines a simple utility to get a directory path. No input/output with untrusted data, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation are present. The imported hash functions are unused, which does not indicate malicious intent but could be misused elsewhere. The code is typical for package setup or utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. The imported cryptographic functions are unused and do not contribute to any security risk in this context. All signals indicate a safe utility module with no security concerns.",
