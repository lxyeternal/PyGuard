  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, straightforward utility code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign utility code, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk (0.1) despite no malicious activity, possibly due to the presence of cryptographic functions, but since they are not used here, this is acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same benign pattern, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, simple path utility, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Utility code with imported hashing functions, but no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Risk Score:** Most are 0, with Report 2 slightly higher at 0.1, which is reasonable considering the presence of cryptographic functions, even if unused here.\n\n**However, considering the overall code:**\n- The code is simple, standard, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The imported functions (`hash`, `hash_unicode`, `hash_bytes`) are not used here but could be relevant elsewhere; their mere presence does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The get_include() function is a typical utility pattern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the provided code snippets and reports, I concur with the assigned scores, with a slight adjustment: all should have a **securityRisk of 0** since there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and logical analysis.",
