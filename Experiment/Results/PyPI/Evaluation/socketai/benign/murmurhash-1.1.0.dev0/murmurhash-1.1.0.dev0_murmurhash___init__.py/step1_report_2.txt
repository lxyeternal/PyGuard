{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package that provides utility functions, such as retrieving include directory paths, and imports cryptographic functions from a submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory path using os.path and imports functions from the .about and .mrmr modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining a function that computes a file path based on the current file location.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward imports and a simple path calculation without suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and relative modules, including cryptographic functions, but does not use them within this snippet. The get_include() function constructs and returns a directory path based on the current file location, which is a common pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hardcoded secrets. The code structure is simple and does not perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be part of a legitimate package structure. No malicious intent or security risks are identified in this snippet.",
