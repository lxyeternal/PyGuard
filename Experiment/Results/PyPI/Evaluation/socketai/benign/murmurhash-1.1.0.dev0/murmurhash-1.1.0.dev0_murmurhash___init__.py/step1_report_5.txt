{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility functions for path management and imports modules and functions, possibly for cryptographic or data processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads from the filesystem to determine the current script's directory and imports functions from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code only retrieves a directory path; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of hashing functions from local modules is standard, though their implementation is unknown.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and functions, then defines a function to obtain the include directory path relative to the current file. There are no inputs from external sources, no data manipulation, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The functions used (hash, hash_unicode, hash_bytes) are imported from internal modules, which are not analyzed here; their purpose could be for hashing or cryptography, but nothing indicates malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard for a utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving a simple utility purpose of determining a directory path. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
