{
  "purpose": "To verify the existence and importability of the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module in a minimal test setup.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import murmurhash.mrmr' reads the module; the assertion 'assert murmurhash.mrmr' checks its truthiness.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; the sink is the assertion verifying the module exists; the flow is straightforward and limited to import and check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic import of 'murmurhash.mrmr' and asserts its existence. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, minimal import check with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No evidence suggests malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assertion is a common pattern in testing environments. Given the simplicity and clarity, the code poses no security threat or malicious risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign import test with no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. All reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
