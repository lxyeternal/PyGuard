{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific function or module 'mrmr' from the 'murmurhash' package and contains a test function to assert its existence.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module or attribute.",
  "sinks": "The assertion checks the existence of 'murmurhash.mrmr', but does not lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; the sink is the assertion that verifies 'murmurhash.mrmr' exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hidden code or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to import 'mrmr' from 'murmurhash' and verify its presence via an assertion. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. The import appears standard for a testing or initialization context. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or malicious intent is evident. The assertion is straightforward and serves as a simple test to confirm the module's availability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic test to confirm the import of a module attribute, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
