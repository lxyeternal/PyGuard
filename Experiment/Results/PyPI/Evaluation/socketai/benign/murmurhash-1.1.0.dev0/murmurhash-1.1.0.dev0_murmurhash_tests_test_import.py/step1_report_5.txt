{
  "purpose": "The code appears to test the importability of the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import murmurhash.mrmr' reads the module from the package or environment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to external effects; the code only asserts the import is successful.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code merely checks module importability.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a minimal import test with an assertion but does not contain anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module and asserts its presence. It is a straightforward import test with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity. The minimal assertion confirms module availability but does not execute or invoke any functionality that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. This is a simple, benign import statement intended for testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import assertion without any malicious intent or security issues. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
