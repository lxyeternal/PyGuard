{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module and tests its importability with an assertion.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the primary source, which loads the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing the module to the assertion check, which verifies the module is loaded correctly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports a module and asserts its existence. It does not process user input, handle network data, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The module import could be legitimate, and the assertion merely confirms the module loads without error.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a simple import test of a Python module. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
