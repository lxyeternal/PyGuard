{
  "purpose": "To verify the successful import of the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module, likely for hashing or related functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'import murmurhash.mrmr'",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established; the code only imports a module and asserts its existence.",
  "anomalies": "The assert statement is trivial and does not verify the correctness of the import; it merely checks that the module exists, which is redundant. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and a simple assertion to check if the module 'murmurhash.mrmr' is imported successfully. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no operations that could lead to data leakage or malicious behavior. The assertion does not perform any validation beyond the import itself. Overall, the code appears benign, serving only as a minimal import check.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import verification with no malicious intent or security risks. It is minimal and does not perform any harmful operations.",
