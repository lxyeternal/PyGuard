  "purpose": "The code is intended to import the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module and test if it is successfully imported.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import murmurhash.mrmr'.",
  "sinks": "The assertion 'assert murmurhash.mrmr' relies on the imported module; no external data sink is present.",
  "flows": "Importing the module as a source; assertion checks if the module is truthy, which is standard and safe.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no unusual constructs, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The assertion is a simple truthiness check, not a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a basic import of the 'murmurhash.mrmr' module and asserts its existence. There are no external inputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward, likely part of a test suite. No malicious or security-compromising actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import test with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
