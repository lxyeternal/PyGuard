  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal header with shebang and encoding declaration, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only comments (shebang and encoding declaration).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely boilerplate headers with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang line and an encoding comment, with no functions, variables, imports, or executable logic. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The code is static and benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. The high confidence scores reflect certainty that the code is harmless. Overall, the code is a harmless placeholder header with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal header with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
