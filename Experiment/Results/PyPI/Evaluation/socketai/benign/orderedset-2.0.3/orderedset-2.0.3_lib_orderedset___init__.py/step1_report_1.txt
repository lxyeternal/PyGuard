{
  "purpose": "Define the package version and import a custom data structure from a local module.",
  "sources": "Reading the module's own version string and importing _orderedset from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a variable and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports a local module '_orderedset'. No external input, environment variables, or data processing occurs. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The import appears standard for package setup, assuming _orderedset is a legitimate local module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic package setup tasks with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
