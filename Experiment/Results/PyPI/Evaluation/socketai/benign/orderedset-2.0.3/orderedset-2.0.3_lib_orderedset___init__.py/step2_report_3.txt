  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal code: setting a version string and importing a local module `_orderedset`.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The code appears standard for package setup or module initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The code snippets match the described purpose: defining `__version__` and importing `_orderedset`.\n- There are no discrepancies between the code and the reports' summaries.\n\n### Are there any issues or malicious elements?\n- No. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The import of `_orderedset` is from a local module, which is typical for custom data structures.\n- The version string is standard metadata.\n\n### Evaluation of scores:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n- Confidence scores are high (1.0 or 0.9), which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or points of challenge:\n- **Claims of benignity** are well-supported; no assumptions are made beyond the code shown.\n- **No inconsistencies** in scoring or reasoning.\n- **No need to adjust scores** based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- If `_orderedset` is a trusted local module, there's no concern.\n- If `_orderedset` were from an untrusted source, that could warrant further review, but based on the context, it appears to be part of the package.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Issue                 | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Comments                                                      |\n|-----------------------|---------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Overall risk**      | 0       | 0            | 0              | The code is benign, with no malicious or risky behavior.     |\n| **Malware justification** | N/A     | N/A          | N/A            | No malicious code or behavior present.                        |\n| **Obfuscation justification** | N/A     | N/A          | N/A            | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation detected.            |\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, and the current scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider context; if the `_orderedset` module were from an untrusted source, that could change the risk profile. However, based on the provided information, the code is benign.",
