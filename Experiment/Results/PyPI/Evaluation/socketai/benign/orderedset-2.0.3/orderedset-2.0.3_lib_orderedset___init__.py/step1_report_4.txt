  "purpose": "Define the package version and import a custom data structure from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__version__' string and imports '_orderedset' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes a version string and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports a module called '_orderedset' from a relative package, which appears to be part of standard package setup. There are no inputs, outputs, or data handling that could be exploited. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module with versioning and import statements. No malicious or security risks are identified.",
