  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization: defining version and importing a local module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ and import of _orderedset from local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static code with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup: setting a version string and importing a local module. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the code content. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
