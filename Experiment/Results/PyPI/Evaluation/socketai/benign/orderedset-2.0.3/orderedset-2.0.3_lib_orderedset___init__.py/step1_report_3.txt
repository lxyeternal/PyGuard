{
  "purpose": "Defines a package version and imports a custom ordered set data structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable assignment and imports from a local module '_orderedset'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present; no sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns a version string and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version identifier and imports a module, which appears to be a standard part of a package's __init__.py or similar. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leaks. The import statement indicates reliance on a local module, which is typical for custom data structures. No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
