  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports a class from a local module. Both actions are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be normal, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It merely declares a version and imports a class, which is common in Python modules.",
