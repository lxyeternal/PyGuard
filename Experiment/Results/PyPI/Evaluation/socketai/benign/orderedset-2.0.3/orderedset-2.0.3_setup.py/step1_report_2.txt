  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'orderedset' Python package, including dependencies, versioning, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads README and HISTORY files for long description; reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; reads version from 'lib/orderedset/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations; no external data or untrusted inputs are used unsafely.",
  "flows": "Read files to gather package info and dependencies, then pass data to 'setup()' for package building and distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. The code performs standard setup tasks. The try-except block for Cython extension is common practice.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata, dependencies, and version info from static files, and configures package setup parameters. The import of Cython is handled safely with fallback. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to typical setup.py conventions without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It performs expected tasks for package installation and configuration.",
