  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'orderedset' Python package, handling package metadata, dependencies, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading README, HISTORY, requirements.txt, and version info from lib/orderedset/__init__.py.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources are directly used in potentially dangerous operations like network access or command execution.",
  "flows": "Reading files (readme, history, requirements, version) with no untrusted input involved, then passing data to setup() with no external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The use of try-except for optional Cython compilation is standard. No hardcoded secrets, malicious backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for package metadata and dependencies, and sets up the package configuration. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code follows standard setup procedures with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
