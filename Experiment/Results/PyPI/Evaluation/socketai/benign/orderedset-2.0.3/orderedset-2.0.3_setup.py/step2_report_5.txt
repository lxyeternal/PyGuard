  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project (`orderedset`). The script reads static files (README, HISTORY, requirements), extracts version info via regex, and configures build extensions with optional Cython compilation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:  \n   None of the reports identify suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs. The code adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Security Concerns**:  \n   - The script reads files that could, in theory, contain malicious content, but this is outside static analysis scope.\n   - No network activity, command execution, or dynamic data handling is observed.\n   - The only minor concern could be if the files read (`README.rst`, `HISTORY.rst`, `requirements.txt`, `__init__.py`) are malicious, but this is not evident from the code itself.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — Clear, standard code.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities are evident in the static code.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The risk scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0  \n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a typical, benign `setup.py` script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard package setup tasks safely.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would concur with the provided scores: **malware = 0.0**, **obfuscated = 0.0**, **risk = 0.0**.",
