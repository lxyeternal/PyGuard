  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the redshift-serverless service in boto3, providing a structured interface for API calls and paginators.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property definitions, especially in the RedshiftServerlessClient class.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly. Methods return data, types, or dictionaries. No untrusted data processing or external commands are present.",
  "flows": "Method signatures define source-to-sink flows: input parameters (kwargs) into API calls and returning typed responses; no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of standard boto3 and botocore classes. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs. No network connections or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class structures, and method signatures for a boto3 client. It imports necessary modules, defines exception types, and provides overloads for paginators. There are no code execution, dynamic code evaluation, or data leakage mechanisms. All components align with standard SDK interface definitions. The overall structure appears legitimate and intended for type checking and IDE support. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SDK client interface with extensive type annotations for AWS Redshift Serverless. It contains no malicious code or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate type-safe API interactions. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks is detected.",
