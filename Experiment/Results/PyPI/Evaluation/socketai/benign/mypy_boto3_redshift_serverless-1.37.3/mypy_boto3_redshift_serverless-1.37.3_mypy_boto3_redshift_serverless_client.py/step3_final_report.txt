  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the boto3 Redshift Serverless client, serving as a static type stub for IDE support and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports of type definitions, method signatures, and class properties; no runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types; no external data flows, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Method calls with request parameters leading to AWS API interactions; no untrusted data processing within the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static type stub for the AWS SDK's Redshift Serverless client, containing only method signatures, type annotations, and class structures. It does not include executable logic, data processing, or external effects. The absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns indicates it is a benign interface used for static type checking. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given its nature as a type stub.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, well-structured static type interface for the AWS Redshift Serverless client. It contains no malicious or obfuscated content, and the security risk is negligible.",
