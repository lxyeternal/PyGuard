  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the Amazon Redshift Serverless service in boto3, providing structured access to service operations with type hints.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, botocore exceptions, and internal module types; class and method definitions, including properties, methods, and overloads.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters with **kwargs unpacked into specific request types; methods returning data or performing actions; properties accessing exception classes.",
  "flows": "Method calls receive input parameters, often unpacked from type definitions; methods interact with AWS services via boto3, returning response types; exception properties provide error types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present; code strictly defines a client interface with type annotations, following standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type-annotated interface for the AWS Redshift Serverless client, utilizing standard Python typing and method signatures aligned with boto3 conventions. The import statements and class structure follow typical patterns. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The code solely provides type hints and method signatures for interacting with AWS services, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured client interface definition with type annotations for AWS Redshift Serverless operations. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is purely to enable type checking and IDE support for boto3 interactions.",
