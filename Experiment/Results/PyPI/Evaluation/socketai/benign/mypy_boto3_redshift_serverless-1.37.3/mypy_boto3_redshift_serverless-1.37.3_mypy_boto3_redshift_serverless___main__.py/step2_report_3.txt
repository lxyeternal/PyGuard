  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or network activity.\n   - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - The code is minimal, clear, and serves an informational purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and low risk.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0, as currently assigned.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports are cautious and do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a standard CLI utility with static outputs, typical for package info scripts.\n- No hidden or malicious features are present.\n- The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n**Summary**: Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores. The code is safe, benign, and poses no security risks.",
