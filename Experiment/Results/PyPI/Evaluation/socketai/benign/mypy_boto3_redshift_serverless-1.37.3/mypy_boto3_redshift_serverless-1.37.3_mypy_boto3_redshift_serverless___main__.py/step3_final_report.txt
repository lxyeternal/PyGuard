  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout (`sys.stdout.write`), no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to printing version or info; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on arguments. It performs no dynamic operations, network activity, or data processing. The code is well-structured, with functions clearly separated, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. All signals indicate benign intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature imply zero security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security issues. It accurately reports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, consistent with its behavior.",
