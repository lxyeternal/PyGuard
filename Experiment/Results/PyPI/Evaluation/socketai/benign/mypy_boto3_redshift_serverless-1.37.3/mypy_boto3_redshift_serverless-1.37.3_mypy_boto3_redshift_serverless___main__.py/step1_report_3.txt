  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package providing informational output about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) -> print_version() -> sys.stdout.write output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script simply checks for a '--version' argument and outputs package info or version details accordingly. It imports only standard library modules (sys). The functions are straightforward and only perform print operations. No untrusted input processing beyond command-line args, which are standard and benign. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
