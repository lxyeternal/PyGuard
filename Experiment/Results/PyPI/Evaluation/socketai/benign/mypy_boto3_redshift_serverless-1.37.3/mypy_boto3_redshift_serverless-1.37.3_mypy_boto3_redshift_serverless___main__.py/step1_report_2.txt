  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 RedshiftServerless, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments from sys.argv, writing package info and version info to stdout.",
  "sinks": "stdout (print_info and print_version functions), command-line argument parsing.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in sys.argv, call print_version and terminate; otherwise, call print_info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs straightforward informational output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines two functions to output package details and version information to stdout, and a main function that chooses which info to print based on command-line arguments. The script only outputs static strings and does not perform any network operations, data collection, or dynamic code execution. No input sanitization concerns or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. It appears to serve as an informational entry point with no security risks.",
