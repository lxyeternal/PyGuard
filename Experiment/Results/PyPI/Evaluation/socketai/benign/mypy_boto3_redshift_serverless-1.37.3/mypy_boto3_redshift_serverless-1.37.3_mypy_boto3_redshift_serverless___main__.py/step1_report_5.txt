  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for displaying package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 RedshiftServerless.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs data to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), reads command-line arguments",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' flows from sys.argv to the conditional check, then triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and based on the presence of '--version', outputs either version info or package info to stdout. No untrusted data sources, external network calls, or risky behaviors are present. The code is simple and clean with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data leakage. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. It strictly serves informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. It contains no malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign and well-structured utility with no malicious intent.",
