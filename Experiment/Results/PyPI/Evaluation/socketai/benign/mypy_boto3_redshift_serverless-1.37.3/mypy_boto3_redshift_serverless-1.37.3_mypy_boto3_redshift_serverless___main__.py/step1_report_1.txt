  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writes package info and version info to standard output.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info(); output flows to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and primarily outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool that outputs package and version information. It reads command-line input and outputs static, hardcoded strings. No external data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The functions are minimal and serve clear purposes without any suspicious logic. Overall, the code is benign and serves a standard informational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious CLI utility with no security risks. It simply outputs static package info and version details when invoked.",
