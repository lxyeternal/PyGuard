  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Clearly states the code is a boilerplate SDK wrapper with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (moderate due to being boilerplate but no actual security risk).  \n- **Justification:** Since it's a standard SDK interface with no suspicious code, the risk score could be lowered to 0.1 or 0, but 0.5 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK setup without suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly higher than 0, but still minimal).  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; straightforward SDK interface, no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 or 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** No security issues; risk score can be lowered to 0.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 or 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** No security concern; risk score can be minimized.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusion; standard SDK setup, documentation, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 or 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** No security issues; risk score can be minimized.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. **Estimated malware score: 0.0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; straightforward code. **Estimated obfuscated score: 0.0**  \n- **Risk Score:** The code is purely boilerplate SDK setup with no data leaks, no external inputs, no network activity beyond standard SDK calls. The only minor concern is that it's a boilerplate, which might be considered slightly risky if misused, but as-is, it's benign. **Estimated risk score: 0.0 to 0.1**  \n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code, which is standard SDK interface code with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
