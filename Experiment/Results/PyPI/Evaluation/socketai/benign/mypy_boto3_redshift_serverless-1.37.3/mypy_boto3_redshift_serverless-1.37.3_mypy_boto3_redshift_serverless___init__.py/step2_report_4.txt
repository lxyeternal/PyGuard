  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes a standard SDK wrapper setup.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No untrusted data, no suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confirmed as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard SDK setup.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No data leaks or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; standard module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slight securityRisk score seems to reflect the fact that this code interacts with external services, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present. This seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on documentation and import structure.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No untrusted data, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, standard SDK setup.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No untrusted data or suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is high, and the assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK interface.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No data leaks or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. All consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. Given the code's nature—simple imports, client setup, documentation—the malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are appropriate at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The only minor point is the securityRisk score in Report 2 (0.1), which seems to reflect the code's interaction with external AWS services. Since there's no actual vulnerability or malicious behavior, this score could be slightly lowered to **0** for consistency, but the current value is not unreasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 in Report 2, but for consistency, 0 is preferable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores in the reports are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis.",
