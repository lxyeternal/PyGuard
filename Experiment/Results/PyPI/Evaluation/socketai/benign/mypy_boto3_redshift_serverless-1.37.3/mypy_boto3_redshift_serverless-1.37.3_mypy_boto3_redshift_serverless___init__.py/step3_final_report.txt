{
  "purpose": "Provides a boilerplate SDK interface for AWS Redshift Serverless, importing client and paginator classes, and setting up the client instance.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SDK classes and client initialization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network or data leaks, no external input processing.",
  "flows": "Standard SDK method calls without data flow from untrusted sources; no dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK wrapper module with documentation, class imports, and client setup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations beyond SDK calls, or contain hidden logic. The minimal risk and malware scores are appropriate at zero. The slight variation in risk scores across reports (e.g., 0.1) can be considered an overestimation; a score of 0 aligns better with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate SDK interface for AWS Redshift Serverless with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware and obfuscated scores should be set to 0, and the overall security risk is effectively zero.",
