  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code, or external inputs are involved.\n- The code is standard boilerplate used in Python packages for versioning.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only minor anomaly noted is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright comment, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Review of scores:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is also correctly 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The overall risk score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Any issues or inconsistencies?**\n- No. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- I agree with all the provided scores.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, benign version declaration with no security concerns.",
