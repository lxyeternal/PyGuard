  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The version string assignment is static and does not involve data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a static assignment of the __version__ variable to a string '1.37.3'. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious constructs present. This is a typical version declaration commonly used in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It contains no obfuscated or malicious behavior and appears to be a safe, typical part of a package.",
