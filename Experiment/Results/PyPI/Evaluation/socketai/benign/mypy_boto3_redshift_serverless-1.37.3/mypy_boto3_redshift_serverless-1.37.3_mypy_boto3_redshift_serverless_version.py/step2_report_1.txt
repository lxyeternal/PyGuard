  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output, or external data flows.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious activity are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - This aligns with the code's straightforward purpose.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n   - No issues here.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - Scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a minimal, standard version declaration typical in Python projects. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action required.",
