  "purpose": "Defines a version string as the source of truth for the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable with a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains a straightforward version assignment, no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets the __version__ variable to a static string '1.37.3' with an associated copyright comment. There are no data input sources, no processing, and no data sinks. No dynamic code execution, no hidden behaviors, no credential storage, or malicious logic. The code appears to serve as a static version indicator, which is a common practice in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a source of truth for version information and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
