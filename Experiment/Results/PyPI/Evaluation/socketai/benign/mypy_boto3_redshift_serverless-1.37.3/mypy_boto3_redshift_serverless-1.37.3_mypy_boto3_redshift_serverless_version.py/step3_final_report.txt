  "flows": "Direct assignment from a static string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a copyright comment. No dynamic code, input/output, external data sources, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a common boilerplate in Python projects for versioning. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The only minor anomaly is the future year 2025 in the comment, which does not impact security. The scores assigned by all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign appropriate scores. No further action is necessary.",
