  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple Python module that assigns a version string (`\"1.37.3\"`) to the `__version__` variable.\n   - It includes a copyright comment with the year 2025.\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n   - The code is a common pattern used for versioning in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is straightforward, static, and minimal.\n\n3. **Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is not obfuscated; it is clear and readable.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Anomalies and Notable Points:**\n   - The only anomaly noted is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is unusual but not malicious.\n   - No suspicious code patterns, secrets, or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n6. **Scores Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores given by all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n   - Since the code is a typical version declaration, no change in scores is necessary.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n   - The reports correctly identify it as such.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The only minor point is the future year in the comment, which is not a security concern but could be flagged as a documentation inconsistency. However, it does not impact security assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The original scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided. The code is safe, benign, and standard for version declaration.",
