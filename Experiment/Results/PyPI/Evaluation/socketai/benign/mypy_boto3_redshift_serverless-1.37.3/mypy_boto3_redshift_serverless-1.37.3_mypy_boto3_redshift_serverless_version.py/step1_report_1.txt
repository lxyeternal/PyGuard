  "purpose": "Define and store the version number of the package",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a version string and a copyright comment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that sets a version string variable, which is common in Python packages. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The comment indicates authorship but does not affect execution. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a version identifier and contains no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is a typical pattern used in Python projects to specify package versioning.",
