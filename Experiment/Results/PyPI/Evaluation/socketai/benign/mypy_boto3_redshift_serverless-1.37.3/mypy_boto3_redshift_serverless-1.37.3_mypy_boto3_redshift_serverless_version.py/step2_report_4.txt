  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The code does not contain any dynamic code, input/output, or external data sources.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is standard practice in Python projects for versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a high risk score; all are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is a static version string assignment, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and standard practice.\n   - The mention of a future year (2025) in the copyright comment is noted but not suspicious.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a minimal, typical version declaration pattern.\n- No hidden or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The comments and code structure are standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a simple, benign version string assignment with no security concerns.",
