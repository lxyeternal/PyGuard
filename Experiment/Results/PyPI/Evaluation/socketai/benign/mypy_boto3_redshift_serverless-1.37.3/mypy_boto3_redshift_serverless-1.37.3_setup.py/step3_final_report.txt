  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-redshift-serverless package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Passes static data to setuptools.setup(), no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads file content and supplies static arguments to setup(), no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It imports necessary modules, reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata. There are no user inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The dependency specification is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and follows common packaging practices, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe and straightforward code.",
