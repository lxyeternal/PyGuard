  "purpose": "Type annotations for redshift-serverless service client paginators.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method signatures accepting **kwargs, importing type definitions, and internal paginator inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (**kwargs) passed directly to boto3's internal paginator methods; no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard pattern for SDK stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions, type annotations, conditional imports, and documentation links. The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs, which are passed to boto3's internal paginator functions, but no data is processed or transmitted outside the SDK. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The structure aligns with typical boto3 stub implementations, serving as a static type hinting layer. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and class definitions for boto3 paginators related to AWS Redshift Serverless. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, static SDK stub module.",
