  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginators for the redshift-serverless boto3 client, providing structured access to paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions imported from '.type_defs'; method parameters in 'paginate' functions.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or untrusted data sources present; 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs with type annotations, no external input processing.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs to 'paginate' methods, which produce PageIterator objects; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward type annotation wrappers; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines typed paginators for AWS Redshift Serverless API using boto3, with type checking, conditional imports for 'Unpack', and no dynamic code execution. The structure is consistent with standard SDK extension patterns. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, network activity, or suspicious logic found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a type-safe, well-structured set of paginator classes for boto3, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a static type hinting layer for AWS SDK paginators.",
