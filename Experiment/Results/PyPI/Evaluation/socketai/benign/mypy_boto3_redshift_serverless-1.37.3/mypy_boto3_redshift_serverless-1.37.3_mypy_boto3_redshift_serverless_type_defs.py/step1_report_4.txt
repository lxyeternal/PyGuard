{
  "purpose": "The code provides type definitions for various data structures used in the redshift-serverless service, including requests, responses, and resource schemas, primarily to support type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The source code reads only static type annotations, constants, imports, and does not process any external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command executions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines data structures and types used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, and imports. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and NotRequired to specify data structures for the redshift-serverless SDK. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard. No external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The content appears consistent with auto-generated or hand-written type annotations for SDK responses and requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the structure aligns with common practices for type stubs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions used for type hinting and documentation purposes. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the logic is limited to static type annotations. Therefore, it poses no security risk.",
