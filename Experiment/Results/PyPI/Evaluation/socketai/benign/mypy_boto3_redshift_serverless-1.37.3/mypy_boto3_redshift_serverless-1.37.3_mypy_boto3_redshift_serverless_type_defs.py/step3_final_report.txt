  "assessment": "The code consists solely of static type annotations for AWS Redshift Serverless SDK data structures, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. It uses standard Python typing practices, conditional imports for compatibility, and TypedDicts to define request/response schemas. No malicious behavior, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Multiple independent reviews confirm the benign nature of this code. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, and the code is safe for use as SDK support or static type checking. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
