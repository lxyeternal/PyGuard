  "purpose": "Define type annotations for Redshift Serverless service data structures, requests, responses, and configurations for use with boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, type annotations, and import statements; no runtime input handling or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only defines types and data structures without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of __future__ imports and conditional imports based on sys.version_info are standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and Union definitions for typing support in Python, primarily for type checking and IDE support. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no runtime data manipulations, external calls, or code execution features. No obfuscated code patterns or dynamic execution mechanisms are present. All elements are static type definitions for API data structures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations intended for static type checking. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears to be an auto-generated or manually maintained type definitions file for AWS Redshift Serverless SDK support.",
