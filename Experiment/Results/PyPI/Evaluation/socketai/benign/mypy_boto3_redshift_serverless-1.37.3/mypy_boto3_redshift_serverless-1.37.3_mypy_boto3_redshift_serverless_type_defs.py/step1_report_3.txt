{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for Redshift Serverless service interactions, including request and response schemas.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from literals, module imports, and type definitions that set up data schemas and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data is directly used in a security-sensitive manner; primarily type definitions and data schemas.",
  "flows": "Data flows are schema definitions from source to sink within type annotations, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. Usage of __future__ imports and conditional imports based on sys.version_info are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines TypedDict classes for request and response schemas used by the AWS SDK for Redshift Serverless. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions and detailed type annotations for various API data structures. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data manipulation is present. The code is static, structured, and aligned with standard SDK type definition practices. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of type annotations and data schema definitions for AWS SDK interactions with Redshift Serverless. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate and standard part of a type stubs package for type checking.",
