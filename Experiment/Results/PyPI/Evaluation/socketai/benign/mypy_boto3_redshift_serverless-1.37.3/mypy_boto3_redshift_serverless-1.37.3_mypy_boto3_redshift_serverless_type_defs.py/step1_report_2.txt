  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for Redshift Serverless service type definitions, primarily used for API data modeling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias definitions, and TypedDict class definitions for various API request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to static type annotations and data models without any runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type definitions and data models for a Python SDK interacting with AWS Redshift Serverless. It uses standard Python typing modules, conditional imports for compatibility, and TypedDict for structured data. There are no runtime functions, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious code patterns. All elements are static type annotations intended for type checking, not for execution. The license comment and documentation links are typical and do not pose security issues. The code appears well-structured and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type annotations and data schemas for API interactions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain any malicious or sabotage elements.",
