  "purpose": "Type definitions for Redshift Serverless service API data structures, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys module for Python version detection, and local module literals.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that execute untrusted data or perform side effects; the code primarily defines typed dictionaries.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; type annotations do not execute or evaluate runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present. The code consists solely of type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for version detection and typing, then defines multiple TypedDict classes for structured data representations used in the API. No dynamic execution, string evaluation, network calls, or runtime data handling is present. The module serves as a static type definition library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a purely declarative set of type annotations for the Redshift Serverless API, with no suspicious or malicious elements. It appears to be a legitimate, safe, and standard type definition module intended for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
