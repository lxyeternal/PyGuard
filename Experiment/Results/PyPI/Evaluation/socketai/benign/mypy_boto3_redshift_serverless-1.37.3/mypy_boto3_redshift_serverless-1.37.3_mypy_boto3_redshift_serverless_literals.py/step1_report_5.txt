{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service identifiers, pagination names, and status types using Python type annotations.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions assigning Literal types to constants; import statements for conditional typing support.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; purely static definitions with no data handling or processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The only noteworthy aspect is the version-dependent import of 'Literal' but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static set of type alias declarations for string literals, intended for type hinting in a larger codebase. It uses conditional imports to support different Python versions, which is normal. There are no functions, data processing, external input handling, or dynamic code execution. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is purely declarative and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type alias declaration for AWS resource identifiers and related string literals. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
