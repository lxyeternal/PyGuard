{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS Redshift Serverless service identifiers and related types to facilitate static type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "The module sources data from static string literals assigned to variables, and the import of 'Literal' from typing or typing_extensions depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic flows or data transformations; data flows from static definitions to type annotations used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code includes a version check for importing 'Literal' which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, runtime network operations, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a set of string literal types for use in static type annotations, which enhances code clarity and type safety. It includes a version check to import 'Literal' appropriately based on Python version, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or malicious side effects. The license comment and documentation link are harmless and serve documentation purposes. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign type definitions file used to improve static type checking. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with typical SDK or API type definitions.",
