  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS Redshift Serverless service constants to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module to check Python version; defining string literals for various AWS service and resource names.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or processing logic; solely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional import; all other code consists of static string literals and type annotations without dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS service string constants using Python's Literal type, with a version check for importing Literal from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It is purely static and intended for type safety. No input/output, data processing, or external communication exists. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static definitions module intended for type safety in AWS SDKs. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
