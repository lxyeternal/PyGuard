  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS Redshift Serverless service literals, defining specific string constants for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions assigned to variables using Literal type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network communication, or data output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward type annotation definitions with no unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a conditional Literal type based on Python version and defines numerous string literal constants for various AWS resource types, actions, and regions. There are no input handling, data processing, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constant definitions used for type annotations related to AWS Redshift Serverless service. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely declarative and for type safety.",
