  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS Redshift Serverless service literal definitions and related resource identifiers, facilitating static type checking.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for resource and service names, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static definitions without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static type alias definitions with version check.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS resource identifiers. It uses standard practices like conditional import for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or runtime data processing. The purpose is for static type annotations, with no external or dynamic code involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module for AWS SDK type annotations. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores.",
