{
  "purpose": "Provides Django database routing to direct read queries to replica databases and write queries to the default database, managing load balancing and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Settings attributes 'REPLICA_DATABASES' or 'SLAVE_DATABASES', and the function get_replica() which selects a replica alias.",
  "sinks": "The get_replica() function returns a database alias; no external or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: settings.REPLICA_DATABASES or settings.SLAVE_DATABASES; flow: get_replica() called in db_for_read() to select a replica database alias.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.shuffle() for load balancing, dynamic modification of settings.DATABASES during runtime for test mirror setup, and deprecation warnings for old settings; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Django database routing with round-robin load balancing via itertools.cycle, and manages deprecation warnings. It modifies test database configurations dynamically, which is typical for testing environments. No network activity, code injection, or secret handling is present. The code is straightforward, using common Python and Django constructs, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django database router managing read/write separation with load balancing. It contains no malware, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The warnings relate to configuration practices, not security vulnerabilities.",
