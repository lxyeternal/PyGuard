  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code integrity, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code manages database routing with no signs of malware. It uses standard Django patterns, warnings, and randomization for load balancing. No suspicious network or data exfiltration activities are evident.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal, mainly configuration warnings.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on configuration handling, warnings, and load balancing. No malicious activity is apparent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly identifies the code's purpose and safety.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code again handles routing, with deprecation warnings and load distribution. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is found.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, as expected.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is accurate; no red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard routing, with configuration warnings and test mirror setup. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on routing, warnings, and load balancing. No malicious intent or suspicious features.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no code injection, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low (mostly 0.1–0.2), reflecting the code's benign nature, primarily configuration warnings and standard load balancing logic.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent and standard.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, related to configuration warnings, not security threats.\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical Django database router implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond misconfiguration warnings.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal, primarily related to configuration management rather than security flaws.",
