  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for validating input values against a list of valid options, including generating close matches for suggestions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'passed', 'valid', and 'input' in get_formatted_close_matches function, which are derived from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or system compromise. No network, file system, or sensitive data access occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('passed', 'valid', 'input') through validation and matching functions, with no external or insecure data handling or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. Functions perform straightforward validation and string matching. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for input validation, using standard libraries and straightforward logic. It checks if inputs are within valid options, provides suggestions for close matches, and raises exceptions for invalid data. The only external interaction is the use of 'pretty_print.iterable' for formatting output, which appears to be a harmless utility. No network or file system access, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The functions rely solely on standard Python features and clear control flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as an input validation helper with safe, standard logic. No indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
