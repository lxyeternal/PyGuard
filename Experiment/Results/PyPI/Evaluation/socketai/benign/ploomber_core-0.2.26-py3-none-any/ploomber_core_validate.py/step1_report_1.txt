{
  "purpose": "The code provides validation functions to check if given values are within a list of valid options, offering suggestions for close matches.",
  "sources": "Inputs are taken from function parameters: 'passed', 'valid', and optionally 'name'. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a ValidationError with a descriptive message. No direct data leaks, network communication, or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'passed' is validated against 'valid'. If invalid, an error message is constructed, potentially including close match suggestions, then an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious backdoors. Usage of standard library and helper functions appears safe.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs input validation with comparison against valid options. It uses difflib to suggest close matches for invalid inputs. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious data manipulation, or external communication. The code raises exceptions for validation failures, which is standard. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for validation with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard validation utility with no malicious behavior detected. It performs input validation, error messaging, and close match suggestions without any harmful operations or external data transmission.",
