  "purpose": "Define a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue deprecation warnings while logging telemetry data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'telemetry' and 'message' in deprecation_warning function.",
  "sinks": "The 'warn' function outputs the warning message; telemetry.log_api logs data, potentially sending info over the network.",
  "flows": "The message parameter flows from function argument to warn(), and telemetry object methods log data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. Usage of 'warn' and telemetry logging are standard for warning and telemetry purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class inheriting from FutureWarning. The deprecation_warning function issues a warning message and logs telemetry data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The telemetry object may send data over the network, but this is typical for telemetry and not malicious by itself. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard telemetry and warning logic for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks. The telemetry logging could potentially transmit data, but this is consistent with common telemetry practices and not inherently malicious.",
