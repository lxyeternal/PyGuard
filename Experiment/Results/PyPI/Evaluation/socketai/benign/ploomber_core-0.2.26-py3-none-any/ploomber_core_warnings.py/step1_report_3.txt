  "purpose": "Define a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue warnings and log telemetry data",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'telemetry' and 'message'",
  "sinks": "The 'warn' function outputs warnings; telemetry.log_api sends data over the network",
  "flows": "deprecation_warning calls warn() to display warning and telemetry.log_api to log event",
  "anomalies": "Use of telemetry object for logging may send data externally; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class and a function to issue warnings and log telemetry. The telemetry object is used to log an action with associated message, which could potentially transmit data externally. However, no sensitive data, credentials, or malicious actions are present. The function is straightforward and intended for user notification and telemetry logging. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for deprecation warnings with telemetry logging. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
