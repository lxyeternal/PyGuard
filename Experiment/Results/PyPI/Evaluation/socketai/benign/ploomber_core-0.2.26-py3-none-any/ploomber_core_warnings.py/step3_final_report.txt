  "purpose": "Defines a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue warnings and log telemetry data.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'telemetry' and 'message' provided at runtime; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "telemetry.log_api method potentially transmits data over the network; 'warn' outputs warnings.",
  "flows": "Message flows from 'message' parameter to warning output and telemetry log via 'telemetry.log_api'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard warning and telemetry logging mechanisms without obfuscation or malicious intent. The telemetry object could transmit data externally, posing a potential privacy concern, but no evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration exists. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate, reflecting a minimal security concern due to telemetry data transmission but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for deprecation warnings with telemetry logging. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security consideration is the potential for telemetry data leakage, which is typical in telemetry-enabled systems but not inherently malicious. The scores are consistent with this assessment, and no adjustments are necessary.",
