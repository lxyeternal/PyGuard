  "purpose": "Define a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue deprecation warnings while logging telemetry data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the deprecation_warning function: telemetry object and message string.",
  "sinks": "The telemetry.log_api method potentially sends data to an external service, including the warning message.",
  "flows": "The message parameter flows into the warn() function and telemetry.log_api() call, potentially transmitting the message externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard warning and logging mechanisms without obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class inheriting from FutureWarning, indicating deprecation. The deprecation_warning function issues a warning via the warn() function and logs an API call with telemetry.log_api, including the message. Both actions are typical for deprecation notices; the telemetry interaction might transmit data, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, unsafe code, or obfuscated features. Its purpose appears to be benign, related to user notifications and telemetry.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, implementing a standard deprecation warning mechanism with telemetry logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
