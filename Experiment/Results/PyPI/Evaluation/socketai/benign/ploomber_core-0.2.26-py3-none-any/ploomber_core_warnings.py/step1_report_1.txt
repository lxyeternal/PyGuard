  "purpose": "Define a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue deprecation warnings while logging telemetry data.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs; it defines classes and functions with parameters supplied at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The telemetry.log_api function may send data over the network, potentially leaking warning messages if misused.",
  "flows": "The deprecation_warning function receives a message and telemetry object, warns the user, and logs the message via telemetry.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a custom warning class and a function that issues a warning and logs telemetry data. The telemetry object is expected to have a log_api method that is called with specific parameters. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of warnings and telemetry logging appears standard for monitoring deprecated features. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for handling deprecation warnings with telemetry logging. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The telemetry logging could potentially leak data if misused, but in the context provided, it seems benign.",
