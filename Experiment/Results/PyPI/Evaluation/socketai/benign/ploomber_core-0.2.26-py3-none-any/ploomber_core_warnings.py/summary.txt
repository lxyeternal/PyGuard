  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for deprecation warnings with telemetry logging. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security consideration is the potential for telemetry data leakage, which is typical in telemetry-enabled systems but not inherently malicious. The scores are consistent with this assessment, and no adjustments are necessary."
