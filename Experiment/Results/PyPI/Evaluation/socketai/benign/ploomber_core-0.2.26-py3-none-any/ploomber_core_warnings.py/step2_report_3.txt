  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a custom warning class `PloomberDeprecationWarning` inheriting from `FutureWarning`.\n- Implements `deprecation_warning(telemetry, message)` which:\n  - Issues a warning with `warn(message, FutureWarning)`.\n  - Logs telemetry data via `telemetry.log_api(action=\"deprecation-warning-shown\", metadata={\"message\": message})`.\n\n**Security review:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious API calls are detected.\n   - The code performs standard warning issuance and telemetry logging.\n   - The telemetry object is expected to have a `log_api` method, which may send data over the network, but this is typical in telemetry systems.\n\n2. **Potential Risks:**\n   - The only concern is that telemetry data, including warning messages, could be transmitted externally, possibly leaking sensitive info if messages contain sensitive data.\n   - No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Behavioral Analysis:**\n   - The code is straightforward, intended for internal deprecation notices.\n   - Uses standard Python warning and logging practices.\n   - No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Security risk score:** 0.2 (due to telemetry data potentially being transmitted externally, but this is typical and not inherently malicious)\n   - **Overall risk score:** Given the benign nature, a low but non-zero score is justified.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify the telemetry logging as a potential data transmission point but not malicious.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 or 1), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Any discrepancies or issues?**\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 reflects the potential for data leakage via telemetry, which is appropriate.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The overall malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score can be maintained at 0.2, acknowledging telemetry data transmission but not maliciousness.\n- The overall risk score should be low, around 0.2, consistent with the current assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard implementation for deprecation warnings with telemetry logging. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is the potential leakage of warning messages via telemetry, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's behavior.",
