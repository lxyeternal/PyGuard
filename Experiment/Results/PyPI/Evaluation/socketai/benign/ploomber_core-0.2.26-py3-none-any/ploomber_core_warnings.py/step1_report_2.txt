  "purpose": "Define a custom deprecation warning class and a function to issue warnings while logging telemetry data.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'message' in deprecation_warning function, 'telemetry' parameter providing logging capability.",
  "sinks": "The 'message' string used in warning output, 'telemetry.log_api' method for telemetry logging.",
  "flows": "The 'message' flows from the function parameter into the warn() call and into telemetry.log_api as metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious API calls, no external data fetching or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom warning class and a function to emit deprecation warnings while logging telemetry data. The 'warn' function uses FutureWarning, which is standard for deprecation notices. The 'telemetry.log_api' call logs an action with associated message metadata, which is typical in telemetry systems. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication outside logging. The code appears straightforward, intended for internal deprecation warnings and telemetry, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for issuing warnings and logging telemetry. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
