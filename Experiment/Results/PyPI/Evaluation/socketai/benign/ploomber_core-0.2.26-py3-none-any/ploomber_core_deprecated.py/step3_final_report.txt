  "purpose": "Utility functions and decorators for issuing deprecation warnings, parameter renaming, default value changes, and method/function deprecation notices.",
  "sources": "String parameters (version info, parameter names/values), function/method names, class names",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() calls that emit deprecation warnings",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> conditional checks -> warnings.warn() -> user notification",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, relying on standard Python modules to issue warnings about deprecated functions, parameters, or default values. It reads string inputs and uses decorators to mark functions/methods as deprecated. No external data, network activity, or data leaks are present. The logic is simple and intended solely for user notification, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for deprecation warnings without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.0-0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
