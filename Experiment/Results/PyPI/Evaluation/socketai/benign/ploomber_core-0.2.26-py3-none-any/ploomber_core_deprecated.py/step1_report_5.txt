{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions for handling deprecated and renamed parameters, functions, and methods, including issuing warnings and managing default values in a controlled manner.",
  "sources": "Code imports warnings, functools.wraps, and a custom warning class; it reads parameters for deprecation, renaming, and default change handling.",
  "sinks": "Warnings generated with deprecation messages; no data is directly sent to external systems or used insecurely within the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters for deprecation/renaming functions flow into warning generation; decorated functions/methods invoke warnings upon calls, passing control to the wrapper functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely issues warnings and manages parameter states; there are no indications of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. Usage of warnings and decorators is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple utility functions for managing deprecation, renaming, and default value changes, primarily through warnings. It uses the standard warnings library and wraps functions/methods to warn users of deprecated APIs. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation is detected. The code's structure and logic are typical for deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for deprecation warnings and parameter management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appropriately warns users about deprecated features without performing harmful actions or data leaks.",
