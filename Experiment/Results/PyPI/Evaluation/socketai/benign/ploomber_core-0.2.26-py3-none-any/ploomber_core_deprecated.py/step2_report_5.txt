  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code is for deprecation warnings; sources are string parameters and function/method names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Warnings are emitted via `warnings.warn()`, no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, standard deprecation utility functions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is benign with no security risks and a confidence of 1.0 is justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero but acceptable given the nature of warnings, not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent logic and no malicious indicators.  \n- No external system interactions, no obfuscation, straightforward warning issuance.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Same as above; purely deprecation warnings, no suspicious behavior.  \n- No external data handling or malicious constructs.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Again, consistent with previous assessments.  \n- No signs of malicious activity; the code is a utility for warnings.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Similar evaluation; the code is for deprecation warnings, with no external or malicious behavior.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), possibly due to the use of decorators, but still standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, reflecting that the code only issues warnings and does not perform any harmful actions.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (or possibly 0, but given the initial reports, 0.1 is acceptable for minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility for deprecation warnings with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates, I would set all three scores to zero, emphasizing the benign nature of this code.",
