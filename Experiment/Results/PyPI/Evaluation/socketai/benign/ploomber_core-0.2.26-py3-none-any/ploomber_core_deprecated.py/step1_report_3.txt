{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions for managing deprecation warnings, renaming, and default value changes for parameters, functions, and methods, primarily to inform users about deprecated features in a software library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as old_value, value_passed, value, old_default, new_default, and custom_message.",
  "sinks": "Warnings generated via the warnings.warn() function, which output messages to the user; no direct untrusted data handling or external data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate warning messages; these messages are then emitted via warnings.warn(), which is a controlled output mechanism. No external data or network flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The code contains standard decorator and warning usage. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for managing deprecation, renaming, and default change warnings, which use the warnings module to inform users about deprecated features. The functions rely on input parameters and generate warning messages accordingly, with no external data or network activity. The code structure is clear, well-organized, and follows standard practices without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of deprecation warning utilities, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It only manages user notifications about deprecated features without executing any harmful actions or external communications.",
