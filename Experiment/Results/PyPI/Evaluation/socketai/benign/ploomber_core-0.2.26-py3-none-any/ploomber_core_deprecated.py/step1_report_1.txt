{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions for issuing deprecation warnings for parameters, functions, and methods within a Python package, likely to help manage API changes and inform users about upcoming removals or modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads string parameters (e.g., version info, parameter names and values), and function/method names via __name__ and __class__.__name__.",
  "sinks": "The code issues warnings via the warnings.warn() function, which can output messages to the user; no untrusted data is being written to files, databases, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data (version info, parameter states, function/method names) flows into conditional checks and warning messages, which are then emitted via warnings.warn().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The warnings are standard deprecation notices, with no unusual language features or obfuscation. The code uses standard Python decorators and warnings module without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines utility functions for deprecation warnings, with parameters controlling the messages. All data used in warnings are string inputs or function/method identifiers; no dynamic code execution or unsafe evaluation is present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The functions perform straightforward checks and issue warnings accordingly. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation techniques are used. Overall, the code appears to be standard deprecation handling logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of deprecation warning utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for managing API evolution in a Python package.",
