  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report, confirm the presence or absence of issues, evaluate the reasoning, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is purely utility functions for deprecation warnings.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is minimal (0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score (>0.5):** Not applicable; the code is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is straightforward deprecation warning utilities.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No, reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, matching the benign analysis.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** Not needed.\n- **Conclusion:** Properly assessed as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code only issues warnings about deprecated features.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No; reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code solely issues warnings, no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is utility functions for deprecation warnings.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No; reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; I agree with a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (~0.0 to 0.1) is appropriate; the reports’ scores of 0 or 0.1 are reasonable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0–0.1 (I would set it at 0.0, considering no vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured deprecation utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The reports’ evaluations are accurate and justified.",
