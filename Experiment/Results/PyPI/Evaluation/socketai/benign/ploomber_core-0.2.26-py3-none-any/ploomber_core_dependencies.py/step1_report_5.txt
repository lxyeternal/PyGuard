{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions to enforce the presence of required Python packages before executing certain functions, ensuring dependencies are met.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package names from input parameters and uses importlib.util.find_spec() to check for installed packages.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the raising of ModuleNotFoundError with a constructed message if required packages are missing.",
  "flows": "Input package names → check_installed() performs importlib.util.find_spec() → raises ModuleNotFoundError if missing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code relies on standard library functions and straightforward string handling. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines decorators and helper functions for dependency management, explicitly checking for package presence. It constructs error messages and raises exceptions if dependencies are missing. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leaks. The code operates solely on package verification, with no network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a dependency check utility that enforces package requirements before function execution. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility for dependency management.",
