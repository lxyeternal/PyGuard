  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides a decorator `requires` to enforce package dependencies.\n- Uses `importlib.util.find_spec()` to check if packages are installed.\n- Raises `ModuleNotFoundError` with a detailed message if dependencies are missing.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code detected.\n- Functionality is standard for dependency management.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms straightforward dependency check.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1; confirms standard dependency validation.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusions; dependency check with no malicious intent.\n- No anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with prior assessments.\n- No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but no actual malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or malware detected.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (possibly conservative)\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any signs of malware?**  \n  No. All reports confirm the code is a standard dependency checker, with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Is there any obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear, straightforward, and uses common Python patterns.\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is correct. The overall risk scores are also 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Any assumptions or questionable claims?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as dependency management without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1, but given no actual vulnerabilities, 0 is justified)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard dependency validation utility, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, standard, and well-understood.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, especially the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and keep the risk at 0.",
