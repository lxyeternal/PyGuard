{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions to verify the presence of required Python packages before executing certain functions, raising errors if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec() is used to check for package availability; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present; no data leaks or system effects detected.",
  "flows": "The main flow checks for package existence via find_spec() before executing decorated functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; the code performs standard dependency checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'requires' that wraps a function with a check for required packages. The 'check_installed' function uses importlib.util.find_spec() to verify package availability, raising ModuleNotFoundError with a descriptive message if packages are missing. The helper '_make_requires_error_message' constructs an error message with package names and optional extra info. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, primarily for dependency management. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency check utility for Python packages, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply verifies package presence and raises informative errors if dependencies are missing.",
