{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions to check if specified Python packages are installed, raising informative errors if not.",
  "sources": "The code reads package names from function parameters and inspects installed modules using importlib.util.find_spec.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises ModuleNotFoundError with detailed messages; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input: package names from parameters; check_installed uses importlib to verify presence; errors are raised if packages are missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard package import checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'requires' that wraps functions to ensure dependencies are installed before execution. It uses importlib to verify the presence of specified packages. The function '_make_requires_error_message' constructs an error message with package names if missing. There is no evidence of data leaks, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. All operations are typical for dependency checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dependency check utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates only to verify package availability and inform users accordingly.",
