  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides a decorator `requires` to enforce package dependencies.\n- Uses `importlib.util.find_spec()` to check if packages are installed.\n- Raises `ModuleNotFoundError` with detailed messages if dependencies are missing.\n- No code obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks are evident.\n- Functions are straightforward, with standard dependency validation logic.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n- All conclude that the code is a standard dependency check utility.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n- The logic is clear, using `importlib` to verify package presence.\n- No external data sinks, network activity, or code injection observed.\n- The confidence level is 1, and the malware score is 0.\n- The security risk is minimal, primarily related to dependency management.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusion: dependency validation utility.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to conservative assumption about error handling.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n- No suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code performs dependency checks via `importlib.util.find_spec()`, raising errors if packages are missing. No issues or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate. They recognize the code's purpose and confirm its benign nature.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given no malicious code is present.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n  - **Security risk:** 0 or very close to it, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. The code is a dependency checker, which is inherently low risk.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The code does not assume anything dangerous; it performs explicit package checks.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the code?**  \n  Yes. All scores align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign dependency validation utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, standard, and has no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate. I agree with the assessments and see no need for adjustments.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Keep the overall security risk at 0.  \n- The code is a good example of dependency validation with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
