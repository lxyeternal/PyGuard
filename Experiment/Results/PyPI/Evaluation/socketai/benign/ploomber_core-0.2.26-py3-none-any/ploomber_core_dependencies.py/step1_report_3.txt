{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators and functions to check if required Python packages are installed before executing certain functions, raising errors if missing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input indirectly through importlib.util.find_spec to check for package availability.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure actions; primarily performs package existence checks.",
  "flows": "The source (package name input) flows into importlib.util.find_spec, and based on the check, may raise an error with a constructed message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs standard package dependency checking. No obfuscated language features or suspicious dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'requires' that wraps functions to verify presence of specified packages using 'check_installed'. The 'check_installed' function checks for package presence via 'importlib.util.find_spec'. If packages are missing, it constructs an error message with '_make_requires_error_message' and raises ModuleNotFoundError. The logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent. No data leakage, code injection, or suspicious network activity is present. The code's purpose is dependency validation, which is a common pattern in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency check utility without malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package existence verification before function execution, raising informative errors if dependencies are missing. No suspicious or malicious actions are detected.",
