{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators and functions to check for the presence of required Python packages before executing a function, raising informative errors if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec() to check for package presence",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; mainly raising exceptions with constructed error messages",
  "flows": "The check_installed function uses importlib to inspect package availability; errors are raised if missing, which halts execution",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs dependency checks only. No obfuscated language features or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'requires' that wraps a function with dependency checks. The 'check_installed' function inspects whether specified packages are importable using importlib.util.find_spec(). If missing, it constructs a detailed error message with optional extra messages. The functions do not execute untrusted code, write to external systems, or include hidden behaviors. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward and intended for dependency validation, a common pattern in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency checker with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It only raises ModuleNotFoundError with helpful messages when dependencies are missing. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
