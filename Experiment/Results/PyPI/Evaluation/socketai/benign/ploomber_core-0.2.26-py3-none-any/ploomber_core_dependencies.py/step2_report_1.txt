  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a dependency checker using importlib.util.find_spec.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are claimed or detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n- The main action is raising ModuleNotFoundError with detailed messages if dependencies are missing.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\nNow, let's examine each report individually:\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Accurate; confirms no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; no anomalies or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same as above; dependency check with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; straightforward dependency verification.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but the reasoning is consistent: no malicious behavior, just dependency checks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score is acceptable, given the minimal potential for misinterpretation, but it's still very low and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable considering the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score can be 0 or very marginally above 0, as in report 5, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard dependency check utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to 0, e.g., 0.01), since no security issues are present.\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and confirms the code's benign nature.",
