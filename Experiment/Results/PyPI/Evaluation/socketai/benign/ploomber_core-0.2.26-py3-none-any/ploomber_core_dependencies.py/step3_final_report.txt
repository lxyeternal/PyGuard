  "purpose": "A dependency checker decorator and functions to verify required Python packages are installed, raising detailed errors if missing.",
  "sources": "importlib.util.find_spec() calls to check package presence",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data handling",
  "flows": "Source: package name checks via find_spec(); Sink: raising ModuleNotFoundError if missing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency verification with no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator 'requires' that wraps functions to verify specified packages are installed using importlib.util.find_spec(). If packages are missing, it raises a detailed ModuleNotFoundError with a custom message. The code is simple, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It performs standard dependency checks, and no external data or network activity is involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency validation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
