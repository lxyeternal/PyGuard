  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the consistency of their findings, scores, and conclusions.\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The original code provided is exactly this: `__version__ = \"0.2.26\"`.\n   - No additional code, logic, input/output, or data processing is present.\n   - Therefore, **all reports are accurate** in stating that the code is benign and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - No errors are apparent; each report correctly identifies the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and well-supported by the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1` (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is purely a version string assignment, this is appropriate.\n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious patterns.\n   - No challenge here.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is harmless.\n   - No false claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nGiven the nature of the code, I would **agree with the current scores**.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a trivial version string assignment with no security implications. No further action or concern is warranted.",
