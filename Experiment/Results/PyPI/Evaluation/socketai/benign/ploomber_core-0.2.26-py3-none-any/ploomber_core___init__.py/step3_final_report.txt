  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ for package identification.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; simple assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a direct assignment of a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No input sources, data flows, or external communications are involved. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and full confidence in this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
