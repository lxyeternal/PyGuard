  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, simply defining a version string; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting __version__ to '0.2.26'. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or malicious constructs. The version string appears standard for a Python package's version identifier. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and typical of a package's version declaration. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
