  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is simply a version string assignment (`__version__ = \"0.2.26\"`).\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, external communications, or logic beyond this assignment.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **No corrections needed here.**\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1` (full confidence)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - **No adjustments necessary.**\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only a version string assignment, the risk should be minimal.\n   - All reports correctly assign a `securityRisk` of 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious behavior is indicated.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or contain obfuscated/malicious patterns.\n   - **Malware score of 0 is appropriate.**\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on observable code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n   - **No issues here.**\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - **No discrepancies noted.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard version string assignment, a common practice in software packaging. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary. The code presents no security risk or malware potential.",
