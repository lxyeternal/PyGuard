  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their findings, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- They correctly identify that there are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all cases, which aligns with the simplicity of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports accurately identify that the code only assigns a version string and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flawed reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound and consistent across all reports. They correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Given the benign nature, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is purely a version string assignment, there's no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**All reports are consistent and accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No changes needed.",
