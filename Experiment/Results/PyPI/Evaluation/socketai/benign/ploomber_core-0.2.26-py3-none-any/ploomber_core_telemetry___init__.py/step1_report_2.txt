  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that exports the Telemetry class for use elsewhere, likely for telemetry or analytics purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Telemetry from an external package (ploomber_core.telemetry.telemetry).",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or output are present.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to the import statement and exporting the Telemetry class; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Telemetry from an external package and defines __all__ to specify its public interface. There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or potential data leaks. The code is straightforward and follows standard Python module conventions. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard, benign import and export statement.",
