  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; code only imports a class and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines __all__, serving as an interface or public API. There are no data input sources, no processing, and no data output or transmission. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple module export with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely exposes the Telemetry class for use elsewhere.",
