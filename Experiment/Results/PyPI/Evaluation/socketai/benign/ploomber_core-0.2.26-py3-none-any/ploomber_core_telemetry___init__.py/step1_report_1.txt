  "purpose": "The code imports the Telemetry class from a specific module and exposes it for external use via __all__.",

  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows to sinks or other operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and straightforward. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a class and defines an __all__ variable to specify exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely serves as an interface to expose the Telemetry class. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
