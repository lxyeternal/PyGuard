  "purpose": "This code imports the Telemetry class from the ploomber_core.telemetry.telemetry module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ploomber_core.telemetry.telemetry",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import of Telemetry class; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only importing a class and exposing it. No data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The Telemetry class's internal behavior is unknown, but this snippet itself does not perform any malicious or risky actions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that re-exports a class without any malicious intent or security risks. The current assessment scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
