  "purpose": "Re-exports the Telemetry class from the ploomber_core.telemetry.telemetry module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from an external module (ploomber_core.telemetry.telemetry).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import flow: code imports Telemetry class, no data flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines an __all__ attribute for module exports. No data processing, user input handling, or external network interactions are present. No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The import path appears standard for a Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal module that re-exports a class without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to serve as an interface or proxy for the Telemetry class, with no security risks detected.",
