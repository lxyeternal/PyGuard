  "purpose": "Utility module for custom exception classes, message formatting, and error handling with optional CLI support, primarily enhancing error messages with community links.",
  "sources": "Exception objects, optional 'click' modules, environment variables for CLI output",
  "sinks": "Formatted error messages displayed via 'echo' or 'print', exception arguments modified to include community links",
  "flows": "Exception creation -> message formatting -> message augmentation with community links -> display via CLI or print",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows; static community link included in messages",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, focusing on exception handling and user messaging. It conditionally imports 'click' for CLI support, with fallbacks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. Exception classes extend standard exceptions, adding community links. The decorator modifies exception messages for user guidance. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The community link is a benign static URL. The code's purpose is utility-focused, with safe practices and proper fallback handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for exception handling and messaging, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk score approximately 0.1 (due to community links, which are harmless). Overall, it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
