{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes, utility functions, and a decorator for error handling and messaging in a Python package, with support for CLI and community link references.",
  "sources": "Input sources include exception objects and optional dependencies (click module). Data flows through exception handling, decorator wrapping, and message formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the `echo()` function (if click is available) which outputs messages to stderr or stdout, and `print()` for fallback. These could display exception messages, but do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are formatted and passed to echo or print, with exception chaining handled. The decorator modifies exceptions with community links before raising them.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of optional dependencies with fallback logic is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Exception handling and message formatting are conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages custom exceptions and error messaging with community links, supporting CLI and non-CLI environments. It safely handles exceptions, formats messages, and optionally outputs them via click or print. The decorator wraps functions to enhance error messages but does not execute untrusted code or perform risky operations. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception handling and messaging utility with community links. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with fallback mechanisms for optional dependencies, and does not perform unsafe operations.",
