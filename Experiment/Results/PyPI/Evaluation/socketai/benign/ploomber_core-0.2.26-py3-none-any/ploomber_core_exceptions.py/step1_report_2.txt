{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom exception handling, error message formatting, and optional CLI support for a Python package, aiming to improve error reporting and user assistance.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include exception objects and external modules (click, if available). No user input or external data reading is explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "Error messages are formatted and printed via echo or print statements; community link is appended to certain exceptions for user guidance.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in modify_exceptions decorator are enhanced with community links and re-raised; error messages are constructed from chained exceptions and output to stderr or console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes and decorators to improve error messaging with community support links. It conditionally imports CLI utilities, handles chained exceptions, and appends community info to error messages. The logic appears standard for enhancing user feedback, with no indications of malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed solely for exception handling and user messaging within a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. It appears to be a benign utility module focused on better error reporting and user support.",
