{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom exception classes, error handling, and utility functions for a Python project, particularly related to CLI interactions and error messaging with community links.",
  "sources": "Input data includes exception objects, string messages, and optional files for output. Data is primarily passed through function arguments and exception handling mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Error messages are formatted and displayed via click or print; exception objects are modified; no external network or file access is directly evident in this code.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised and caught; error messages are formatted, appended with community links, and displayed. Exception objects may be modified to include community links.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are evident. The code mainly manipulates exception messages and displays them; no malicious data handling or external communications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes extending standard exceptions, with added functionality to include community links in error messages. It uses conditional import for 'click' to handle CLI outputs or fallback to print. The decorator modifies exception messages to include community links, with no evident network or file-based malicious activity. There are no signs of obfuscated code, code injection, data exfiltration, or external malicious actions. The exception handling and message formatting are straightforward, with no anomalies suggesting sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for enhanced error messaging and exception handling within a CLI-based Python project. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in its current form.",
