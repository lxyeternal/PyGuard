{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom exception handling, message formatting, and decorator utilities for a Python CLI application, including community support links and conditional import of CLI dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from exception messages and decorator arguments.",
  "sinks": "Exception message construction and display functions could potentially process untrusted data, but are used internally for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Exception messages are formatted and optionally displayed via CLI or print statements; exception chaining allows message accumulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The conditional import of optional dependencies is standard. No obfuscated code, suspicious network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes that augment standard exceptions with community links and detailed message formatting. It includes a decorator to modify exception messages and attach community info. The logic is straightforward and intended for error handling and user support. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior; all features serve legitimate debugging and user assistance functions. No suspicious data flows or anomalous behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured exception handling utility with community support messaging. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to enhance error reporting and user guidance without introducing security vulnerabilities.",
