{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom exception classes, utility functions for error message formatting, and a decorator for modifying exception messages, primarily for use in CLI applications.",
  "sources": "Input sources include exception objects passed to functions and the optional import of the click library, which may influence exception handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the echo function and print statements, which output error messages to the user or terminal.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in the modify_exceptions decorator are processed to add community links and then re-raised; error message formatting functions manipulate exception data for output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard exception handling, conditional imports, and message augmentation with community links. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes that extend standard exceptions to include additional messaging features, notably appending community support links. The optional import of the click library is handled safely with try-except, and no malicious code exists in the fallback paths. The decorator modifies exception messages to include community links, which is benign. The message formatting functions build detailed exception strings, including chained causes, with no dangerous or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a well-structured error handling utility for CLI tools, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling utility designed to enhance exception messages with community support info. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall design is safe, with no signs of obfuscated or harmful code.",
