  "purpose": "The code collects anonymous usage statistics, environment info, and telemetry data for user behavior and product performance analysis, with optional opt-out.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (~/.ploomber/stats/config.yaml), environment variables, system info functions, and function call parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to posthog for telemetry data, version info requests to PyPI, and print statements for user notifications.",
  "flows": "Sources (config/env/system info) feed into telemetry functions which process and send data via posthog.capture() or print notifications, with version checks querying PyPI.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable '_PLOOMBER_TELEMETRY_DEBUG' to override API keys for debugging; standard debug practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs telemetry collection, version checking, and user notifications with configurable privacy options. No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Network activity is typical for telemetry modules. The debug API key override is a common debugging feature, not malicious. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard telemetry and configuration management module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified given the network activity for telemetry and version checks. No issues or malicious behaviors are detected.",
