  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report concludes no malicious behavior, noting the code performs benign utility functions for version parsing and git hash retrieval.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is evident.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no suspicious activity, with careful environment setup and standard subprocess usage.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The risk is minimal; no malicious intent detected. The scores seem reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is deemed safe, with standard subprocess and environment handling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) might reflect a conservative stance on subprocess execution, but still no evidence of malicious activity.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.  \n- **Justification:** No risk or malware detected; scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign utility functions with controlled subprocess calls.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign utility functions. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally very low (0.0 to 0.2). The highest (0.2) is still minimal, reflecting a cautious but justified stance given the subprocess usage.  \n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, consistent with the reports, considering the use of subprocess and environment variable handling.\n\n**Note:** The code performs standard utility functions with no malicious intent. The subprocess call is controlled and limited to version control commands, which are common and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The scores given in all reports are reasonable and justified.  \n- No changes are necessary.  \n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1**",
