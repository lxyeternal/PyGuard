  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard utility tasks, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0 due to code clarity. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the minimal inherent risk of subprocess calls with controlled environment variables."
