  "purpose": "Utility functions for version comparison, executing minimal shell commands, and retrieving git commit hashes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SYSTEMROOT, PATH, HOME), input commands (git rev-parse), version string input, fallback values.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen (executes shell commands), environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables and function arguments flows into subprocess calls and string processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. Environment variables used are standard for subprocess execution.",
  "analysis": "The code converts version strings to numeric tuples for comparison, executes a minimal shell environment to run git commands, and retrieves the current git commit hash with optional digit truncation. There is careful handling of environment variables to avoid unintended environment exposure. No obfuscated code, suspicious data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. Use of subprocess is contained and controlled. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate utility functions related to version handling and source control metadata retrieval without any malicious intent or security risks.",
