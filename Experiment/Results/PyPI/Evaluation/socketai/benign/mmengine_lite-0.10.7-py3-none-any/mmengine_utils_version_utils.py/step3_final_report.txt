  "purpose": "Utility functions for version parsing and git hash retrieval, used for version comparison and source control info.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (SYSTEMROOT, PATH, HOME) for subprocess environment setup; executes 'git rev-parse HEAD' command.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to retrieve git hash; no untrusted input directly used in command execution.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are set from os.environ; subprocess runs 'git rev-parse HEAD' with controlled environment; output decoded and truncated if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; subprocess environment is minimal and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions with minimal subprocess environment setup, avoiding untrusted input. Version parsing uses the 'packaging' library, which is standard. The subprocess call is straightforward and limited to version control commands, with environment variables carefully selected. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment variables are used safely, and the subprocess call is predictable and controlled. The code is readable, straightforward, and adheres to best practices for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard utility tasks, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0 due to code clarity. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the minimal inherent risk of subprocess calls with controlled environment variables.",
