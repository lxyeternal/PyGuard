{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function 'track_progress_rich' to execute tasks in parallel with progress tracking using the 'rich' library.",
  "sources": "Reads task data from 'tasks' parameter, function 'func' for processing, and configuration parameters like 'nproc' and 'chunksize'.",
  "sinks": "Results are collected in a list; no direct untrusted data output. No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data for system effects.",
  "flows": "Tasks are processed via multiprocessing Pool or sequentially; results flow from 'worker' outputs into 'results' list, with progress bar updates occurring during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. Use of standard multiprocessing and 'rich' library functions appears normal. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages parallel execution of tasks with progress visualization. It validates input types, manages process pool, and updates progress bar accordingly. No suspicious data flows or malicious intent detected. The structure is consistent with typical progress tracking implementations, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for parallel task processing with progress display. It does not contain any malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
