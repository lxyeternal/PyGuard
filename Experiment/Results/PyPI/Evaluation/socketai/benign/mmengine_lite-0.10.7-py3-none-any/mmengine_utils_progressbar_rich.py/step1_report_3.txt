{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility for tracking progress of parallel function execution using a progress bar, leveraging multiprocessing and the rich library for visual display.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'tasks' parameter, which can be an iterable or sized collection; the 'func' parameter is a callable function applied to each task.",
  "sinks": "Results are stored in a list 'results'; no untrusted data outputs or external data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'tasks' into the worker via 'Pool.imap_unordered' or direct iteration, and results are stored in 'results' list according to index; progress bar updates occur concurrently during processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard multiprocessing and progress visualization, with no obfuscated logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility function designed to parallelize function application with progress reporting. It includes input validation, task handling for different iterable types, and uses 'multiprocessing.Pool' for concurrency. The progress bar updates during execution are handled by 'rich', and tasks are managed with indexing to ensure correct result ordering. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are detected. The use of standard libraries and common patterns further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for parallel processing with progress tracking. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks; it is safe for use.",
