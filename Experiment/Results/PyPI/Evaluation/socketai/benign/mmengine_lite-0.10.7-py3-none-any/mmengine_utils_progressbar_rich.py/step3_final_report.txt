  "purpose": "Utility function for parallel task execution with progress visualization using multiprocessing and rich.",
  "sources": "Input tasks provided to the function, internal data flow within worker and progress bar updates.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Tasks are processed by worker, results collected and mapped back to original order, progress bar updated at each step.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of parallel processing with progress visualization, using well-known libraries. It validates inputs, manages multiprocessing pools, and updates a progress bar without external data leaks or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, with proper error handling and resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for parallel task execution with progress display. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
