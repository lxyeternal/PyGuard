{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility function for tracking the progress of parallel tasks using the 'rich' progress bar library, with support for multiprocessing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input tasks from an iterable passed as an argument to 'track_progress_rich'. It also reads task parameters such as 'task_num', 'nproc', and 'chunksize'. It does not appear to read untrusted external input or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, files, or network connections. It primarily updates a progress bar in the console and executes functions in parallel.",
  "flows": "Input tasks are processed either sequentially or via multiprocessing Pool. Results are collected in a list indexed by task order. Progress bar updates are triggered after each task execution. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a multiprocessing progress tracker using the 'rich' library. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a progress bar, wraps the provided function for multiprocessing, and manages task execution either sequentially or in parallel. It includes error handling during multiprocessing. The only external dependency is 'rich' for the progress display. No signs of malicious code or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for progress tracking with multiprocessing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is purely for user interface enhancement during parallel task execution.",
