{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to track the progress of parallel task execution using a rich progress bar in Python, supporting multiprocessing and detailed progress display.",
  "sources": "The code reads function input parameters, particularly the 'tasks' iterable, and user-provided function 'func'. It also uses multiprocessing Pool to manage task execution.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or external system access is observed.",
  "flows": "Tasks and their indices flow from the input iterable through the worker wrapper, into multiprocessing Pool, with results being assembled in order after processing. Progress updates are displayed via rich Progress components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident. The code seems standard for progress tracking and multiprocessing management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper classes for progress display, including a custom progress bar component that skips time remaining calculation initially. The core function 'track_progress_rich' validates input parameters, manages task iteration and parallel execution via multiprocessing Pool or single-threaded execution, and updates the progress bar accordingly. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious network activity, or sabotage. All data flows are internal, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks. The code's structure appears straightforward, and its operations align with standard multiprocessing and progress display patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign utility function for progress visualization during parallel execution. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. It is a well-structured, standard implementation for multiprocessing progress tracking.",
