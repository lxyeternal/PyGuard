{
  "purpose": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse version information into a tuple format.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string '__version__' and the input parameter 'version_str' in the function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data; it only processes internal variables.",
  "flows": "The version string '__version__' is passed to 'parse_version_info', which processes it into a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility for parsing version strings into a tuple containing major, minor, and micro versions, with support for 'rc' release candidates. It does not include any external data input, network activity, or system manipulation. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The parsing of version strings is standard practice, and the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for version parsing with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply processes version strings and returns structured data.",
