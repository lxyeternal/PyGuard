  "purpose": "To parse version information from a version string and return it as a tuple.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable used as input to the parse_version_info function.",
  "sinks": "The returned tuple could be used elsewhere, but no direct sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The __version__ string flows into parse_version_info, which processes and returns version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The version string parsing logic appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse it into version components, handling normal version parts and release candidates ('rc'). The function processes the string without executing untrusted code, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The code is straightforward, with no input/output vulnerabilities or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version parser with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is standard, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
