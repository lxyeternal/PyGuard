{
  "purpose": "To parse and extract version information from a version string.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the input parameter 'version_str' in the function parse_version_info.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects; the code only processes version strings locally.",
  "flows": "The code reads the version string '__version__' as a source, processes it within parse_version_info, and returns version info as a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs straightforward string parsing with no unusual behavior, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a version string and a function to parse this string into version components, including handling release candidates ('rc'). The parsing logic is simple, with no external data input, network operations, or unsafe practices. The code does not handle untrusted input dynamically; the version string is a static attribute. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version parsing with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard string operations and returns version info. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
