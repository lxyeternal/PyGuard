  "purpose": "To parse and extract version information from a version string.",
  "sources": "The variable __version__ and the input parameter version_str in parse_version_info.",
  "sinks": "The returned tuple containing version components; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input __version__ -> parse_version_info -> version_info list -> return tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs straightforward string parsing and version extraction without any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse it into major, minor, micro, and possibly release candidate components. The function splits the string, checks for digits or 'rc' indicators, and constructs a tuple. The logic is standard, with no signs of malicious intent, external data handling, or obfuscation. No secret credentials, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code appears to serve a simple version parsing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version parser with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic string manipulation to extract version components. There are no signs of malware or security issues.",
