  "purpose": "Parse a version string into its components, handling numeric parts and 'rc' suffixes.",
  "sources": "The static variable __version__ and the input parameter version_str within parse_version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only processes local variables and returns a tuple.",
  "flows": "Input version_str is split into parts, numeric parts are converted to integers, 'rc' parts are handled and appended to the list, then returned as a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard string processing and no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static version string and a simple parser function that splits the string, converts numeric parts, and handles 'rc' suffixes. It performs basic string operations without external input, network activity, or obfuscation. All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and security risk score to 0. The confidence level is high (1). There are no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The code is a utility function with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version parser with no malicious or security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
