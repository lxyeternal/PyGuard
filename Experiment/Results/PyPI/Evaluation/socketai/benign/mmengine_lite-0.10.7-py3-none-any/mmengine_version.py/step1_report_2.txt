  "purpose": "Parse version string into structured version information.",
  "sources": "Reads the hardcoded __version__ string and input parameter version_str.",
  "sinks": "Returns a tuple of parsed version information; no sinks that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Reads __version__ and version_str; processes them through parsing logic; outputs version_info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for version parsing. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse it into major, minor, micro, and possibly release candidate (rc) parts. The function splits the version string, converts numeric parts to integers, and handles 'rc' tags. The code appears to be a standard version parsing utility without any suspicious behavior. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code. The logic is simple and self-contained, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version parsing utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It processes a hardcoded version string to extract version information in a safe and straightforward manner.",
