  "purpose": "Filesystem utility functions for path validation, file/directory operations, and directory scanning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as file paths, directory paths, suffix filters, and markers.",
  "sinks": "File system calls like open(), os.makedirs(), os.symlink(), os.scandir(), and osp.exists().",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and then used in filesystem operations; no untrusted data flows into dangerous functions without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for filesystem operations with proper validation and error handling. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The functions are designed for safe filesystem interactions, and no signs of obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The overall structure and logic are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard filesystem utilities with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The code poses minimal security concerns and is safe for use.",
