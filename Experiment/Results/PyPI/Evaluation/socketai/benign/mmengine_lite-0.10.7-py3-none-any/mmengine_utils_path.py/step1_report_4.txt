  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling file paths, directories, and scanning filesystem structures.",
  "sources": "Reading file paths, directory entries, environment variables (via os.path and os modules).",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as open(), os.remove(), os.symlink(), os.makedirs(), and os.scandir() that could affect files or directories.",
  "flows": "Input paths are processed through functions like fopen, check_file_exist, and scandir; potential flows include reading file paths and performing filesystem modifications based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The functions perform standard filesystem operations. No obfuscated or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for filesystem operations such as opening files, checking existence, creating directories, symlinking, scanning directories, and locating version control roots. It properly handles inputs and raises appropriate exceptions for invalid arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data flows. All operations appear to be standard filesystem handling with no network or data exfiltration code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for filesystem management. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical operations safely, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
