{
  "purpose": "A utility module providing a Timer class for measuring elapsed time and a function for checkpoint timing, primarily used for performance profiling.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via the 'time' function from the 'time' module, and input parameters such as 'print_tmpl' and 'timer_id'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or interact with external systems; it only formats and prints timing information to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'print_tmpl', 'timer_id') influence timer behavior and output formatting; timing data is used internally for calculations and displayed via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The print statements are for performance output, not malicious data exfiltration. The global timers are standard for such utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The module defines a Timer class that measures elapsed time with start, since_start, and since_last_check methods, using system time. It includes exception handling for invalid operations. The check_time function manages a global dictionary of Timer instances, creating new ones or checking existing ones. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. All operations are standard performance measurement utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign performance profiling utility with no malicious intent. It provides timing functions and output formatting without any suspicious or harmful behavior. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
