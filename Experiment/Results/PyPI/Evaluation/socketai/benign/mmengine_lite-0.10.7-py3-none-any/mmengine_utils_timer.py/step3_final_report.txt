{
  "purpose": "A timing utility for measuring elapsed time during code execution, primarily used for profiling performance.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via the `time()` function in `start()`, `since_start()`, and `since_last_check()` methods.",
  "sinks": "Print statements in `__exit__` and `check_time()` functions output timing information to standard output.",
  "flows": "The code records start and last check times, then outputs elapsed durations; no external data flows or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured timing utility for profiling purposes. It uses standard system time functions, manages internal state with class attributes, and provides context management. The global timers dictionary facilitates repeated timing across different tasks. The print statements serve for logging timing info but do not introduce security issues. No external inputs, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The code is clear, maintainable, and aligns with common profiling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign performance profiling utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe, standard behavior.",
