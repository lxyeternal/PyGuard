  "purpose": "Define a Timer class for measuring elapsed time and a utility function to check time intervals for named timers.",
  "sources": "Reading system time via time() function; accessing global _g_timers dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Timer methods read system time; check_time function initializes or updates timers based on the timer_id key in a global dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. No malicious data exfiltration or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard timing utility class with methods to start, check elapsed time since start or last check, and context management for printing elapsed time. The global _g_timers dictionary manages multiple timers identified by strings, creating new timers if needed and returning elapsed times. The functions and classes interact solely with system time and internal data structures. No external network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward timing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected timing functions safely and cleanly.",
