{
  "purpose": "Provides a Timer class and utility functions for measuring elapsed time in code execution, primarily for performance profiling.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via time() function; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could leak data or cause harm; primarily prints timing info on __exit__.",
  "flows": "Timer methods call time() to measure intervals; check_time uses global Timer objects to track elapsed time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The use of global timers is normal for profiling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Timer class for measuring elapsed time with start, since_start, and since_last_check methods. It also defines a global timers dictionary for tracking multiple timers identified by string IDs. The check_time function initializes and updates these timers. No external input is read, nor are there any dangerous or malicious operations such as network communication, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard profiling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard performance timing utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not include any malicious features, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign profiling tool.",
