{
  "purpose": "Provide a Timer utility class for measuring elapsed time and checkpoint timing, including context management features.",
  "sources": "Imports 'time' module, accesses global dictionary '_g_timers', reads and updates timer start and last check times, accepts 'print_tmpl' parameter for output formatting.",
  "sinks": "Potentially prints timer duration in __exit__ method; uses 'print' function for output.",
  "flows": "Timer __exit__ method calls 'print' with formatted duration; 'check_time' function creates or retrieves timers and calls 'since_last_check'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code; straightforward implementation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Timer class with start, check, and context management features, and a global timer registry '_g_timers'. The Timer class uses standard time functions and allows timing code blocks. The 'check_time' function initializes or retrieves timers and reports elapsed times. The print statements are controlled via an optional format string. No suspicious code behavior, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident. The code appears to be a standard utility for timing and profiling, with no external data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or sabotage features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate timing utility with no signs of malicious intent. It performs standard timing and logging functions without any suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is minimal.",
