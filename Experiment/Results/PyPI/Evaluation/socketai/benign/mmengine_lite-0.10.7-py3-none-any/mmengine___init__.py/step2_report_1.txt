  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward module imports with no data flows, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard and benign. The confidence is high (1). No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard import statements, no data handling, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is justified. The confidence is high (1). No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard imports with no malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or data handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The confidence is high (1). No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Wildcard imports (*) are used, which can obscure what is imported but are common in package `__init__.py` files. No malicious behavior observed.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, confidence = 0.9.  \n- **Analysis:** The report notes that wildcard imports can obscure content but are typical in such contexts. The security risk score of 0.1 seems to reflect this minor concern.  \n- **Assessment:** Given the benign nature of the code and the standard practice, the security risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.05, as wildcard imports alone are not inherently risky, especially in package init files. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with a note on wildcard imports and no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the minor security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable but could be slightly reduced to 0.05 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Adjustments:\n- **Obfuscated:** Remains at 0 across all reports.\n- **Malware:** Remains at 0 across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** For reports mentioning wildcard imports, reduce from 0.1 to 0.05 to reflect the low but acknowledged concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Approximately 0.05, considering the minor concern about wildcard imports, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard module import setup, typical for package initialization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The minor security concern about wildcard imports does not constitute a significant risk, and the current scores are appropriate with slight adjustments as noted.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Adjust security risk scores for reports mentioning wildcard imports from 0.1 to 0.05 for consistency.",
