  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is just module imports and version info, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with emphasis on the absence of dynamic code or data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the use of wildcard imports (*) from local modules, which is common in `__init__.py` files, and considers this a potential concern but ultimately benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The presence of wildcard imports can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious code if present. However, in the context of a package init file, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects this understanding.\n- **Justification for score:** Given the benign context and lack of actual malicious activity, a small security risk score is reasonable. Malware score remains 0.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are acceptable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with a note on wildcard imports and standard package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning applies. Wildcard imports are common but can obscure contents; nonetheless, no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero across all reports, correct given the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1) in reports mentioning wildcard imports, which is reasonable. No higher risk is justified given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.05–0.1 (considering the wildcard import comment, but overall very low risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is standard package initialization code with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**No adjustments are necessary.**",
