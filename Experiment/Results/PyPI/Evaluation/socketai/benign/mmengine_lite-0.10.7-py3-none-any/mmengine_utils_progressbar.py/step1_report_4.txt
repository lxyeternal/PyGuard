{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for displaying and tracking progress bars during task execution, including sequential and parallel processing, primarily for use in machine learning or data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments such as task sequences, task counts, and optional initializers for process pools. Uses sys.stdout or custom file objects for output.",
  "sinks": "Writes progress and status messages to output streams, such as sys.stdout or custom files. No data is written to external locations or networks.",
  "flows": "Progress updates flow from task execution loops to the progress bar output, with no external data flow or untrusted data transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward control flow. No obfuscation or hidden code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of progress tracking utilities, including both sequential and parallel task progress updates. It makes use of standard Python libraries and practices. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident; all data handling appears to be for user-facing progress reporting. No external network access or data exfiltration methods are present. The code handles user input and task data safely, with proper type checks. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for progress visualization in Python workflows. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe for use in production environments.",
