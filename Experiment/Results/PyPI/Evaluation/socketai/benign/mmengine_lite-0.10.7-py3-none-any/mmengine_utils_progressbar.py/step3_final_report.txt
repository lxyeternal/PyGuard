{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for progress tracking and multiprocessing task management, providing visual progress bars and parallel task execution.",
  "sources": "Reads task data from sequences or iterables, and function outputs; outputs progress information to stdout or specified file streams.",
  "sinks": "Outputs progress updates to stdout or user-specified streams; no external data leaks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Source data (task sequences) processed by functions, with progress information flowing to output streams; no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard library usage and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard progress bar and multiprocessing utilities with no signs of malicious behavior. It reads task data, applies functions, and outputs progress info without external communication or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code's design is typical for such utilities, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intents are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for progress visualization and parallel task management. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
