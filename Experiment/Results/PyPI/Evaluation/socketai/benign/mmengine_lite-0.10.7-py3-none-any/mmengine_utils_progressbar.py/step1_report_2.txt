{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for displaying progress bars and tracking task execution, including serial and parallel processing with progress monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from provided task sequences, iterates over tasks in various functions, and reads system terminal size.",
  "sinks": "Outputs progress information and task results to standard output or specified file; no untrusted data sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input data (tasks) flows into functions like track_progress, track_parallel_progress, and track_iter_progress, which process tasks and output progress; no data flows into insecure or malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility classes and functions for progress monitoring in Python. It uses standard modules such as sys, collections, multiprocessing, and shutil, with no signs of malicious behavior. Input data flows from user-provided task sequences, and output is limited to progress display. There are no backdoors, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears legitimate and intended solely for progress tracking and parallel task management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of progress bar utilities and parallel task tracking, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely handles task progress display and multiprocessing setup without performing any harmful operations.",
