  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.call with shell=True in _check_executable; dynamic attribute access; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for importing modules, casting iterables, sequence checks, decorators, and object retrieval. The main security concern is the use of subprocess.call with shell=True in _check_executable, which could be exploited if input commands are untrusted. Dynamic import and attribute access are standard but should be used cautiously with untrusted strings. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no obfuscation. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear. The risk score is around 0.2-0.3, primarily due to subprocess usage, which should be controlled or sanitized in practice. Overall, the code is benign, serving as utility functions with minimal security risk, provided inputs are sanitized when used with subprocess or dynamic attribute access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions with no malicious behavior. The primary security consideration is cautious use of subprocess with shell=True, which could pose a risk if inputs are untrusted. Scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2-0.3, reflecting minor concerns but no malicious intent.",
