  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward utility index module, importing various helper functions and classes, and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is accurate. The code is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a collection of utility functions, with no external input or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identified as a benign utility module.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—utility functions, no external data handling, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, an index module organizing utility functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely import and export statements for utility functions, with no external or untrusted data involved.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard utility module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores Consistency:** The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all set to 0 across reports, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present in the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Note:** Given the code's role as an import/export index for utility functions, these scores are appropriate. If future code were to include dynamic execution, external data handling, or network operations, these scores would need reevaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
