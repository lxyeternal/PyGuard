  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a utility module that imports and exposes functions/classes without any malicious behavior.\n- **Issues:** No issues found; the code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly states that the code is a collection of utility functions with no external data handling or malicious logic.\n- **Issues:** No issues detected; the code is purely organizational.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a standard utility module, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Issues:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward utility module, no malicious logic.\n- **Issues:** No concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Valid.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Issues:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a utility module mainly importing and exposing functions/classes.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are 0, which is justified.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code is benign, standard utility code with no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
