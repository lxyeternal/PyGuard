{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an index module that imports various utility functions and classes from local modules and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module imports and the __all__ list; no external input or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data handling that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows are limited to internal imports and exports; no source-to-sink data flows exist that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility index that imports functions and classes from various local modules and defines an __all__ list for export. It does not process external data, execute commands, or perform network operations. The structure is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
