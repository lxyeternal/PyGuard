  "purpose": "Unit testing for ICU library's character property mapping functions, specifically testing East Asian Width properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Unicode code points of characters to perform assertions during tests.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; only internal function calls and assertions.",
  "flows": "Input (character code points) -> ICU library functions (getIntPropertyMap, get, getRange) -> assertions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the ICU library, performs version check, and runs unit tests to validate character property mappings. It uses standard testing patterns and ICU functions for Unicode properties. There are no network calls, data leaks, or system modifications. The code appears to be straightforward test code aimed at verifying ICU functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script for ICU character properties with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs internal assertions on character properties without any suspicious behavior.",
