{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unittests for the ICU (International Components for Unicode) library, specifically testing character property mappings related to East Asian Width classifications.",
  "sources": "Reads the ICU version and character code points (via ord() calls).",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code performs read-only operations and assertions without writing data or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "Input (character code points) is retrieved and used as arguments to ICU library methods; no untrusted data flow to sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports ICU functions, performs version checking, and runs tests that query character property maps. It compares expected values for specific characters, including Unicode code points. All operations are read-only, with no external network, file, or environment variable manipulation. The code appears to be standard test code with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unittests suite verifying Unicode character properties via ICU. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
