  "sources": "import statements for sys, os, unittest, and ICU library",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data or untrusted input is transmitted or processed in a dangerous way",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs formatting and version checks, no untrusted data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and ICU, defines a unit test class with setup and test methods, performs version-based skipping, and formats a string using ICU's SimpleFormatter. No untrusted data handling, no network operations, and no malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for ICU's string formatter, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
