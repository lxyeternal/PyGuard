  "purpose": "Unit test for ICU's SimpleFormatter formatting a static string template with fixed inputs.",
  "sources": "Static strings used in formatter initialization and formatting operation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Static strings flow from formatter creation to formatting operation; no external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses static data, and performs version check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ICU, performs a version check, creates a SimpleFormatter with a static pattern, and formats it with fixed strings. No external input, network activity, or secrets are involved. The use of ICU's formatter with static strings is safe. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is a benign unit test intended for ICU functionality verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, standard ICU string formatting unit test with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
