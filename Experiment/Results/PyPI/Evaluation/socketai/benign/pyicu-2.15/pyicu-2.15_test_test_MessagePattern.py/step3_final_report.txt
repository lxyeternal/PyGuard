  "purpose": "Unit tests for ICU MessagePattern parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals within test methods, ICU library functions used for pattern parsing.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "Static input strings parsed by ICU MessagePattern methods; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward test suite with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static unit tests for ICU's MessagePattern class, using fixed input strings. It performs pattern parsing, counting parts, and validating expected components. No external input, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. ICU functions are used as intended. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The static nature and controlled test data indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard ICU message pattern test suite with no malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
