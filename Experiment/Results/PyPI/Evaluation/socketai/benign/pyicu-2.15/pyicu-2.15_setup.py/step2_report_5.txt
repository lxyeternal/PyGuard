  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as configuring a Python ICU extension, with sources including environment variables, subprocess calls, and filesystem operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes subprocess calls to 'icu-config' and 'pkg-config' as the main data sources influencing build configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The subprocess calls are standard for build scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, since it's a build script with minimal risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment variables and external commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies external commands as potential manipulation points, but notes no malicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** The reliance on external commands is typical but could be risky if environment variables are compromised. Still, no malicious activity is present.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, with high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still low, given potential for environment manipulation, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—configuration via environment variables and subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes potential for environment variables to influence build but no malicious code.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent; broad exception handling is noted but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (appropriate, given reliance on environment variables but no malicious activity)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with dependency detection and build configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly identified, with subprocess calls and environment variables.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No malicious code; reliance on external tools is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate, high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, typical for build scripts)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, focusing on configuration and build process.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that external commands influence build flags.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No malicious code or backdoors; standard build configuration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the script as a benign build configuration process.\n- The use of subprocess calls to 'icu-config' and 'pkg-config' is standard for such scripts.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk between 0.1 and 0.2) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, given it's a build script with external command reliance, but no actual risk)\n\n**Overall:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard build setup script with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the script. No adjustments needed.",
