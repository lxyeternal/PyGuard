  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the reasoning behind the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script configures ICU build environment, invoking 'icu-config' and 'pkg-config' via subprocess, handling environment variables, and setting build flags. No malicious code or backdoors are detected; it’s a typical build script.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The subprocess calls are standard in build scripts, and no malicious activity is evident. The low risk score aligns with this.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing configuration via environment variables and external commands. No malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The slightly higher risk score is justified given reliance on external commands, but no actual malicious activity is present. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration and setup, with broad exception handling and reliance on environment variables. No malicious code or backdoors found.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The risk score remains low; the reasoning correctly identifies potential issues with broad exception handling but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing dependency detection, configuration, and build setup. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a typical build setup for ICU dependencies, using environment variables and external commands. No malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, justified by the absence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting the inherent risks of executing external commands and reliance on environment variables. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is transparent, no obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — low, typical for build scripts that invoke external tools and depend on environment variables.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard build configuration script for a Python ICU extension. It performs dependency detection, environment configuration, and setup without any malicious intent or behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed. The overall security posture is low risk, and the code appears benign.",
