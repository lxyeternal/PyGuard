  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script configures and sets up ICU-based Python extension, primarily querying environment variables and system tools ('icu-config', 'pkg-config') for ICU version and flags. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - The subprocess calls are standard for build scripts.  \n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.  \n  - The logic is straightforward: environment variables and system commands influence build configuration.  \n  - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (benign build script)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (low, typical build process)\n\n**Conclusion:** This report's scoring seems appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing ICU version detection via environment variables and external commands, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Use of subprocess calls ('icu-config', 'pkg-config') is standard.  \n  - No suspicious code or network activity.  \n  - The script's reliance on external tools and environment variables is typical for such configuration scripts.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (still low, but slightly higher due to external command reliance)\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on configuration via environment variables and external commands, with no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No obfuscation or malicious patterns.  \n  - Use of broad try/except is noted but common in setup scripts.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (consistent with previous assessments)\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar configuration script, with reliance on environment variables and subprocess calls, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - Standard build script behavior.  \n  - No suspicious code, no network activity, no backdoors.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical build configuration script with environment variables and external commands, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  - No signs of obfuscation or malware.  \n  - The process is standard for ICU-dependent Python modules.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a standard build setup script, relying on external tools and environment variables.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the inherent risk in executing external commands and relying on environment variables, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 - 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured build configuration script for ICU integration in a Python extension. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
