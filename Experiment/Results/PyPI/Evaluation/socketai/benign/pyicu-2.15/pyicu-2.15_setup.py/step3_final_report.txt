  "purpose": "Build configuration script for a Python ICU extension, setting up environment variables, compiler flags, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ICU_VERSION, PYICU_INCLUDES, PYICU_CFLAGS, PYICU_LFLAGS, PYICU_LIBRARIES), subprocess calls ('icu-config', 'pkg-config'), filesystem (reading 'README.md', listing directory files).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess executions for configuration, printing status messages, raising exceptions on failure, setup of extension modules.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence build flags and library configurations, which then feed into the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try/except blocks that could mask errors, reliance on external system commands ('icu-config', 'pkg-config') which could be manipulated if environment is compromised, but no malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build setup script for a Python extension wrapping ICU. It uses environment variables and external commands to determine configuration flags, with exception handling to manage missing dependencies. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The subprocess calls are typical for such build scripts, and the overall structure is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration for ICU integration, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
