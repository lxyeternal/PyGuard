  "purpose": "Setup script for the goslate package, used for installing the package and defining its metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for long description; imports 'goslate' module for metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata from the 'goslate' module; reads local file for description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code simply performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function to read a local file, and uses setuptools.setup() to configure package installation. All data sources are static or local files; no dynamic or untrusted input is processed or sent externally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only reads local files and module metadata for setup purposes.",
