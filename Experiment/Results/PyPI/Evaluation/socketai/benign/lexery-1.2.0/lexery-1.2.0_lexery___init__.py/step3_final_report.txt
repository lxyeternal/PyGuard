  "purpose": "A simple regex-based lexer that tokenizes input text into tokens based on defined rules.",
  "sources": "Input text lines processed sequentially; regex patterns used for matching tokens.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal token creation and accumulation only.",
  "flows": "Input text -> regex matching in rules -> token generation -> token list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard lexer with classes for tokens, rules, and lexing process. It performs regex matches line-by-line, emitting tokens or accumulating unmatched characters. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious features. Potential resource exhaustion with large inputs is a typical lexer concern, not malicious. No suspicious patterns or external data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward lexer implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily considering resource exhaustion potential under malicious input scenarios. The reports are consistent with this assessment.",
