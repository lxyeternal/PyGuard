      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward lexer implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily considering resource exhaustion potential under malicious input scenarios. The reports are consistent with this assessment."
