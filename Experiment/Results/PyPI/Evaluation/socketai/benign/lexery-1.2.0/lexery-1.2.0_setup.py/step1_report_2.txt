{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'lexery'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description, and gathers package metadata and dependencies from hardcoded strings and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setuptools-based setup script. It reads a README file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. No dynamic or external inputs are used that could introduce malicious behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or network activities are present. The script follows common packaging conventions with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
