  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, reading a README file for long description, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no sinks present",
  "flows": "Reading static file; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and follows common packaging conventions",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, classifiers, dependencies, and package data. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. The script is static and standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no potential for malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
