{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'lexery' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description; static package and metadata definitions; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no code execution or data transmission present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only reads a file for description purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated sections, or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, reading a README file, and configuring metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The dependencies are fixed versions, and no environment variables or inputs are used at runtime. The code adheres to typical setup script conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and appears benign. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided code.",
