  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for pandas string operations with controlled dynamic method invocation. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities exists. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Minor improvements could be made to the accent removal method for clarity, but overall, the supply chain security posture is strong."
