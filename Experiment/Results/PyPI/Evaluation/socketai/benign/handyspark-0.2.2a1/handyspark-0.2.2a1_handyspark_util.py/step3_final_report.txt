  "purpose": "Utility functions for Spark DataFrames, RDDs, JVM interop, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Data read from Spark DataFrames, RDDs, JVM classes, environment variables (indirectly via JVM calls).",
  "sinks": "Data transformations within Spark, JVM method calls, exception output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames/RDDs through transformations, into JVM methods, and exception handling outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. JVM interactions are standard in Spark environments.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Spark utility functions involving data transformations, JVM interop, and exception handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The JVM calls are typical for Spark applications and do not indicate malicious intent. Exception handling with colored output is benign. The functions handle data types carefully and include validation. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common Spark utility patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of Spark utility functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The JVM interactions are standard and do not pose a security risk in themselves. The static analysis supports assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2).",
