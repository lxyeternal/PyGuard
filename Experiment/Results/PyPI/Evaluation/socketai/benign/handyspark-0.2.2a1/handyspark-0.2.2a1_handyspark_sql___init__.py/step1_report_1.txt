  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and functions from the 'handyspark' package and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'handyspark.sql.dataframe' and 'handyspark.sql.schema'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink operations such as data processing, network calls, or file writes in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Importing modules (source) and exporting specific objects via __all__ (sink-like operation).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard import/export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports and re-exports specific classes and functions from an external package 'handyspark'. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The simplicity and clarity of the code suggest it is a normal module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import and export pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply exposes selected components from the 'handyspark' package for use elsewhere.",
