{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from the 'handyspark' package and defines the module's public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'handyspark' package, specifically from 'handyspark.sql.dataframe' and 'handyspark.sql.schema'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or perform insecure actions are present. No network, file, or environment interactions are found.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to the import process and the module's namespace definition. No data processing or flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be standard module import and export definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports from a package and defines __all__ for module exports. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. It does not include any code that could execute malicious behavior. The presence of package imports is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code structures are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module import and export setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The code is straightforward and standard for Python modules that expose certain classes and functions.",
