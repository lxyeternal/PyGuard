  "purpose": "Module setup for exposing specific classes/functions from the 'handyspark' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'handyspark.sql.dataframe' and 'handyspark.sql.schema'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Importing classes/functions, then exposing them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports specific classes and functions from the 'handyspark' package and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or security issues detected. The current scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
