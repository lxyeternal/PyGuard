  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and functions from the 'handyspark' library and exposes them for public use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'handyspark.sql.dataframe' and 'handyspark.sql.schema'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leakage are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated constructs observed; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and functions from the 'handyspark' package and defines an __all__ list for export. There are no dynamic code execution, data processing, or data flow mechanisms present. It appears to be a standard module initialization snippet with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import and export module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It only exposes selected parts of the 'handyspark' library.",
