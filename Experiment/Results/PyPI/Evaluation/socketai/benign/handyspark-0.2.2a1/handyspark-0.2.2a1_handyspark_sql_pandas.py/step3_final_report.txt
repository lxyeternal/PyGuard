  "purpose": "A utility class providing pandas-like string and datetime operations on Spark DataFrames, with dynamic method invocation controlled via predefined method lists.",
  "sources": "Reads DataFrame columns and method names during attribute access; uses external 'handyspark' library for UDF generation.",
  "sinks": "Generates pandas UDFs that process DataFrame columns; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers dynamic creation of UDFs via 'HandyTransform.gen_pandas_udf' based on method names validated against a predefined list.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; dynamic method invocation is restricted to a safe list, mitigating risk.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled wrapper around pandas Series, dynamically generating UDFs for specified methods. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The dynamic invocation is limited by a predefined list, reducing potential misuse. External libraries appear legitimate. No signs of malware, data leakage, or security flaws. The dynamic method creation could pose a risk if the method list is compromised, but current implementation is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for pandas-like operations in Spark, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The controlled dynamic method invocation maintains a low security risk. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
