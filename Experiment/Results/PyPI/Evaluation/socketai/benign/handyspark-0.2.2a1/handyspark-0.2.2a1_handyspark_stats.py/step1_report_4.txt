{
  "purpose": "This code provides statistical analysis functions for Spark DataFrames, including descriptive statistics, t-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.",
  "sources": "DataFrame columns (sdf), environment variables (indirectly via Spark context), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), distribution name and parameters",
  "sinks": "Java JVM methods for statistical testing, RDDs sent to Java classes, potential data leakage if sensitive data is processed without safeguards",
  "flows": "Data from DataFrame columns flows into Java statistical classes via JVM calls, distribution name and params flow into Java distribution objects, data from DataFrame is mapped into RDDs, then into Java RDDs for testing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious network activity or file manipulation, code uses standard libraries and Java integration in Spark, no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical analysis on Spark DataFrames with standard methods, converting data to Java objects via JVM integration, then executing statistical tests. The functions use well-known open-source libraries and standard practices. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity are present. The code does handle input data and performs potentially sensitive computations, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The distribution handling and fallback logic are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. Overall, the code is legitimate statistical analysis code with proper use of libraries and JVM calls, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate statistical analysis functions for Spark DataFrames with proper use of JVM integration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activities. The code appears safe and standard in its purpose.",
