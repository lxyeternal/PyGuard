{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical testing functions for Spark DataFrames, including descriptive statistics, t-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.",
  "sources": "Reads DataFrame columns, accesses Spark JVM, and uses external distribution and statistical classes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs Java objects and results, but no data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data is extracted from DataFrames, converted to Java objects, and statistical tests are performed via JVM calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present. Distribution list includes 'F' with a space which may be a typo but not malicious. No unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical calculations and tests using well-known libraries and standard Spark JVM interactions. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or unauthorized system access. All operations are typical for statistical analysis within Spark. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No unusual code constructs or hardcoded secrets identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate statistical analysis functions for Spark DataFrames. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily interacts with Spark JVM components and performs statistical tests as intended.",
