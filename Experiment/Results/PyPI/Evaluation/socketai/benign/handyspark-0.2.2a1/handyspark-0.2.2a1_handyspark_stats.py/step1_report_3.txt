{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical analysis on Spark DataFrames, including generating summary statistics, performing t-tests, and conducting Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on specified columns.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from Spark DataFrames, specifically from columns specified in function arguments. It also reads distribution names and parameters from function inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with Java classes via PySpark, calling Java methods for statistical tests and creating Java objects based on distribution parameters. It also converts Spark RDDs to Java RDDs for testing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Spark DataFrame columns into Python functions, which then convert data into Java objects for statistical testing. Distribution parameters are passed into Java class constructors, and results are retrieved from Java test objects back into Python.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Use of standard libraries (NumPy, PySpark, Apache Commons Math) aligns with normal statistical computation workflows. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical analysis using PySpark and Java classes for calculations such as descriptive statistics, t-tests, and KS tests. It validates input columns and distribution names, handles fallbacks for unsupported distributions, and converts data into Java objects appropriately. No malicious behavior or sabotage patterns are evident. The code appears to be well-structured for legitimate statistical analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical utility module for Spark data analysis, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It primarily facilitates statistical testing via Java classes from Python. No suspicious anomalies or malicious activities are detected.",
