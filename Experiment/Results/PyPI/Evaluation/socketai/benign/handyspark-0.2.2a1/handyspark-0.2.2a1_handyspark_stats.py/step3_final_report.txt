{
  "purpose": "Provides statistical analysis functions on Spark DataFrames, including descriptive stats, t-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, utilizing Java classes for core computations.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Spark DataFrame columns, converts to pandas and Java RDDs, and interacts with JVM classes for statistical testing.",
  "sinks": "Java objects representing statistical summaries and test results; no data exfiltration or external network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Spark DataFrame columns -> pandas DataFrame -> Java objects for statistics -> test results returned to Python.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Minor typo in distribution list (' F' with space) is non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical operations using well-known Java classes within a Spark environment. It interfaces with JVM for statistical summaries, t-tests, and KS tests, with data flow involving data extraction, conversion, and Java method calls. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose and implementation are straightforward and align with typical Spark statistical utilities. No security flaws, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident. The use of default parameters and fallbacks is standard and safe. The interaction with JVM classes is legitimate and common in Spark-based analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of statistical functions in Spark, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
