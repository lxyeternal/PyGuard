{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical testing functions for Spark DataFrames, including summary statistics, t-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.",
  "sources": "DataFrame columns accessed via sdf.notHandy().select(), input parameters for distribution and column names, and RDD transformations.",
  "sinks": "Java objects created for statistical computations, Java methods invoked for statistical tests, and returning results via KolmogorovSmirnovTestResult.",
  "flows": "Data read from DataFrame columns → conversion to RDD and Java objects → Java statistical test methods invoked → results returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated code. Usage of Java classes and RDD transformations appears standard for Spark. No suspicious network calls, file access, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical tests using standard Spark and Java classes, with functions for summary statistics, t-tests, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. It validates input columns, handles distributions, and performs calculations with no evident malicious intent. No obfuscated features, suspicious data flows, or hidden operations are detected. The only concern might be reliance on Java classes for statistical tests, which is typical in Spark environments. The code appears to serve its scientific purpose with no malicious modifications or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of statistical testing functions in Spark with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses Java classes appropriately for statistical operations and handles inputs securely. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior was found.",
