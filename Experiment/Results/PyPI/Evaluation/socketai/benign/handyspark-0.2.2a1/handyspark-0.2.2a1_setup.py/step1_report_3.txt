  "flows": "Reads local file ('README.md') -> package setup metadata; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script utilizing 'setuptools'. It reads a local markdown file for the description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or other potentially malicious patterns are present. Usage of standard setup procedures indicates normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
