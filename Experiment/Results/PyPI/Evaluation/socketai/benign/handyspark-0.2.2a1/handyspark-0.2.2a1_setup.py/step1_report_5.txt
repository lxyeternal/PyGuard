  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'handyspark' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file in the 'readme' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reading file -> setup configuration; no untrusted data flow to other parts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines a function to read a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or obfuscated elements. The 'readme' function reads a local file without input sanitization but this is typical for setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
