{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' via the readme() function, which is defined but not invoked.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The readme() function is unused, which is unusual but harmless; no malicious patterns or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behaviors. The unused readme() function is a minor anomaly but does not introduce security risks. All dependencies are standard, and no secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor anomaly of an unused function does not elevate risk. The overall security risk is effectively zero, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
