{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'handyspark' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' file content in the 'readme' function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the only file operation is reading a local file for documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions, defines a function to read a README file, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. No user input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The only file operation is reading a local file. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It safely defines the package's metadata and dependencies.",
