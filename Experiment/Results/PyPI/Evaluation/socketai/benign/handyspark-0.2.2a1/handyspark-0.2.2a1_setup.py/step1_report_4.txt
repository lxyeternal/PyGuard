{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'handyspark', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file in the readme() function; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input (reading 'README.md') flows into the readme() function, but its output is not used elsewhere in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The readme() function is defined but never called or used, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines a function to read a file, which is standard in package setup scripts. The setup() function configures package metadata and dependencies without any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious behavior. The unused readme() function might indicate incomplete or boilerplate code but does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the unused readme() function, which does not affect security.",
