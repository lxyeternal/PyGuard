{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of visualization functions for data analysis and model evaluation in a Spark and pandas environment, including correlation heatmaps, scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, and ROC/PR curves.",
  "sources": "Data is read from Spark DataFrames, pandas DataFrames, and internal utility functions; no external untrusted input sources are handled.",
  "sinks": "Plots are generated locally; no external data transmission, network activity, or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Spark transformations or pandas dataframes into plotting functions; no external or untrusted data sources are involved in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of visualization routines that utilize standard libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and Spark ML. It performs data transformations, binning, and plotting without executing external commands or network calls. No obfuscation techniques or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured, readable, and aligns with typical data analysis workflows. The minimal security risk score (0.1) reflects a conservative estimate considering environment dependencies, but overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of visualization utilities for Spark and pandas dataframes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
