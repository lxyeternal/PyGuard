{
  "purpose": "The code provides various visualization functions for data analysis, including plotting correlations, scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, ROC curves, and PR curves, primarily used in data science and machine learning contexts.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from pandas DataFrames, Spark DataFrames, and external functions (e.g., get_buckets, none2zero, ensure_list) that may access data or configuration. No external untrusted sources are directly used in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations through matplotlib and seaborn, which are not sinks for untrusted data but are the endpoints for data visualization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames through transformations, plotting functions, and finally visual rendering via matplotlib. There are no untrusted data flow paths that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are detected, such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All code appears to be standard visualization routines with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple plotting functions for statistical and machine learning metrics and data distributions. It uses common libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and pyspark. There are no indications of code injection, dynamic code execution, or external network activity. The functions utilize standard data processing and visualization techniques, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The only external functions from 'handyspark.util' are assumed to be benign data utilities. Overall, the code appears to serve its intended purpose without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of visualization functions for data analysis and model evaluation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use from a security standpoint.",
