{
  "purpose": "The code provides various data visualization functions for analyzing data using matplotlib, seaborn, and PySpark, including correlation plots, scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, and ROC/PR curves.",
  "sources": "Data is read from pandas DataFrames, PySpark DataFrames, and inputs to plotting functions such as columns and model outputs; no external or untrusted input sources are explicitly handled within this code.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib and seaborn plotting functions which output visualizations; no data is sent over networks or written to files in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame transformations through plotting functions; no external or untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network activity, are present. The code is primarily visualization-oriented with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple visualization functions operating on pandas and PySpark DataFrames. It uses standard data processing and plotting techniques without any dynamic code execution or external data transmission. Functions such as 'plot_correlations', 'scatterplot', 'histogram', and 'boxplot' rely on data passed to them, with no apparent malicious manipulation. The presence of imported modules like matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and pyspark is typical for data visualization and analysis. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activities are evident. The functions perform expected operations such as plotting ROC and PR curves, histograms, and boxplots with standard parameters. The code is well-structured for visualization purposes without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data visualization functions for analysis and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It employs standard practices without obfuscated code, data exfiltration, or suspicious external interactions.",
