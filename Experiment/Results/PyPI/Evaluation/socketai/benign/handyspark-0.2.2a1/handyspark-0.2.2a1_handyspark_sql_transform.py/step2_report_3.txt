  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a utility for Spark UDFs, with correct mention of function signatures and annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that data flows into UDFs applied to DataFrames, with no evidence of malicious data leakage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The code relies on user-supplied functions, but no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes low security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable, given potential misuse if user functions are malicious but no evidence here)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as utility functions wrapping user functions into UDFs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that arbitrary user functions could be malicious if supplied.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes lack of sanitization, but no code injection or malicious payloads are present. The code itself is standard, with potential risk if misused.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fairly states the risk, with a slightly higher security risk score (0.4) reflecting potential misuse.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.4 (justified, given the potential for malicious functions)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as utility functions for Spark UDFs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flow analysis is accurate; no external data leaks or malicious behaviors.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious payloads. Recognizes that user functions could be malicious if provided.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate low malware and obfuscated scores, with a slightly elevated security risk (0.2), which is reasonable.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly summarizes the code as Spark UDF utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious behaviors.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code. Standard practices used.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid low risk, malware, and obfuscation scores.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of the code as a Spark UDF utility class.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into UDFs; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate low scores, given the utility nature of the code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting the potential misuse if user functions are malicious. Given the code's nature as a utility wrapper, these scores are reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, but with inherent risk if user functions are malicious)\n\n**Final note:** The code itself appears safe and legitimate. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of user-supplied functions, which is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is a standard Spark UDF utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
