  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for creating Spark UDFs from user functions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or embedded malware. The main security consideration is the inherent risk of executing untrusted user code, which is outside the scope of this code review. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
