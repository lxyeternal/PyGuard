{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from the 'handyspark' library and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'handyspark.extensions.evaluation' and 'handyspark.sql'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports and exports without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing classes and defining __all__ for exports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with consistent reasoning and appropriate scoring. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the lack of malicious or risky elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
