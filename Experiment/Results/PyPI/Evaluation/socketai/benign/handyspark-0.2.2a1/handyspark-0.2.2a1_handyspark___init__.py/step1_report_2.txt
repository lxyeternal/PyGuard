{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing specific classes and functions from the 'handyspark' package, likely for data processing and machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'handyspark.extensions.evaluation' and 'handyspark.sql', which load classes and functions from an external library.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only imports modules and defines __all__; no data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code is straightforward import statements and export definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from a well-known library and defines an export list. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that imports certain classes from the 'handyspark' library and exposes them via __all__. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are evident.",
