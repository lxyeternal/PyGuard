{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the 'handyspark.extensions.evaluation' and 'handyspark.sql' modules, likely for data processing and evaluation in a data analysis or machine learning context.",
  "sources": "The import statements are the primary sources of data input, importing modules and classes from external libraries.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions, as the code does not perform any data processing, output, or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules; there are no data flows, transformations, or untrusted data handling beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The imported modules are related to Spark and data evaluation, which are common in data pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'handyspark' package, which is used for big data processing. The import statements are explicit and contain no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated patterns, and no signs of malicious behavior. The __all__ declaration exports these classes for external use, indicating intended modular design. There are no visible malicious functions, network calls, or data leakage points. Since only import statements are present, the risk of malicious activity is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard import module for a data processing library and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
