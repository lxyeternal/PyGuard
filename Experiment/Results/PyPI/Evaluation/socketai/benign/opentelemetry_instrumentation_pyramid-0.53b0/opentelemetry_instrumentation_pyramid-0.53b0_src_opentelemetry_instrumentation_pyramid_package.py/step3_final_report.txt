  "purpose": "Configuration of dependencies and support flags for OpenTelemetry instrumentation.",
  "sources": "Declaration of the '_instruments' tuple and '_supports_metrics' boolean variable.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration snippet defining a dependency requirement ('pyramid >= 1.7') and a support flag set to True. It contains only static variable assignments and licensing comments, with no input/output, network activity, or executable logic. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of dynamic behavior or suspicious constructs. All signals indicate a safe, declarative configuration with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
