  "purpose": "Define instrumentation dependencies and support metrics for OpenTelemetry setup",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or written to external locations",
  "flows": "No data flow exists in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward declaration of variables",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a tuple containing a version constraint for a package and a boolean flag indicating support for metrics. It includes licensing information and licensing comments but no executable or suspicious code. There are no source or sink points, data flows, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, code injections, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration snippet related to OpenTelemetry instrumentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
