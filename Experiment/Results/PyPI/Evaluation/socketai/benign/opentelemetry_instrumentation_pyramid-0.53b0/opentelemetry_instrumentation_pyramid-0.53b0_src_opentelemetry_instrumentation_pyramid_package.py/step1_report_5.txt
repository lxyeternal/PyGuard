  "purpose": "Define instrument dependencies and metric support for OpenTelemetry integration.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; static assignments and licensing comments only.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of license comments and variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing information and simple variable assignments. The '_instruments' variable specifies a dependency requirement with no dynamic or untrusted input involved. '_supports_metrics' is a boolean flag set to True. There are no input reading, no data processing, no network communication, and no potential security concerns or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely informational and configuration-oriented with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and typical for licensing and setup purposes.",
