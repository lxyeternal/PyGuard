  "purpose": "Declare dependencies and support flags for the OpenTelemetry instrumentation package.",
  "sources": "None, the code does not read any external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None, there are no points where untrusted data is used in a way that could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists between sources and sinks as there are no data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only declaring a tuple with a dependency requirement and a boolean flag. No unusual code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module-level declaration of a dependency requirement ('pyramid >= 1.7') and a support flag. It does not include any input handling, network operations, or dynamic execution. The code appears to be a benign configuration snippet without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely specifies a dependency requirement and a feature flag, and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
