  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Input data reads (e.g., environment variables, user input), code execution points, network or file I/O (if any), external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), potentially via code logic or obfuscation layers.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (score > 0.7), minimal code with no clear purpose, inconsistent malware vs. obfuscation levels, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or hidden code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or not provided in detail; obfuscation levels vary. High obfuscation (0.7) in Report 1 suggests potential concealment but no concrete malicious activity is observed. Other reports show straightforward, benign code with low or zero obfuscation and no suspicious patterns. Scores are generally consistent with the descriptions, with low malware (0.1 or 0) and low security risk (0.2). The confidence scores reflect the certainty based on available information. No significant anomalies or malicious indicators are detected. The overall assessment indicates a low likelihood of malicious behavior, with some caution warranted for high obfuscation cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no evidence of malicious activity. High obfuscation in Report 1 warrants a slightly increased suspicion but remains low due to lack of concrete malicious indicators. Scores are consistent and justified; no adjustments are necessary.",
