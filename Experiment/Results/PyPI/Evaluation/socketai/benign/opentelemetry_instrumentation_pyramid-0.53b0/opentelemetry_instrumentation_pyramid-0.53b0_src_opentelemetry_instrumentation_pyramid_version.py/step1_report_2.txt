{
  "purpose": "The code is a license and version declaration for the OpenTelemetry project, likely part of a larger open-source library or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static license comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of license comments and version info is standard; no unusual or suspicious code constructs or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment. No dynamic code, user input, or external data sources are involved. There are no functions, network calls, or sensitive operations. It appears to be a minimal, safe component of an open-source project with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as metadata declaration for licensing and versioning. No security concerns or malware are evident.",
