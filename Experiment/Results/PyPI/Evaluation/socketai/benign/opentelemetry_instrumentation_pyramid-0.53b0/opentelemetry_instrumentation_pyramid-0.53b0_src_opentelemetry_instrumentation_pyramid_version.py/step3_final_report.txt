{
  "purpose": "This code provides licensing information and assigns a version string for the open-source package, serving as metadata and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only comments and a static variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is static with no input/output or dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single line assigning a version string to __version__. There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, or suspicious constructs. The code is typical boilerplate for open-source Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard header with licensing and version information. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
