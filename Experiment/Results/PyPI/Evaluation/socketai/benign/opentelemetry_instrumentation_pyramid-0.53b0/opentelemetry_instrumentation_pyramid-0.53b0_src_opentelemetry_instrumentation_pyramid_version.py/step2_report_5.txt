  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\nThe code is a standard header with licensing comments and a single line assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no functions, data processing, external input, or other code constructs. This is typical boilerplate for an open-source project.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is benign and contains only licensing comments and a version assignment.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code content.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports consistently conclude the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n- The license comments are standard and do not indicate any malicious behavior.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The scores are reasonable: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation techniques used)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall assessment:\nThe code is a typical open-source header with version info and licensing comments. It is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code content.",
