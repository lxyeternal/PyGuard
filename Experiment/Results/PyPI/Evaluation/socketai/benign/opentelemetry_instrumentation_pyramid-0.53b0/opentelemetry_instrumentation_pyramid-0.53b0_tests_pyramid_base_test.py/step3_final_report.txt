  "purpose": "A test suite for HTTP endpoints that simulate responses and errors for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "request.matchdict['helloid'] to determine response or exception.",
  "sinks": "Response object creation and raising HTTP exceptions based on input.",
  "flows": "Input 'helloid' from request.matchdict influences response or exception flow.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static endpoints for testing various HTTP responses and errors, using request parameters to trigger specific behaviors. No dynamic code execution, secrets, or obfuscation are present. Headers are static and do not contain sensitive data. The logic is straightforward and typical for testing environments, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing setup for HTTP responses, with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or security issues. The static headers and parameter-based response control are standard for such testing code. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
