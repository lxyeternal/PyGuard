  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing setup for HTTP responses, with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or security issues. The static headers and parameter-based response control are standard for such testing code. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
