  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple and constructs a version string from it. No inputs are read; no data leaks or external communications occur. The structure is typical for version declarations in Python packages. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version assignment with no malicious or security risk behavior.",
