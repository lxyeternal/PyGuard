  "purpose": "Defines the version number of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns and processes static version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple to VERSION and then constructs a string __version__ by joining the elements of VERSION. This is a typical pattern for version management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leaks, or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
