  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports describe the exact same code snippet: defining a `VERSION` tuple and constructing a `__version__` string from it. The code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic execution, user input, external data sources, or other suspicious behaviors.  \n**Conclusion:** The reported issues are not present in the code. The code is a standard version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a typical pattern for versioning in Python packages, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No logical errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- confidence: 1  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- malware: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, and the code is trivial, no justification exists for higher risk scores. The code is benign.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior**  \nAll reports assign malware: 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis; all are zero or minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a safe, standard pattern for versioning in Python packages.",
