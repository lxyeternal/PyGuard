  "purpose": "Define the version of the module or package.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Simple version assignment; no unusual or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a constant tuple 'VERSION' with version numbers and then constructs a string '__version__' by joining these numbers with dots. This is a common pattern for versioning in Python packages. There are no external data sources, no user input, and no dynamic execution or code injection mechanisms. The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration for a Python package and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
