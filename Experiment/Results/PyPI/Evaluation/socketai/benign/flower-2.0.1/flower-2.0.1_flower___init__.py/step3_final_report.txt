  "purpose": "Define the package version string in a standard, readable manner.",
  "sources": "Assignment of tuple to VERSION; joining tuple elements into __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Tuple VERSION is joined into __version__ without external influence or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and follows common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static tuple to VERSION and constructs a version string __version__ by joining tuple elements with dots. It involves no external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious logic. The code is minimal, clear, and a standard pattern for version declaration in Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is justified. No further action or modification is necessary.",
