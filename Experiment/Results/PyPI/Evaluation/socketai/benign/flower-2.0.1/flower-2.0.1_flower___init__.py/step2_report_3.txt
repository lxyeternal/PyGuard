  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**\n   - The code defines a tuple `VERSION = (2, 0, 1)` and then constructs a string `__version__` by joining the tuple elements with dots.\n   - This pattern is a standard way to declare version info in Python packages.\n   - No dynamic code, no user input, no external data sources, no code injection, no obfuscation.\n   - The code is static and straightforward.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard version declaration.\n   - They all assign a static tuple and create a version string without any suspicious behavior.\n   - The analysis and conclusions are consistent and accurate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and correctness of the analysis.\n\n3. **Error or Flaws in Reports:**\n   - There are no errors, flaws, or logical mistakes in these reports.\n   - The reasoning is sound, and no suspicious activity is claimed or implied.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - No report suggests any vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic execution, or data processing.\n   - No external inputs or outputs are involved.\n   - The code is a typical version declaration snippet.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted here.",
