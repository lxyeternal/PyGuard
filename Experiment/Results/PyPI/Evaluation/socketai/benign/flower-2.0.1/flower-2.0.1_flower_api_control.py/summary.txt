  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent API for managing Celery workers and tasks, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that the control functions validate all inputs thoroughly. The current scores and reasoning are appropriate, with a slight increase in risk due to potential input validation gaps. Overall, the code is safe, and the risk is minimal if proper validation is enforced within the control methods."
