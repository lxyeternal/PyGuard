{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a web-based monitoring tool for Celery clusters, handling environment variables, command-line options, and configuration files to set up the application environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLOWER_*), command-line arguments, configuration files, and options within the code.",
  "sinks": "Setting attributes on the options object, applying configurations to the settings dictionary, and starting the Flower application.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are parsed and mapped to options; options are set via setattr; configuration settings are assembled; the app is started.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. OAuth secrets are sourced from environment variables or options, not hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard practices for application startup, configuration management, and signal handling. It uses environment variables, CLI args, and config files appropriately. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, with clear control flow and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured startup script for the Flower Celery monitoring tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to configuration handling, which is standard and not inherently risky.",
