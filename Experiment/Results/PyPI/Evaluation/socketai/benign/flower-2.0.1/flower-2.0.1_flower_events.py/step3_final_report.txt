  "purpose": "Monitor Celery worker events, collect metrics via Prometheus, and persist state with shelve.",
  "sources": "EventReceiver for network events, event['hostname'], event['type'], event['uuid'], event.get('name'), event.get('runtime'), event.get('active'), event.get('eta'), event.get('started'), event.get('received')",
  "sinks": "Prometheus metrics (counters, gauges, histograms), shelve storage for state, network connection via EventReceiver",
  "flows": "Events received from network -> processed in event() -> metrics updated -> state saved periodically or on shutdown",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Celery event monitoring system, utilizing threading, periodic callbacks, and Prometheus metrics. It receives events over network, updates counters and gauges accordingly, and saves state with shelve. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code's purpose is transparent and aligns with typical monitoring tools. No errors or flaws are evident in logic or implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent monitoring utility for Celery workers, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
