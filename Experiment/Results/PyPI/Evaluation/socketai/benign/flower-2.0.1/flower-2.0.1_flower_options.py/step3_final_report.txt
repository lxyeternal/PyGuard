  "purpose": "Configuration setup for a server application, defining command-line options and security parameters.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, 'secrets.token_urlsafe' for 'cookie_secret'.",
  "sinks": "Usage of 'cookie_secret' for securing cookies, network/security options like SSL cert paths, OAuth credentials.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs flow into options; 'cookie_secret' is generated securely at import time.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious external data flows or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, secure configuration script. 'token_urlsafe' provides cryptographically strong randomness for 'cookie_secret'. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The options are typical for server setup, with no suspicious patterns or external network activity within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration setup with secure secret generation. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The overall security posture is sound.",
