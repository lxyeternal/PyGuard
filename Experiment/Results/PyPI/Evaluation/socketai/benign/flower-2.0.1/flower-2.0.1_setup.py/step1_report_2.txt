{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'flower' package, used to configure and distribute the package via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'flower/__init__.py', reads README.rst for long description, reads requirements from files in 'requirements/' directory.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or executes untrusted commands; primarily reads files and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version data from 'flower/__init__.py' -> uses in setup() -> reads description and requirements files -> uses in package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data leakage points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It extracts version info without importing the package, loads description and requirements files, and defines package metadata. All operations involve reading static files and defining package parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code follows typical packaging patterns, with no anomalies or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for the 'flower' package with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It performs standard package setup operations safely.",
