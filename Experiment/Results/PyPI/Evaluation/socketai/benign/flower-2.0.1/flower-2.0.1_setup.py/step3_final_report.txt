  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'flower' Python package, handling version extraction, requirements, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'flower/__init__.py', requirements from files in 'requirements/', and README for description.",
  "sinks": "None; static file reads with no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "File reads for version, requirements, and description; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward 'setup.py' script with static file operations, no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly assess its benign nature. No adjustments needed.",
