{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement an Inspector class for monitoring worker processes via a control interface, gathering status data asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'capp.control.inspect' method, input parameters to class methods, and environment variables accessed indirectly through external control mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include the dynamic invocation of methods on the 'inspect' object, and asynchronous callbacks which may handle untrusted responses.",
  "flows": "The code initiates inspect commands with specified methods, retrieves results, and updates internal state via callbacks, propagating responses through 'add_callback' to '_on_update'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of dynamic method calls is typical in inspection tools, not suspicious here. No obfuscated code or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Inspector class that asynchronously calls methods on a 'control.inspect' object, with the intent to gather worker status data. The use of 'partial' and 'run_in_executor' allows non-blocking calls. Results are handled via callbacks, updating internal 'workers' data. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors. The code relies on external control mechanisms and standard logging, with no evident malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a monitoring utility, executing standard inspection methods asynchronously and updating internal data structures. No malicious activity or sabotage evident. The use of dynamic method calls is typical for such inspection tools and not inherently malicious.",
