  "purpose": "Asynchronous inspection utility for monitoring worker nodes via control interface, utilizing threading and callbacks.",
  "sources": "External control interface (`capp.control.inspect`) invoked in `_inspect` method.",
  "sinks": "Responses from `inspect` methods processed in `_on_update` via callbacks, stored in `self.workers`.",
  "flows": "`_inspect` calls `inspect.method()`, results passed to `_on_update` through `add_callback`, updating internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard asynchronous patterns with `run_in_executor`, `add_callback`, and `partial`. It performs routine inspection calls and logs outcomes. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The dynamic method invocation is typical for such tools and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The control interface and callback mechanisms are standard for monitoring systems. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an asynchronous worker inspection utility. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
