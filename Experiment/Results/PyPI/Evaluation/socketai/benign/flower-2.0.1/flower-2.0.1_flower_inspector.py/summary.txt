  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an asynchronous worker inspection utility. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are justified and consistent with the analysis."
