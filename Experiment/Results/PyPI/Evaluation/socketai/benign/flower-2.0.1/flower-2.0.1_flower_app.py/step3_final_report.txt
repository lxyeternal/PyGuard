  "purpose": "Initializes and manages a Tornado web server with Celery integration, handling URL rewriting, environment setup, socket binding, and worker inspection.",
  "sources": "Environment detection code, URL handlers, socket binding functions, and server start/stop methods.",
  "sinks": "Server socket binding, event loop start, worker inspection, and environment-specific configurations.",
  "flows": "Environment detection influences asyncio policy; URL handlers are rewritten based on options; server binds to port or UNIX socket; worker inspection is triggered via inspector.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; environment-specific import is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Tornado server setup with Celery integration, managing server lifecycle, URL rewriting, and worker inspection. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. Environment detection code is benign. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common server initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard server initialization script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate given its network exposure. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The overall security posture is minimal risk.",
