  "purpose": "A minimal CLI wrapper script for executing Celery with Flower monitoring.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sys', 'celery.bin.celery', and 'flower.command'; adds Flower command to Celery; executes '_main()' via sys.exit()",
  "sinks": "Execution of '_main()' which processes command-line arguments; no external data sinks or network activity observed",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> adds Flower command -> calls sys.exit(_main()) to run CLI",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for Celery with Flower, performing standard command registration and execution. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The reliance on command-line arguments is typical for such scripts and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The absence of network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution further supports its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup for running Celery with Flower monitoring. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (0.1) assigned in the reports is appropriate, reflecting minimal potential for misuse but acknowledging typical CLI behavior.",
