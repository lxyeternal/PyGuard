{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a command-line interface for managing Celery tasks and integrates the Flower monitoring tool.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, celery.bin.celery.main, and flower.command.flower",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(_main()) executes the Celery CLI command, potentially affecting process termination based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "User runs the script, which calls main(), adding the Flower command to Celery, then executing the main Celery CLI command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of external commands is standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily acts as a wrapper to invoke Celery commands with an additional Flower monitoring command. It imports necessary modules, integrates the Flower command into Celery, and then executes the Celery CLI main function. No dynamic code execution, no network connections, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard setup code for task management and monitoring without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical CLI wrapper for Celery and Flower integration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a control interface for task orchestration and monitoring.",
