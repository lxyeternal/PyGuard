{
  "purpose": "To determine the base path of the 'spacy_wordnet' package installed on the system.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'spacy_wordnet' package's '__file__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "The source (__file__) provides the path information used to derive the package base path, which is returned by the function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No dynamic execution or external data fetching occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and a 'spacy_wordnet' package, then defines a function that returns the directory path of the package. It relies on the __file__ attribute of the package module, which is standard for such operations. The implementation appears typical and safe, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply retrieves and returns the base directory path of a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
