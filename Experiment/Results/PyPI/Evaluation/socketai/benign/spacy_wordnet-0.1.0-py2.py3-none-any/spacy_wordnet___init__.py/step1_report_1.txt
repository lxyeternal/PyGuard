{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the base path of the 'spacy_wordnet' package.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(spacy_wordnet.__file__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "The code reads the __file__ attribute of 'spacy_wordnet' to determine its directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and a package 'spacy_wordnet'. It then defines a variable that captures the directory path of the 'spacy_wordnet' package file location, which is obtained via '__file__'. The function 'get_package_basepath()' returns this directory path. The code's purpose appears to be to locate and return the installation directory of the package. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code simply retrieves package metadata, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to provide the package's installation path. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
