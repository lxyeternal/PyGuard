  "purpose": "Provide a function to retrieve the base path of the 'spacy_wordnet' package.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute of the 'spacy_wordnet' package to determine its directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only returns a package directory path.",
  "flows": "Input (__file__ attribute) -> get_package_basepath() -> return path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code simply retrieves a file path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and a third-party package 'spacy_wordnet'. It defines a variable __PACKAGE_BASE_PATH' that stores the directory path of the package by accessing '__file__' of 'spacy_wordnet'. The function get_package_basepath() returns this path. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal, clean, and serves a simple purpose of returning a directory path.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving to provide the package's base directory. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
