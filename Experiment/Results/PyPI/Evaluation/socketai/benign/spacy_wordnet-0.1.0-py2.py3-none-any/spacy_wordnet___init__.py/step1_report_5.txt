  "purpose": "The code defines a function to retrieve the base path of the 'spacy_wordnet' package installation directory.",
  "sources": "os module's dirname function applied to spacy_wordnet.__file__",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leak or execution",
  "flows": "Retrieving package path from the package's __file__ attribute",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and 'spacy_wordnet', then determines the package's base directory by accessing '__file__' attribute of the package and applying 'os.path.dirname'. It simply provides a function to return this directory path. The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted data, or include suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code or malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and harmless, intended solely to provide the package's base directory path. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
