  "purpose": "Retrieve and return the installation directory path of the spacy_wordnet package.",
  "sources": "Accessing spacy_wordnet.__file__ to determine package location.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading spacy_wordnet.__file__ and returning its directory path.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and spacy_wordnet, then defines a variable to store the directory path of the package using spacy_wordnet.__file__. It provides a function to return this path. The code is simple, standard, and performs no network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The logic is sound, and the purpose is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to retrieve the package directory path. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
