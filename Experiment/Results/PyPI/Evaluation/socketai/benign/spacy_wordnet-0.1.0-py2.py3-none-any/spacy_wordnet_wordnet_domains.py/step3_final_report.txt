{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility class for interacting with WordNet synsets, lemmas, and domain data, primarily for NLP tasks involving semantic analysis and domain filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads domain data from an external file 'wordnet_domains.txt' located in a data directory; processes spaCy tokens and synsets.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or network activity; data flows are internal and limited to file reading and in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "Token input → synset and lemma retrieval functions → domain filtering functions; no external data exfiltration or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected; reliance on external data files is standard for NLP utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward NLP utility interfacing with WordNet, loading domain data from a local file, and providing methods to retrieve synsets, lemmas, and domain information based on tokens. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The external data dependency is typical and does not imply malicious intent. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard NLP utility module for WordNet and domain data handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, low risk) are justified and appropriate.",
