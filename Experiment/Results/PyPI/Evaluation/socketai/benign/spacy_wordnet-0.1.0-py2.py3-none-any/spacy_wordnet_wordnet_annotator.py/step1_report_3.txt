{
  "purpose": "The code defines a SpaCy extension to annotate tokens with WordNet domain information using the 'spacy_wordnet' library.",
  "sources": "Imports from spaCy modules, and the __init__ method that loads WordNet domains.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external data or cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code initializes WordNet data and assigns annotations to tokens in SpaCy documents; no external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code relies on standard libraries and typical SpaCy extension mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a SpaCy pipeline component for WordNet annotation, handling compatibility for different SpaCy versions. It loads WordNet domains and assigns WordNet objects to token extensions. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate NLP enhancement purpose without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign SpaCy extension for WordNet annotation, with no indications of malware or malicious intent. It operates solely within the NLP processing pipeline, without external communication or harmful operations.",
