  "purpose": "The code defines a spaCy extension for annotating tokens with WordNet domain information, enabling linguistic annotation within NLP pipelines.",
  "sources": "Imports from spaCy modules, load_wordnet_domains(), and the __init__ method where Wordnet domains are loaded.",
  "sinks": "Token._.set() method which assigns Wordnet data to tokens; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "load_wordnet_domains() -> Token.set_extension() -> Wordnet() instantiation per token -> token._.set() to store data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward extension registration and data annotation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports NLP components and extends spaCy tokens with WordNet domain annotations. It conditionally defines a factory for spaCy 3.x and maintains compatibility with 2.x. The WordnetAnnotator class initializes by loading WordNet domains and setting a custom extension on tokens. It processes each token in a document, assigning a Wordnet object. There are no evident security issues, code injection points, or malicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be linguistic annotation enhancement, with no indication of harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension for spaCy NLP pipelines, intended for linguistic annotation with WordNet. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
