  "purpose": "The code defines a SpaCy extension for annotating tokens with WordNet domain information using the spacy_wordnet library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SpaCy tokens, language, and WordNet modules; function decorators; class constructor reading 'nlp' object; method accessing token data.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the WordnetAnnotator class and its __call__ method flow: reading tokens from docs and setting token extension data.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically loads and applies NLP components without obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. It uses standard SpaCy extension mechanisms. No suspicious data handling or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads SpaCy token and language modules, then defines a factory for creating a WordNet annotator, with compatibility for SpaCy 2.x and 3.x. It loads WordNet domains and sets token extensions for wordnet data. The implementation appears straightforward and aligns with common NLP extension practices. No external network calls, file manipulations, or code injections are observed. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. All parts are related to NLP annotation, with proper use of SpaCy APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard NLP extension for integrating WordNet domain annotation into SpaCy pipelines. No malicious intent or malicious behaviors are detected based on this code snippet.",
