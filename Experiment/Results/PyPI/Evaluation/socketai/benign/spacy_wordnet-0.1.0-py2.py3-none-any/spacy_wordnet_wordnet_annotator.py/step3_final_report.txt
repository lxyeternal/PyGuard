  "purpose": "A SpaCy extension that annotates tokens with WordNet domain information using external WordNet data.",
  "sources": "Loading WordNet domains via load_wordnet_domains() during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Token extension setting; no external data leaks or network communication.",
  "flows": "load_wordnet_domains() during setup; token._.set(Wordnet) during annotation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SpaCy extension for linguistic annotation, loading external WordNet data locally. It registers a factory for spaCy 2.x and 3.x, sets token extensions, and annotates tokens with Wordnet objects. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The external data load is a benign operation, common in NLP tools. The code's structure and purpose are transparent and consistent with benign NLP extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard NLP extension for WordNet annotation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores should reflect this, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (0).",
