  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing WordNet domain data, language mappings, and POS conversions in NLP applications.",
  "sources": "File reading operations via glob.glob() and open() for loading domain data; data input from filesystem paths.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations via open() in _persist_wordnet_domains; no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reading domain files -> processing lines -> storing in dictionaries; writing domain data to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context managers in multiple functions; no input validation or sanitization; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O for data management, with mappings for language and POS tags. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only concern is resource management due to missing context managers, which could cause file descriptor leaks but not security issues. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and intended for linguistic data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for NLP tasks. No malicious intent or security risks are present. The minor resource management issue does not elevate the security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
