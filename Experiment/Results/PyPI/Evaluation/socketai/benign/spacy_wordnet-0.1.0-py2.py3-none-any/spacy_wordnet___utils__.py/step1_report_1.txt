  "purpose": "This code provides functions for handling WordNet domains and language mappings, mainly for linguistic processing with support for multiple languages and formats.",
  "sources": "Reads data from files using glob.glob and open().",
  "sinks": "Writes data to files with open() in _persist_wordnet_domains.",
  "flows": "File reading for loading domain data; file writing for persisting domain data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context managers in _load_wordnet_domains_from_ppv and _load_wordnet_domains_from_txt; no validation or sanitization of filenames or file contents; no explicit use of untrusted user input sources, but potential risk exists if paths are influenced externally.",
  "analysis": "The code loads and saves domain data for WordNet via files, using glob and open. No user input is directly handled; the code primarily reads from and writes to files based on paths provided as arguments. The open() calls lack safety features like context managers in some functions, which is not inherently malicious but could cause resource issues if misused. There are no network operations, code injections, or obfuscated behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions for linguistic data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for linguistic data management with no evidence of malicious intent. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. Risks are limited to potential file handling issues if paths are not controlled, but there are no signs of deliberate malicious actions or sabotage.",
