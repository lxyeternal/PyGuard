{
  "purpose": "This code manages HTTP requests with retries and optional insecure certificate verification, providing a session-based interface for making various HTTP calls with error handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DOMINO_MAX_RETRIES, DOMINO_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE), input parameters (URLs, data, json), response content",
  "sinks": "Response error handling logs; potential output to console with warnings; unverified HTTPS requests if certificate verification is bypassed",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence session configuration; HTTP responses are processed, errors may be logged; error responses are parsed for HTML content",
  "anomalies": "Use of print for warnings instead of logging; optional insecure certificate verification based on environment variables; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an HTTP session with retries and optional insecure SSL verification, based on environment variables. It provides methods for HTTP verbs and robust error handling, including logging and specific exception raising. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed. The code is typical for an HTTP request manager with proper error handling and retry logic. Use of print for warnings could be considered unconventional but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard HTTP request handling utility with configurable retries and SSL verification options. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. The use of environment variables and logging aligns with good practices, and no signs of malware or security risks are present.",
