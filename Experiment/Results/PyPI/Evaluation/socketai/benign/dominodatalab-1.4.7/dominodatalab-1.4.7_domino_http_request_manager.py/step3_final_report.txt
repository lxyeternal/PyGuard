{
  "purpose": "This code manages HTTP requests with retry logic, session setup, and optional SSL verification bypass based on environment variables, primarily for making resilient HTTP calls within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DOMINO_MAX_RETRIES, DOMINO_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE), input URLs, request data, and JSON payloads.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (post, get, patch, put, delete) that send data over the network; potential data leakage if environment variables are manipulated; logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence session configuration (SSL verification and retries); request methods send data to specified URLs; error handling logs or raises exceptions based on response status.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() for warnings instead of logging; reliance on environment variables for security-sensitive configurations without validation; no input validation for URLs or data; standard request handling without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an HTTP session with retry logic, configurable via environment variables. It allows disabling SSL verification, which can be exploited if environment variables are manipulated. Error handling captures HTTP errors, logging responses or raising exceptions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The use of print() for warnings is suboptimal but not malicious. The environment variable-driven SSL bypass is a security concern but a common testing pattern. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are justified based on these observations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious HTTP request utility with configurable security settings. The primary security concern is the optional SSL verification bypass controlled via environment variables, which should be used cautiously. No malware or obfuscation detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
