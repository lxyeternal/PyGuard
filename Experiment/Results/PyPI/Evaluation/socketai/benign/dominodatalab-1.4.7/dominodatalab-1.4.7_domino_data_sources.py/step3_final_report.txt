{
  "purpose": "Handles import errors for 'domino_data.data_sources' and provides dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ for lazy loading.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'domino_data.data_sources' and the __getattr__ function that imports and accesses attributes from the module.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic __getattr__ function retrieves attributes from 'domino_data.data_sources' without executing untrusted code or external commands.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'domino_data.data_sources' -> if failed, raise error with instructions -> __getattr__ imports 'domino_data.data_sources' and returns attribute value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for lazy loading is somewhat unusual but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a module and provides a fallback error message if the import fails. It uses __getattr__ to lazily load the module and access its attributes dynamically. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The pattern is common for optional dependencies. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The error handling and dynamic attribute access are standard practices, and the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency management pattern with lazy loading and error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
