{
  "purpose": "To handle import errors gracefully and dynamically import the 'domino_data.data_sources' module when needed.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'domino_data.data_sources', and the try-except block attempting to import it.",
  "sinks": "getattr call on 'domino_data.data_sources', which accesses attributes of the module dynamically.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'domino_data.data_sources'; if import fails, raise a detailed error message; on attribute access, dynamically load the module and retrieve attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of __getattr__ for dynamic attribute access is typical for lazy loading or module proxies; no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to import 'domino_data.data_sources' and provides a fallback error message if the import fails. The __getattr__ function dynamically loads the module and retrieves attributes, which is a common pattern for lazy loading or proxies. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and the code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The presence of detailed error messages improves usability and debugging, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import handling and dynamic attribute access pattern with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a utility for graceful import failure management and lazy module loading.",
