{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import a module named 'domino_data.data_sources' and provides a fallback message if the module is not installed, including instructions for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the import error message string.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the dynamic attribute access via __getattr__, but only within the context of the imported module.",
  "flows": "The flow starts with attempting to import 'domino_data.data_sources'. If it fails, it raises an ImportError with instructions. The __getattr__ function dynamically imports 'domino_data.data_sources' if not already imported and retrieves attributes from it.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __getattr__ for dynamic attribute retrieval is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on a third-party module which is not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of 'domino_data.data_sources' module and provides user-friendly error messages with installation instructions if the module is missing. The try-except blocks handle ImportError exceptions, raising detailed messages. The __getattr__ function ensures that attributes from the module can be accessed dynamically, importing the module if necessary. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for conditional importing with user guidance. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, but the dynamic attribute access is somewhat unusual but not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign with no security risks.",
