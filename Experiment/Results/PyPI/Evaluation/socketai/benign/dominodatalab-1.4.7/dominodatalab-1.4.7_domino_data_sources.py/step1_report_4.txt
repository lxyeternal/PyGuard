{
  "purpose": "To handle import errors gracefully for the 'domino_data.data_sources' module, providing user guidance on installation.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'domino_data.data_sources' and the dynamic attribute access in '__getattr__'.",
  "sinks": "The '__getattr__' function dynamically retrieves attributes from 'domino_data.data_sources', potentially exposing its internals.",
  "flows": "On import failure, the code raises an error with instructions; in '__getattr__', it imports 'domino_data.data_sources' and retrieves attributes dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__getattr__' for dynamic attribute access; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors; error messages are clear but do not contain sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to provide a fallback for missing modules by instructing users on how to install them. The use of '__getattr__' allows dynamic attribute access to 'domino_data.data_sources'. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling. The import error handling is standard and aims to improve user experience if dependencies are missing. No external data is read, nor are any untrusted inputs processed. The overall structure is typical for managing optional dependencies.\n\nThe only notable aspect is the dynamic attribute access via '__getattr__', which is a common pattern for lazy loading or proxy behavior, not inherently malicious.\n\nOverall, there is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency import management snippet with proper error handling and dynamic attribute access. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
