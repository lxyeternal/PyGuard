{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import and dynamically access the 'domino_data.data_sources' module, providing an error message guiding users to install the package if it's missing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'domino_data.data_sources' during import and within the __getattr__ function when an attribute is accessed.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data could potentially be any attribute name passed to __getattr__, which is used to access module attributes dynamically.",
  "flows": "The code imports the module and assigns it to a local namespace, then __getattr__ attempts to fetch attributes from that module when requested. No external or untrusted data flows explicitly observed beyond attribute names.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for dynamic attribute access is typical for lazy loading; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and does not perform any data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages module import errors and provides a fallback via __getattr__ for dynamic attribute access. The import and error handling are standard, with no suspicious or malicious code present. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code's structure is clear, with no obfuscation or unusual patterns. It aims to ensure the required module is installed and accessible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, mainly focusing on error handling and dynamic module attribute access. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on this snippet.",
