  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code attempts to import `domino_data.data_sources`. If the import fails, it raises a detailed error message guiding the user to install the package.\n- It defines a `__getattr__` function that dynamically imports `domino_data.data_sources` if needed and retrieves attributes from it.\n- The pattern is a common lazy-loading or proxy pattern for optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code functions as intended: handling import errors gracefully and enabling dynamic attribute access.\n- No malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident.\n- The dynamic `__getattr__` is a typical pattern for lazy loading modules.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and handles dependencies gracefully.\n- They note the unusual use of `__getattr__` but correctly conclude it is not suspicious.\n- No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**Verdict:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.1, reflecting a very low security risk due to dependency management, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:\n- The risk and malware scores are both 0, which aligns with the analysis. There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern could be the dynamic attribute access, but it is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they analyze the code thoroughly.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware are made without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and safe.\n- The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious.\n- No additional security concerns or malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (as per reports, justified by dependency handling, not a security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
