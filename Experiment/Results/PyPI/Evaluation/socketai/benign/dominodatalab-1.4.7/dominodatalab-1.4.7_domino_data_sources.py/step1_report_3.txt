{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports a module 'domino_data.data_sources' and provides a fallback error message if the module is not installed, ensuring that import errors are user-friendly.",
  "sources": "The code reads an import attempt of 'domino_data.data_sources' during the import process, and within the __getattr__ function when accessing module attributes.",
  "sinks": "The getattr call could potentially access attributes of the 'domino_data.data_sources' module, but only if it has been successfully imported. No untrusted data flow or data leakage is evident.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'domino_data.data_sources' (source), fallback to custom error message if import fails, and in __getattr__, import module again and retrieve attribute (source-to-sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to dynamically load module attributes is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to import a specific module and handle missing dependencies gracefully by raising a descriptive error message. The __getattr__ method dynamically loads the module if accessed, which is a common pattern for lazy-loading or proxy-like behavior. No malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors is evident. No security risks or malware signs are identified; the code simply manages dependency import errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dependency management snippet with custom error handling. It does not contain malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ is a standard pattern for delayed imports, not suspicious.",
