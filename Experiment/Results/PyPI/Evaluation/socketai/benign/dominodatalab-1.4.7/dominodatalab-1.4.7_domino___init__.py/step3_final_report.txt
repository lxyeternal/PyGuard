  "purpose": "Module initialization: defines exports, imports version info and class.",
  "sources": "Import from 'domino._version' and local module '.domino'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports version string and class, then exports them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing standard imports and defining __all__. No dynamic execution, input handling, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code aligns with typical Python module setup, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a module's __init__.py. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
