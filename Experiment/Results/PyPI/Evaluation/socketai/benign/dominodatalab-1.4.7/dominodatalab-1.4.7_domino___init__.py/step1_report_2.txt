{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily for module initialization, importing version information and a class from local modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version number from 'domino._version' and potentially imports the 'Domino' class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to cause data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The version string is imported from 'domino._version' and the class 'Domino' from '.domino', but there is no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for module init files, with no unusual code, dynamic execution, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ for public API exposure, imports version info, and a class. It does not process untrusted input, execute code dynamically, or contain suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
