{
  "purpose": "Define the module exports and import version and class from other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'domino._version' and potentially dynamic module loading via __all__.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Imported __version__ from 'domino._version' (source) to usage in module context; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. The __all__ list includes standard symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up the public interface of the module by defining __all__, imports a version string from a submodule, and imports a class. All operations are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution, data input, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module setup with standard imports and export definitions. No malicious activity or security concerns are detected.",
