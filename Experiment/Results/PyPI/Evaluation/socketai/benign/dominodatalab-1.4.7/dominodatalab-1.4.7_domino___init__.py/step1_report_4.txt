{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the module exports for a package, exposing 'Domino' and '__version__'. It imports a version string and a class, likely for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from 'domino._version' to obtain the version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The version string from 'domino._version' is imported and potentially used elsewhere; the 'Domino' class is imported for export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common module export patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports by importing a version and a class. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior indicators. It appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply exposes a class and version information for external use.",
