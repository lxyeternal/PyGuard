  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence for malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard module initialization code.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of dynamic code execution, data input handling, or network activity.\n- The code imports a version string from a submodule and a class, then defines `__all__` for exports.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- None of the reports identify any actual vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code snippets are straightforward and follow common Python module practices.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is very simple, there is no basis to assume hidden malicious intent.\n- The import of version info and class is standard practice, with no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks are evident.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign module initialization snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate; no issues are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
