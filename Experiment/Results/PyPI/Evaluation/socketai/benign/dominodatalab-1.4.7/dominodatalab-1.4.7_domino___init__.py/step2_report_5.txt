  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their accuracy and implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module initialization snippet.\n- The code only performs standard imports, defines `__all__`, and imports a version string and a class.\n- No dynamic code execution, data input, network activity, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or signs of malicious behavior are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign and standard. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is standard and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Are any score adjustments needed?**  \nNo. The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and security risk justification:\n- Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The code does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform any operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n- The only imported data is a version string, which is safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made that are not supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's benign, straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard module setup with no security concerns. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, clear, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
