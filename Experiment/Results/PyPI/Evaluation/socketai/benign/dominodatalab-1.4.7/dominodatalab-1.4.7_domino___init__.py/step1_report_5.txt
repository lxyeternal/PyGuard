  "purpose": "The code defines module exports and imports the package version and a class from another module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from 'domino._version' and imports the 'Domino' class from '.domino'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; simply importing modules and setting exports.",
  "flows": "The version string and 'Domino' class are imported without processing untrusted data, so no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes module exports with '__all__', imports the package version from a submodule, and imports a class. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be standard module setup without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization snippet, importing version information and a class, and setting exports. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
