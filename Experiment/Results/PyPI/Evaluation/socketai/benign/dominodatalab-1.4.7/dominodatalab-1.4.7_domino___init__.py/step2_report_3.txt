  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a minimal module initialization snippet, importing a version string from 'domino._version' and a class 'Domino' from a local module, then defining `__all__`.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, data flows from untrusted sources, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or I/O operations.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly defines module exports, imports version info, and a class. No issues or errors are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports identify any malicious intent or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are identified; the code is purely structural and declarative.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of the scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All 0, indicating no security concerns.\n\n**Given the evidence, these scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **The code does not contain any issues or suspicious activity.**\n- **The reports are accurate in their reasoning and scoring.**\n- **No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**In conclusion, this is a standard, benign module initialization code with no security concerns.**",
