  "purpose": "Define various enumeration classes for configuration or categorization purposes within a larger system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present; no untrusted data is handled or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present as there is only static enum class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard enum definitions; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions, which are used for type-safe constants. No external input handling, data processing, or side-effect-producing operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious logic. The structure is clear and standard for Python enum usage. Since the code is static definitions only, no malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static enum definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to serve purely as configuration or constant definitions.",
