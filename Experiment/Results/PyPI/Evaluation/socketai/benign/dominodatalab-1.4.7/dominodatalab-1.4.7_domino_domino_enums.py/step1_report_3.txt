  "purpose": "Define various enumeration classes for budget labels, types, billing tag settings, and project visibility options.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and string assignments within the classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no input/output handling exists.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard enum definitions; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class declarations, assigning string values to enumeration members. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The structure is typical and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward and solely serves as constants definitions for a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of enum definitions intended for categorization within an application. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. Overall, it is safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
