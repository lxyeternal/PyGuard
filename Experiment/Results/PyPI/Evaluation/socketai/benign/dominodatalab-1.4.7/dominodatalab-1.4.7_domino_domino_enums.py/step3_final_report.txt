  "purpose": "Defines various enumerations for categorization and configuration purposes in a system.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class definitions with string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static enum declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard enum patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions assigning string values to constants. There are no input/output operations, data processing, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is static and intended for configuration or categorization. Given the absence of dynamic behavior, malicious payloads, or security-sensitive operations, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of enum definitions used for configuration purposes. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The current scoring and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
