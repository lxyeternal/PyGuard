  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the findings, scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple enum class definitions used for categorization/configuration.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, a security risk of 0, and high confidence (mostly 1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code snippet, which defines enums for labels, types, modes, and visibility settings.\n- **Presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None. The code is purely static, declarative, and standard.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Logical reasoning:** The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is static enum definitions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scoring consistency:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Potential overconfidence:** The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n### Specific Observations:\n- The reports do not mention any potential for misuse or indirect security issues, which is appropriate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, which is correct.\n- The code does not handle data, so no data flow or source-to-sink concerns are present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The scores seem appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as 0.\n- **Security risk:** Correctly scored as 0, since the code is purely static definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward set of enum definitions with no security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this, assigning appropriate scores and reasoning. I concur with the assessments and scores provided.",
