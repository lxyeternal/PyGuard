  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various billing, project, and visibility labels and settings.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and their string assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward enum class definitions assigning string literals to named constants. There are no input/output operations, network interactions, or data manipulations that could lead to security issues. The code appears to be purely defining static configuration labels, which is typical in Python for clarity and maintainability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining enums for configuration purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
