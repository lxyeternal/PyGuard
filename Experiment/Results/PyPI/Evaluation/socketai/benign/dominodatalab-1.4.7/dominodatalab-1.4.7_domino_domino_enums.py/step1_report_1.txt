  "purpose": "Define enumerations for budget labels, types, billing tag modes, and project visibility settings.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present, as the code only defines enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; standard enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions used for categorizing configuration options or labels. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code appears to be straightforward and benign, intended for internal use within a larger application to enforce consistent values.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious set of enum definitions with no security concerns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
