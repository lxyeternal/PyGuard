  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of enum class definitions.\n- There are no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be straightforward, static, and intended for configuration or categorization purposes.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of enum definitions.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Specific issues and scoring:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the clear and benign nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is accurate.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; there are no signs of malicious intent or payloads.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- Since the code is only enum definitions, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors to assess.\n- No modifications or obfuscation are present that could hide malicious intent.\n- The reports do not overstate the security implications, which is good.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- The code is safe, benign, and serves a clear purpose in defining configuration constants.\n- No further security concerns are identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of enum definitions with no security risks. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
