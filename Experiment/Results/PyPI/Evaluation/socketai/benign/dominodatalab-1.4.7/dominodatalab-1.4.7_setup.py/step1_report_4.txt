{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'dominodatalab', configuring package metadata, dependencies, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version info, reading README file, reading '_version.py' for version, environment variables (indirectly via sys and pathlib).",
  "sinks": "Reading version info from '_version.py', accessing package metadata, network operations via URLs in setup (e.g., download_url), file operations (reading files).",
  "flows": "Python version check (source) influences script termination; reading '_version.py' (source) provides package version (sink); constructing URLs and package info (source) to download URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious URL patterns beyond standard GitHub link; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. The version extraction uses regex but is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for packaging a Python library. It checks Python version compatibility, reads the package version from a '_version.py' file, and constructs package metadata including download URLs. There are no signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden actions. The file operations are normal for setup scripts, and dependency specifications are standard. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward and aligns with common package configuration practices.",
