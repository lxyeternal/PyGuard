  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Findings**: The script is a standard setup script with no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It reads local files, constructs URLs, and sets package metadata.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Comments**: The analysis is accurate. The only minor point is the URL construction, but it relies on local data, not external influence.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- **Findings**: Again, a typical setup script. Reads version info, README, and sets up package metadata. No external data fetching or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — justified.\n- **Comments**: Correctly identified that the version reading is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- **Findings**: Similar to previous, standard setup script, reading local files, constructing URLs based on local data.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — justified.\n- **Comments**: No malicious activity, just standard package setup.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- **Findings**: Standard package setup, with environment checks, version reading, and URL construction. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — justified.\n- **Comments**: No security risks or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- **Findings**: Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — justified.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data flows that could be malicious.\n- The version reading function, while minimal, is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n- URL construction is based on local data, not external inputs.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is straightforward, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Note**: The code appears to be a typical, well-structured setup script with no indicators of compromise or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: No changes needed. The package setup code is safe and typical.",
