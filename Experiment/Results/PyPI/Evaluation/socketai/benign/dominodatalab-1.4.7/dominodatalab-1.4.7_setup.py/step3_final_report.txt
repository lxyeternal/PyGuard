  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, including version retrieval, dependency specification, and metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local file, reads README.md, and constructs URLs based on local data.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flows, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Local file reading for version info, URL construction from local variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with typical patterns. Minor note: file is opened but not explicitly closed, but this does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: checking Python version, reading local version info, reading README, and defining dependencies. No external data fetching, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The version is read from a local file using regex, which is a common pattern. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices for setup scripts. The lack of explicit file closing is a minor coding detail but does not constitute a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign Python package setup file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. No security issues or malicious intent are evident.",
