  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script, reading version info, README, and setting package metadata. No untrusted data sinks or suspicious code are present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The code is typical for a setup script, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices—reading version info, README, and configuring setup. No external data or dangerous operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script reads system info, version from a file, and constructs URLs. No suspicious code or external influence.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The code's behavior is typical for package setup, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard setup tasks—checking Python version, reading version info, constructing URLs. No malicious code or anomalies.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard package setup code, reading local files, dependencies, no external untrusted data or suspicious operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs standard setup tasks—reading version info, README, and configuring package metadata.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only minor point is the `get_version()` function reading a local file with regex. While this could be manipulated if an attacker controls the `_version.py` file, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **External Data/Network Activity:** No network calls, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** No obfuscated code or malware behaviors are detected.\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks.\n\nThe scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and align with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.",
