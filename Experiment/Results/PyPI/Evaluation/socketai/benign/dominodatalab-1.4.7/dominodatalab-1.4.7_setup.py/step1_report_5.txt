{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'dominodatalab', intended to define package metadata, dependencies, and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading the Python version info, reading the README file, reading the version from '_version.py', and gathering package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The script does not process untrusted input or output data to external sources that could cause harm. It primarily handles local file reading and package setup operations.",
  "flows": "Python version check -> Reading README -> Reading version from '_version.py' -> setup() invocation with package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup code with no suspicious or unusual behavior. The 'get_version()' function reads a local file '_version.py' to obtain version info, which is typical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies Python version compatibility, reads the package version from a local file, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious external calls, or malicious behaviors. The use of regular expressions to parse version info is typical, and no external or untrusted data is processed in a risky manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
