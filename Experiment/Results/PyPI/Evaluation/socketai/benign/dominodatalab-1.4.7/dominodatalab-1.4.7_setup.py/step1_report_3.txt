  "purpose": "Setup script for the domino Python package, managing package metadata, dependencies, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (sys.version_info), reads the README file, reads the _version.py file for version info, and constructs URLs for download and repository.",
  "sinks": "Uses get_version() to generate download_url and version, which could potentially execute arbitrary code if get_version() is compromised. However, in this context, it simply reads a file and matches regex; no external input influences these URLs directly.",
  "flows": "Reads system info → constructs version and URLs → calls setup with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. The get_version() function reads a version string from a file using regex, which is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks (Python version), reads package metadata and version info from a local file, and prepares setup parameters. The get_version() function reads a file and extracts a version string, which is standard. URLs are constructed based on the version. All operations are typical for a setup script. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads local files and constructs package metadata. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
