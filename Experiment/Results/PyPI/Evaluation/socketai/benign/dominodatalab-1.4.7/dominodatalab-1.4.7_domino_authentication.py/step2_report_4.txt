  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The report correctly identifies that the code performs standard authentication tasks, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The URL regex validation appears correct, and token handling is typical.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The confidence score (0.9) aligns with the assessment.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.  \n  Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly elevated but acceptable given environment variable handling and token files, which are common sources of risk if mismanaged.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score:**  \n  Since the code handles tokens and proxies securely, and no malicious activity is detected, a low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The report notes standard practices, no suspicious patterns, and proper URL handling.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound, and the analysis correctly states that the code is legitimate.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Security Risk: 0.1 — reasonable, given reliance on environment variables and token files, which are typical.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score:**  \n  The low risk score is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The report finds no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent and correct.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Security Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score:**  \n  No issues here; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The analysis confirms standard practices, no suspicious code, and proper credential handling.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No. The report's reasoning is accurate.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Security Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score:**  \n  No concerns; low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. The report states the code is typical, with no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores Review:**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Security Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Validity:** All reports correctly identify that the code performs standard, legitimate authentication functions without malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** All are appropriately set to 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1-0.2), justified given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — 0.2 — low, reflecting typical risks associated with environment variables and token files, but no active threats.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The provided scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
