{
  "purpose": "Provides authentication mechanisms for HTTP requests using various methods such as proxy, token, or API key.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for proxy URLs, API keys, and token file paths; reads token data from specified files.",
  "sinks": "Modifies request headers with authorization tokens; rewrites request URLs to route through proxies.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or input parameters provide credentials -> credentials are used to create Auth objects -> these modify request headers or URLs before network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The use of regex to parse URLs is standard, and environment variable fallbacks are common. No obfuscated code or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines authentication classes and functions for HTTP requests, supporting proxy and token-based auth. It uses environment variables as fallback options, which is typical. The regex parsing for URLs appears standard. No code performs external network connections, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code follows expected patterns for secure request authorization setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of request authentication with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely manages credentials and URL routing for authorized HTTP requests. The overall security risk is low.",
