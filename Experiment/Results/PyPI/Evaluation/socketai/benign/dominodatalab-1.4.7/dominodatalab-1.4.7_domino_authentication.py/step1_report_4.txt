{
  "purpose": "Provides authentication mechanisms for HTTP requests, including proxy-based, token-based, and environment-based authentication.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.getenv), reading token files (_from_token_file method), user-provided parameters (api_key, auth_token, domino_token_file, api_proxy).",
  "sinks": "Modifying request headers (r.headers['Authorization']), URL rewriting (re.sub in _replaceHostWithProxy), possibly reading sensitive tokens from files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters or environment variables → create Auth object → modify request headers or URL → return Auth object for use in HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; environment variables and file reads used for tokens are standard; URL substitution is straightforward. No suspicious dynamic code or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines authentication classes and a factory function to select the appropriate auth method. It reads tokens from files, environment variables, or input parameters. The URL replacement uses regex but is safe in context. No obfuscated code, suspicious network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The file access pattern appears standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code appears to serve its purpose securely without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to handle authentication securely using standard methods. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The implementation is straightforward and appears safe.",
