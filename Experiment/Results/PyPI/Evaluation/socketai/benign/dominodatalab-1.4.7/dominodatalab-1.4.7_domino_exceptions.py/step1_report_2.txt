  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases within the Domino application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; solely exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are used for error handling but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple subclasses of Exception with no additional code or dynamic execution; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of custom exception classes for a specific application context. These classes inherit from a common base class and contain only pass statements, serving as structured error identifiers. There are no inputs, outputs, or logic that could be exploited maliciously. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions. No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
