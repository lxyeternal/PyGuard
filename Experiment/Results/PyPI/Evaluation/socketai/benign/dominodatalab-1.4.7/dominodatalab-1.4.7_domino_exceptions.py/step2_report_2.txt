  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base class `DominoException`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, I/O, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The classes are empty, serving as error identifiers, with descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Content**:\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears to be standard boilerplate for structured exception handling.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, straightforward, and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The assessments are consistent and well-founded based on the code provided.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code content.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, the risk is minimal.\n   - No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious payload or behavior.\n   - The security risk score should also be 0.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is accurate.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, safe set of custom exception classes.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The provided reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and safe. The reports correctly identify this, and no changes are necessary.",
