  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases within the Domino system.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading occurs; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; this is purely a class definition module.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; all classes are standard exception subclasses with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception class. Each class has a descriptive docstring but no methods, logic, or data manipulation. No input handling, no data processing, no network or file operations are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python project to define specific exception types for various error conditions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard boilerplate for exception handling in a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is a clean, conventional implementation of custom exceptions.",
