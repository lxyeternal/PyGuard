{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions within a Domino-related application or library.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines classes and their inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling, I/O, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely class definitions and inheritance without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions inheriting from a base exception class. It serves as a structured way to manage different error scenarios in a larger system. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or network interactions. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard and safe implementation of custom exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious set of class definitions for exception handling. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and unrelated to supply chain or security vulnerabilities.",
