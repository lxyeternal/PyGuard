  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the Domino application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow occurs in exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various exception types inheriting from a base DominoException. These classes are empty and serve as custom exception types, which is standard practice in Python for handling specific error conditions. There are no input sources, data handling, or security-sensitive operations present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears straightforward and intended for error handling within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
