  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base `DominoException`.\n   - All classes are empty, serving solely as error identifiers.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or runtime logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Assessment**:\n   - The code is straightforward, standard Python exception class definitions.\n   - No embedded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No evidence of supply chain manipulation or malicious payloads.\n   - The malware score is correctly assigned as 0 across all reports.\n\n3. **Risk & Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and simple.\n   - Security risk: 0, given the absence of any security-sensitive operations or vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports' assigned scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Logical & Reasoning Checks**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional and non-malicious.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and safe is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Improvements**:\n   - Since the code is standard, no changes to scores are necessary.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) in each report is appropriate.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct, code is clear)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (correct, no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate** aligns perfectly with the reports:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and justified.",
