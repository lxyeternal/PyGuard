  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that there are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious patterns. No flaws or logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - *Malware Score*: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - *Obfuscated Score*: All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - *Security Risk Score*: All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n   \n   These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions for exceptions, there is no basis for higher risk scores. No logic, network activity, or data handling exists that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they only describe what the code does—define exception classes—and conclude that it is safe. This is appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores align well with the detailed reasoning. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes, typical in Python projects. There are no signs of supply chain vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The scores are appropriate, and there is no need to adjust them. The code poses no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. No further action needed.",
