  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from a base class. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, external interactions, or inputs.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard Python exception class hierarchy.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or security-related issues.\n   - They accurately note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The assessments are justified and aligned with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain suspicious patterns.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual observations—simple class definitions with no runtime logic or external dependencies.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made; the analysis is factual.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent in their scoring and reasoning.\n   - The assessments are uniform and justified.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is appropriate for its intended purpose.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0              |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature and the appropriateness of the existing scores.",
