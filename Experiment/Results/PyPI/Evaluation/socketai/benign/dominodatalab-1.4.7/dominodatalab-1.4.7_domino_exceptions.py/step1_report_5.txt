{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases in a Domino application",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are defined statically without input handling",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; class definitions do not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow; simply class inheritance structure without runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; all classes are straightforward custom exceptions inheriting from Exception",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions inheriting from a base class. There are no input reads, data processing, or output operations. No hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or obfuscation are present. The structure is typical for Python exception hierarchy. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to serve as part of an error handling framework within a larger application.",
