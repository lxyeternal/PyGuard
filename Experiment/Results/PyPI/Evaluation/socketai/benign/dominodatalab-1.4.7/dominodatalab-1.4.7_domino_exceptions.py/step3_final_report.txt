{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling within the Domino system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static and serve as error identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external calls, or data processing; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; classes are used for exception raising within other code modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a base exception class, with descriptive docstrings. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors. The structure is standard for error handling in Python. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is static, benign, and serves as a framework for exception management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for inclusion in larger projects and does not pose any supply chain threat.",
