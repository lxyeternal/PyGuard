  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base `DominoException`.\n   - All classes are empty and only serve as specific error identifiers.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or external interactions.\n   - The classes contain descriptive docstrings but no logic or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.\n   - No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or code injection.\n   - No external data handling, network calls, or file operations.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as an error handling framework.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Supply Chain Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is static class definitions with no runtime logic, it does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is unlikely to be a vector for supply chain attacks, as it does not process untrusted data or perform any external operations.\n   - The absence of obfuscation or hidden behaviors further reduces risk.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n5. **Any Issues in the Reports?**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and safe.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n   - No report suggests any hidden issues or potential vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely class declarations, it’s unlikely to be involved in supply chain issues unless malicious code is injected elsewhere in the project.\n   - The exception classes are well-structured and serve a clear purpose within a larger system.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I concur that the code is safe, non-malicious, and free from obfuscation or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code’s nature.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application’s error handling framework.",
