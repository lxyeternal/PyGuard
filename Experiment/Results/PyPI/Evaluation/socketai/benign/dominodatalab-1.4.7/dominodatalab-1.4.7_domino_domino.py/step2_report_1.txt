  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flows, potential vulnerabilities, anomalies, and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Acts as a client for the Domino platform, managing projects, jobs, datasets, models, billing, etc.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, function parameters, token files, API responses.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests (HTTP methods), file uploads, response processing.\n- **Flows:** Data from user inputs/env variables into API payloads; responses processed and logged.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, backdoors, obfuscation; standard warnings.\n- **Analysis:** Functionality aligns with a typical SDK; no malicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscated code. Validation routines are standard, and network activity is expected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe client SDK. Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report's reasoning is sound, and the low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1—client SDK for Domino API.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, parameters, API responses.\n- **Sinks:** API requests, logs, file uploads.\n- **Flows:** Inputs into payloads, responses parsed and returned.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, only a deprecated method warning.\n- **Analysis:** Functions as a standard SDK, with proper validation and no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured, no malicious intent. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No concerns about malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client SDK for resource management.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, files, parameters.\n- **Sinks:** API requests, logs, files.\n- **Flows:** Data from inputs to API, responses back.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, only a deprecation warning.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK functions, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, low security risk. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client SDK for managing resources.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, user inputs, API responses.\n- **Sinks:** API calls, logs, file uploads.\n- **Flows:** Data flows are typical for an SDK.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard use of warnings.\n- **Analysis:** Functions as expected; no malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe SDK, low malware and obfuscation scores. Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client SDK for resource management.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, parameters, API responses.\n- **Sinks:** API requests, logs, files.\n- **Flows:** Typical data flow for SDK.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, only a warning.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard SDK functions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, low risk. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-founded conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, justified by the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the nature of an SDK with standard validation and no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is transparent, no obfuscation).\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard SDK functions, no secrets or backdoors).\n\n---\n\n**Overall:** The reports are consistent, and the reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the detailed analysis. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Recommendation:** The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It appears to be a legitimate, well-maintained client SDK for the Domino platform.",
