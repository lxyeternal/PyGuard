{
  "purpose": "Acts as a client SDK for the Domino platform, managing projects, jobs, datasets, models, billing, and other resources via API interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, API responses, token files, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network requests (HTTP methods), file uploads, response processing, logs.",
  "flows": "Data from user inputs/env variables into API payloads; responses parsed and logged; no dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Warnings about deprecated methods are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a comprehensive SDK for resource management on the Domino platform. It performs standard validation, handles authentication tokens securely, and interacts with APIs using typical HTTP methods. No signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Validation routines are standard, and the code structure is clear and readable. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices. The use of environment variables and response handling aligns with best practices for SDKs. The only minor concern is the deprecation warning, which is benign and indicates ongoing maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured client SDK with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It performs expected resource management functions securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the absence of malicious patterns and standard validation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the platform's security posture based on this code is negligible.",
