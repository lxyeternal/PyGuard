  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured client SDK with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It performs expected resource management functions securely. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by the absence of malicious patterns and standard validation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the platform's security posture based on this code is negligible."
