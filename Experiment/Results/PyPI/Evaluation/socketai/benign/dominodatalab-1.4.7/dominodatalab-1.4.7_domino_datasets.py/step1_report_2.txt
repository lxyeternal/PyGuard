{
  "purpose": "This code handles uploading files or directories in chunks to a remote server, managing upload sessions, and performing retries on failures.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include local file paths, directory traversal, and HTTP responses for starting, testing, uploading, and ending upload sessions.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST and GET requests that send file chunks, session control commands, and test responses; files are read from disk and sent over network.",
  "flows": "Local file reading (sources) flows into chunk creation, then into upload testing, and finally into network upload requests; session management controls the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident; environment variables are not used insecurely; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The code does use retries and network requests but no suspicious URL patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard chunked file upload process, with session control and retries, using typical Python libraries. It reads files from local disk, creates chunks, tests whether upload is needed via server responses, and uploads chunks with progress logging. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert network communications are present. The use of network requests to specific routes seems legitimate for a file upload API. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The code uses retries and exception handling properly, without obfuscated constructs or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical file uploader with session management, chunking, and retry mechanisms. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for legitimate file upload purposes.",
