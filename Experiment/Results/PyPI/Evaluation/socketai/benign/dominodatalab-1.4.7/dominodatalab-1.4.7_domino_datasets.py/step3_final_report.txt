{
  "purpose": "The code implements a chunked file upload utility with session management, checksum validation, retries, and network communication to a remote server, facilitating large file uploads in parts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from local files via open() calls, and from the filesystem using os.path and os.walk for directory traversal.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made through request_manager.post and request_manager.get, which send data and control commands to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Source: file reads and directory traversal -> checksum testing and chunk reading -> network requests for testing and uploading chunks -> session start/end/cancel requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Path normalization to Unix style is standard. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file chunking, checksum validation, session management, and network communication for uploading files. It handles errors appropriately, uses retries, and converts Windows paths for API compatibility. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident, and the logic aligns with typical file upload implementations. The high confidence scores (0.9) and low malware (0) and obfuscation (0) scores are justified. The overall security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal concern due to network interactions but is appropriate given the benign code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard chunked file uploader with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure, indicating a very low security risk.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
