  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard file uploader with session management, chunking, retries, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence based on the detailed analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent, and the scores seem appropriate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, describing a standard chunked upload process with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code, and the scores are reasonable. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard file upload with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code and previous assessments. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a typical chunked upload process, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation matches the code's functionality. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard upload utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is a legitimate chunked file uploader, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Low (0.2), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), given the detailed reasoning.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — **correct**.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — **appropriate**, as the code performs standard file uploads with no evident security issues.\n\n**In conclusion**, the reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (as per the reports, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities and malicious activity)\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**  \nThe code performs standard file chunking, checksum validation, session management, and retries over HTTP. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The code handles files safely, with no obfuscation or secrets. The low security risk score reflects this.\n\n**Final note:** The scores given in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.",
