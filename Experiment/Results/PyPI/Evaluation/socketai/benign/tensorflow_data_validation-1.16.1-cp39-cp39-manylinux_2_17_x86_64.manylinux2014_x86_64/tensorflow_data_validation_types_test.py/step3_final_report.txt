{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for Apache Beam and PyArrow serialization, verifying encoding and decoding of record batches with internal tracking.",
  "sources": "In-memory creation of record batches, registration of custom coders, and internal method calls within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; all data remains within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Creation of record batches -> registration of custom coder -> encoding/decoding calls -> verification via singleton tracker.",
  "anomalies": "Use of singleton pattern for internal call tracking is standard; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs internal testing of data serialization, with no external data flow, network activity, or malicious payloads. The singleton tracker monitors encode/decode calls, which is typical in test scenarios. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with benign testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for Apache Beam and PyArrow serialization, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate.",
