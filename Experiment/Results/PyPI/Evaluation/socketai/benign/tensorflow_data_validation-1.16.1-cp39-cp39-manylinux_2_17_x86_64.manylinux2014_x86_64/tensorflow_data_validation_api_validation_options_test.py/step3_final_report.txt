  "purpose": "Unit test for the ValidationOptions class in tensorflow_data_validation, verifying attribute access and correctness.",
  "sources": "Import statements, creation of FeaturePath objects, instantiation of ValidationOptions with static data, assertions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or system effects; purely in-memory test assertions.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from creation to assertions; no untrusted data or external effects involved.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign unit test verifying attribute access of ValidationOptions. It uses static, safe data and performs no network, file, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code structure and data are typical for testing purposes, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify it as benign, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
