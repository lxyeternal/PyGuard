  "purpose": "Unit testing for validation_options module in TensorFlow Data Validation",
  "sources": "Import statements and test case setup; no external data input sources",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data is used or affects system state",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up and runs tests",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that imports modules, sets up test data, and asserts equality of attributes. It uses standard testing libraries and imports from TensorFlow Data Validation. There are no network calls, eval/exec, or external data handling. No suspicious or malicious code detected. It primarily verifies the proper functioning of the ValidationOptions class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite with no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security issues. It is benign and intended for testing purposes.",
