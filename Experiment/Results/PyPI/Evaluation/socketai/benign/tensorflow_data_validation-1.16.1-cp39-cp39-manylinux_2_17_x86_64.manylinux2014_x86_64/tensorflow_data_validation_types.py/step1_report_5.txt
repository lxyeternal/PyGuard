{
  "purpose": "Defines types, configurations, and custom Apache Beam coder for handling Arrow record batches in data validation workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (apache_beam, numpy, pyarrow, tensorflow_data_validation.utils.path), and class/variable initializations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data outputs or network communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (RecordBatch objects) through encoding/decoding functions, with no external untrusted input or output identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code performs typical data handling and serialization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases, configuration classes, and a custom Apache Beam coder for Arrow RecordBatch objects. It uses standard libraries and well-documented APIs without suspicious logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, backdoors, or secret code execution. The code's purpose appears to be data serialization/deserialization for data validation workflows. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of types, configurations, and a custom coder for Arrow record batches in a data validation context. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
