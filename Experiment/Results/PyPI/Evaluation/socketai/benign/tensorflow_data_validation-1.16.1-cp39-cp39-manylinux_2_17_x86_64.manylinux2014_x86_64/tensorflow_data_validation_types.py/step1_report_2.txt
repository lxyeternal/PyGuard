{
  "purpose": "Define types, configurations, and a custom coder for Apache Beam to handle Arrow RecordBatches, primarily for data validation and processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party modules (apache_beam, numpy, pyarrow), and internal utils from tensorflow_data_validation.utils",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or network operations; the code primarily defines classes and functions for data processing",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within this snippet; functions and classes are configuration and utility definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious backdoors present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases, a configuration class for feature statistics, and a custom Apache Beam coder for Arrow RecordBatches. It imports known libraries and does not include any network activity, file system manipulation, or untrusted data handling. The custom coder securely serializes and deserializes data using Arrow IPC streams with threading disabled, which is standard practice for performance and safety. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility module for data processing workflows involving Apache Beam and Arrow. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal, and the overall purpose is to facilitate data validation and transformation tasks.",
