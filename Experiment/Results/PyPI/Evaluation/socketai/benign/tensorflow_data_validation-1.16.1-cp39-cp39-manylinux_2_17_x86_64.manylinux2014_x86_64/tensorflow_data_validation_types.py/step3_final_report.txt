{
  "purpose": "Defines data types, configuration classes, and a custom Apache Beam coder for Arrow RecordBatches used in data validation workflows.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from Arrow RecordBatches during serialization/deserialization processes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; data is serialized/deserialized internally within the pipeline.",
  "flows": "Data flows from pa.RecordBatch objects into bytes via encode(), then back into pa.RecordBatch via decode().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard serialization with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for data serialization in data validation pipelines. It uses Apache Arrow IPC streams with threading disabled for safety. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The custom coder correctly serializes and deserializes RecordBatches, and the configuration classes manage feature stats settings. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for data serialization within data validation workflows. There are no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
