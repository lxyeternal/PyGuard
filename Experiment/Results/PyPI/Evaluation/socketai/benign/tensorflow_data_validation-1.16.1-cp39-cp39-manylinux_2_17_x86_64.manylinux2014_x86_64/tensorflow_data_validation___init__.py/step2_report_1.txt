  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static import statements in a package initialization module.\n- They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only exception is report 5, which assigns a security risk score of 0.1, citing the potential for data leaks if untrusted data is loaded and then outputted.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of the code as-is:** The code is purely static import statements, with no dynamic logic, data handling, or network operations.\n- **Malicious activity or malware:** None of the reports find evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **Security risks:** The overall risk is minimal, given the static nature of the code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- **In the analysis,** some reports mention potential data leaks if untrusted data is loaded and then outputted, which is a valid consideration in the broader context of the package's usage, but not a flaw in this specific code snippet.\n- **Report 5's security risk score of 0.1** seems to overstate the risk of the static import module, which in itself does not process data.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, which is reasonable. Report 5 assigns 0.1, citing potential data leaks, but this is speculative based on how the package might be used, not on the code itself.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code does **not** perform any data processing, network communication, or handle untrusted input directly.\n- The mention of potential data leaks is a broader concern but not a direct issue in this static import module.\n- The scores should reflect the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no inherent security risk in static imports)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are consistent in their conclusions.\n- The only point of contention is report 5's non-zero security risk, which I believe is overstated given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n| Metric             | Final Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware            | **0**                |\n| Obfuscated         | **0**                |\n| Security Risk      | **0**                |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: static, benign import statements with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
