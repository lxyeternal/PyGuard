{
  "purpose": "Defines constants used in TensorFlow Data Validation for data slicing, metrics, and placeholders.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, and util.MakeTfxNamespace for namespace creation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of placeholder constants is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines string constants related to data validation slices and placeholders. It also calls a utility function to generate a namespace for metrics. All elements are straightforward and serve configuration purposes. No code execution, data handling, or external communication is present that could be malicious. The code appears to be a typical configuration module for a data validation framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration/constants module for TensorFlow Data Validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
