  "purpose": "Defines constants used in TensorFlow Data Validation for data processing and validation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, import from tfx_bsl.telemetry.util for namespace creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; constants are static values or function calls for namespace creation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard code for constants definition and imports, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward constants module with standard licensing comments, imports, and variable definitions. No user input, network activity, or untrusted data handling present. The imported function util.MakeTfxNamespace could be checked for malicious behavior, but assuming standard library code, it is unlikely malicious. The constants are typical for data validation purposes. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module used in TensorFlow Data Validation. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
