{
  "purpose": "Defines constant identifiers and placeholders used in TensorFlow Data Validation for slices, namespace, batch size, and data placeholders.",
  "sources": "Static constants; the code imports from __future__ and util.MakeTfxNamespace for namespace creation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static constants without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining constants for data validation purposes. It imports utility functions for namespace creation, but no data processing, input handling, or external communication occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-structured, with comments and licensing, indicating standard practice. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign constants module for TensorFlow Data Validation with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action needed.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
