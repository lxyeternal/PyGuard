  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static constant definitions related to TensorFlow Data Validation.\n- The code involves imports from `__future__` and a utility module, with no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is purely configuration/setup, serving as constants for data validation purposes.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign with high confidence (1), and all assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code snippets.\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct, straightforward, and consistent with its purpose.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected. The logic is simple constant definitions, and the reasoning in reports is sound.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Potential adjustments:** No adjustments necessary; scores seem appropriate given the code.\n\n### Malware, obfuscation, and risk justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** The code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks are evident.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- All claims are based on static analysis, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are unjustified; the code is standard configuration.\n\n### Consistency:\n- Scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard constants module for TensorFlow Data Validation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the existing assessments. The code is safe, and the scores reflect its benign nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
