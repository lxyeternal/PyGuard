{
  "purpose": "Define constants used in TensorFlow Data Validation within the TFX ecosystem.",
  "sources": "Imports from tfx_bsl.telemetry.util and module-level constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code consists solely of constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions and defines several string constants related to data validation, metrics, and placeholders. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The constants serve as configuration or label identifiers. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present. The use of comments and licensing information further confirms standard open-source code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions used for TensorFlow Data Validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
