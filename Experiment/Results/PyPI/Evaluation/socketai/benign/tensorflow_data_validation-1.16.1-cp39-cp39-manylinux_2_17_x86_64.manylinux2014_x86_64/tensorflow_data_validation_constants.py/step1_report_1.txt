  "purpose": "Define constants used in TensorFlow Data Validation for data processing and metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, import from tfx_bsl.telemetry.util.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output to external systems observed.",
  "flows": "Constants are set as static values; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future compatibility features and a utility module. It defines several string constants for use in data validation tasks, such as slice names, namespace, batch size, and placeholders. The constants are static and do not process or handle any external input or output. No code execution, dynamic evaluation, or data manipulation is present. Overall, the code serves as configuration/setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign set of constant definitions for TensorFlow Data Validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and purposeful for its intended use.",
