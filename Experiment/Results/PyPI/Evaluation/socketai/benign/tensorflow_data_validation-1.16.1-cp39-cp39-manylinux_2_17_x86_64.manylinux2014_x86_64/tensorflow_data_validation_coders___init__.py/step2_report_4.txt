  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as purely licensing comments with no executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- The confidence level is consistently 1, indicating high certainty that these snippets are benign boilerplate.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of executable or malicious content.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the above.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms only license and copyright comments.  \n- No code or data flow present.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Score justification:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Same conclusion: license header, no executable code.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- License comments only, no code.  \n- No data input/output or flows.  \n- **Score justification:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- License header, no executable statements.  \n- No data handling or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Score justification:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Licensing boilerplate only, no code or data flows.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Score justification:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the snippets as non-malicious, purely licensing comments.\n- The malware scores are appropriately 0.\n- The security risk scores are correctly 0, given the absence of executable or suspicious content.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- Since these are just license comments, I would assign the following scores for similar code snippets:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary. The code snippets are benign licensing boilerplate with no security implications.",
