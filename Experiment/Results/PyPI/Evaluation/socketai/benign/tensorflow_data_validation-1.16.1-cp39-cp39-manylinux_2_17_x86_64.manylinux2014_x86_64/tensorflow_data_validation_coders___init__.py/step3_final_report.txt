  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing comments with no executable code or data handling, serving as boilerplate license headers.",
  "sources": "N/A (comments only, no data input or output sources present)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flows or untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flows, as there is no executable code)",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs; only licensing comments present",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of licensing comments with no functions, variables, or executable statements. No data input, output, or dynamic behavior exists. The comments are standard legal boilerplate, and there are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The high confidence score (1) reflects certainty that the code is benign. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk score is 0, given the absence of executable or data-handling code. The obfuscated score is 0, as comments are straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely licensing boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. All scores are appropriate and consistent with the content, indicating a benign, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated snippet with no security risks.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
