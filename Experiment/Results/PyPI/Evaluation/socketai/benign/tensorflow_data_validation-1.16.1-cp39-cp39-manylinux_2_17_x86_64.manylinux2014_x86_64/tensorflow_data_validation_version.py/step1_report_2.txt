  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the TFDV package, used for versioning and distribution.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the '__version__' variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets a static version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior present; the code is straightforward and standard for a version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains license information and a single assignment statement setting the '__version__' variable to a static string. It includes licensing comments and a version string. No input handling, no dynamic code, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. The code is typical for a package's version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate for a Python package, with no anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
