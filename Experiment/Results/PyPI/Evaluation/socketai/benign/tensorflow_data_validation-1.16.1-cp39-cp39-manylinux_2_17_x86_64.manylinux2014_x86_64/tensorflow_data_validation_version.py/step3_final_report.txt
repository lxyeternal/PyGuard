{
  "purpose": "This code declares a static version string for the package, serving as metadata for versioning purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains licensing comments and a hardcoded string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code performs a simple assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; it is straightforward boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a static assignment of the version string '__version__ = '1.16.1''. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external data handling. The code is a common pattern in open source projects for version declaration. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
