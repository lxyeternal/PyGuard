  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a simple, static assignment of the version string `'1.16.1'` to the variable `__version__`.\n   - The code contains only licensing comments and a straightforward variable assignment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No obfuscation, no hidden code, and no suspicious operations are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Based on the code provided, there is no indication of malware, malicious code, or any activity that could compromise security.\n   - The code is a standard boilerplate for version declaration, common in many open source projects.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty about the benign assessment.\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code; the logic and reasoning in the reports are sound.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n   - No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is completely benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
