  "purpose": "Define and expose the version string of the TFDV package.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.16.1' to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to potential data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment of a constant string to a variable; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single assignment of a static version string to __version__. No input/output handling, no dynamic code, no network activity, or environment variable usage. It is a typical version definition file with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version string declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate for a Python package versioning.",
