  "purpose": "Define and expose the version string of the TFDV package for version control and referencing within setup scripts.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the version string '__version__' with a hardcoded value '1.16.1'.",
  "sinks": "The version string may be imported or used in other parts of the package or setup.py, but there are no direct sinks in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded version string flows from the assignment to any module that imports this variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains only licensing comments and a simple variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version declaration with licensing comments. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The license comments are standard boilerplate. The version is hardcoded, which is common practice, and there are no suspicious operations, external data sources, or potential injection points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of license comments and a simple version variable declaration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
