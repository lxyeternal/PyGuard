  "purpose": "Decode CSV records into in-memory Arrow RecordBatches for TensorFlow Data Validation, with deprecated usage warning.",
  "sources": "Input lines from a PCollection of strings representing CSV lines.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> CSV decoder -> RecordBatch output; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is primarily initializing parameters and calling a CSV decoding transform.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Beam PTransform class for decoding CSV data into RecordBatches. It includes input validation for column_names and parameter passing to the csv_decoder.CSVToRecordBatch method. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network access, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The presence of a deprecation warning indicates maintained functionality, not malicious intent. The overall structure appears consistent with typical data processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a CSV decoder for TensorFlow Data Validation pipelines, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard parameter handling and delegating to an existing CSV decoder. No suspicious or malicious logic is present.",
