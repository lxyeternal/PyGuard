  "purpose": "Decodes CSV records into in-memory Arrow RecordBatches for TensorFlow Data Validation, delegating actual decoding to an external library.",
  "sources": "Reads input lines as strings from the PCollection; uses external csv_decoder.CSVToRecordBatch for decoding.",
  "sinks": "Outputs RecordBatches; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> parameter validation -> delegation to csv_decoder.CSVToRecordBatch -> output RecordBatches.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is a straightforward wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on 'column_names' and passes configuration parameters to an external CSV decoding function. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The deprecation notice is a maintenance note, not an indicator of malicious intent. External dependencies are assumed safe; within this snippet, no vulnerabilities or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data transformation component with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
