  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines an empty or commented requirements list; calls setuptools.setup() with metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out dependency requirements; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The commented dependencies are benign and do not introduce risk. No external data flows or dynamic execution are present. The minimal security risk score in some reports (0.1) is unjustified given the benign nature; it should be set to 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation. The slight overestimation of security risk in one report should be corrected to zero.",
