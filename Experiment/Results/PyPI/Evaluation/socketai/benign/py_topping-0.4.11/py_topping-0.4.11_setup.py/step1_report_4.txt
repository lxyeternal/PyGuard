  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'py_topping', primarily for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; no other input sources are present.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only reads a file and configures package info.",
  "anomalies": "The requirements list contains commented-out dependency entries; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. The only input is a README file, which is benign. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The commented requirements could be remnants of development but do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
