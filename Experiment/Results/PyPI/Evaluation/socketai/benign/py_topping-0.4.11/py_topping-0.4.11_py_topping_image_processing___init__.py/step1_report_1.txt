{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for loading, processing, and predicting with image models, including autoencoders and classifiers, using TensorFlow and OpenCV.",
  "sources": "The code reads image data from input parameters and loads models from specified file paths.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Input images are formatted via 'format_image', then passed through the model in 'predict'. The prediction output is returned in various formats depending on 'output_type'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Use of TensorFlow and OpenCV libraries appears standard. No suspicious network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a model from a specified path, with optional custom objects, and performs image preprocessing including color conversion, resizing, normalization. The predict method runs the model within a device context, processes the output, and returns predictions or reconstructed images. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activities. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or backdoors are evident. The use of standard libraries and typical image processing techniques suggest normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for image model loading and prediction with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
