{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to load a TensorFlow Keras model (either image classifier or autoencoder), process images, and generate predictions or losses for image data.",
  "sources": "Reads input images via the format_image method; loads model from specified path; uses model.predict to generate output.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction output, which could be used in further processing; no explicit untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input images are processed in format_image, then passed to model.predict, and the output is formatted or returned depending on the model type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behaviors or obfuscated code; no network communication, file system tampering, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for image model inference, including image preprocessing and prediction. It imports common libraries (TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV), loads models, and processes images with configurable options. The class methods handle image formatting, normalization, and prediction output formatting. The code structure is standard for model inference pipelines. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors is evident. Usage of device context ensures model runs on specified hardware. The code appears clean and well-structured with no anomalies indicative of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a TensorFlow model inference pipeline for image data. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. It is safe from a cybersecurity perspective based on the provided fragment.",
