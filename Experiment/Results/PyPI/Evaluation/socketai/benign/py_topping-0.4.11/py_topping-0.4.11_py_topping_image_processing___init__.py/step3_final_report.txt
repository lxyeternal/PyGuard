{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for loading, preprocessing, and predicting with TensorFlow/Keras image models, including autoencoders and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Model file loading, image input data, normalization parameters, device context for inference.",
  "sinks": "Prediction outputs (classification probabilities, reconstructed images, loss calculations).",
  "flows": "Input image -> format_image (color conversion, resize, normalize) -> model.predict -> output processing based on model type.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and practices for image preprocessing and model inference. No network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The model loading is straightforward, and the image formatting includes typical normalization. The predict method handles different output types appropriately. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are identified. The code's structure and comments suggest a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation for image model inference with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk score to 0.1, reflecting minimal concern consistent with the code's functionality.",
