{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for loading, formatting, and predicting using TensorFlow/Keras models for image classification or auto-encoding tasks, with optional image preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Reading model from a file path via load_model, reading images via function parameters, reading class_list and other configurations during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction output, image processing functions like cv2.cvtColor, normalization operations, and potential use of device context for computation.",
  "flows": "Image input -> format_image (resizes, recolors, normalizes) -> predict (model inference) -> output based on model type and output_type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no obfuscated code. Use of device context is typical for TensorFlow but does not indicate malicious activity. No unusual behavior or code flow anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of an image processing class using TensorFlow/Keras. It loads models, processes images with optional color conversion and normalization, and performs predictions. The use of cv2 and numpy is standard. No suspicious or malicious code segments, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code adheres to typical ML deployment practices. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward image model wrapper for TensorFlow/Keras models with standard preprocessing and prediction functions. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears safe and intended solely for ML inference tasks.",
