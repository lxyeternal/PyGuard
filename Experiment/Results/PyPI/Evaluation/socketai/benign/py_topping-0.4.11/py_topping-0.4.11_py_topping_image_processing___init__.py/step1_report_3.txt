{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for loading and using TensorFlow Keras models for image classification or auto-encoder tasks, including image preprocessing and prediction functions.",
  "sources": "Reading input images via the format_image method, loading models with load_model, and model.predict calls.",
  "sinks": "Model predictions which could potentially be used for data leakage if misused; no other external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input image → format_image (preprocessing) → model.predict → output (classification or autoencoder result).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a Keras model, processes images with OpenCV, normalizes data, and performs predictions. The class allows for different model types ('image' or 'autoencoder') and handles image conversion, resizing, and normalization in a standard manner. The predict method executes model inference within a device context, which is a typical approach to specify GPU or CPU usage. No suspicious or malicious functions, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All operations align with standard image processing and model inference workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a model inference pipeline for image tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It functions as intended for its purpose without any hidden or suspicious activity.",
