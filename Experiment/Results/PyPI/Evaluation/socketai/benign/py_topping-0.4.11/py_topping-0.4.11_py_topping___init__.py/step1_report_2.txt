{
  "purpose": "Commented-out function intended for executing SQL operations and importing modules related to data connections and pipelines.",
  "sources": "No active code that reads input or data; only commented-out code and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external calls executed.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; no runtime source-to-sink paths since code is commented out.",
  "anomalies": "The function is entirely commented out, which prevents execution and obfuscates intent. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns are visible. Import statements are standard for data operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a commented-out function definition for a SQL-related operation, which accepts parameters including credentials, but is inactive. Imports include modules for database and SharePoint interactions, which are typical in data pipeline contexts. There are no active malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors present. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase and is currently disabled.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not contain active logic or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a placeholder or temporarily disabled code segment related to database and SharePoint data connections. No malicious intent or security risks are evident in the active parts of this snippet.",
