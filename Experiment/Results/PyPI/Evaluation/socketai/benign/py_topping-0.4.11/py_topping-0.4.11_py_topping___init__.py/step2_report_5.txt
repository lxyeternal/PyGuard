  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is commented out, inactive, with no malicious behavior.\n- Notes potential SQL injection if the code were active, but since it's not, no immediate risk.\n- Security risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential if activated.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the inactive, benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1; emphasizes the code is commented out, no active code or suspicious behavior.\n- Security risk is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, the code is inactive, with standard module imports and parameters.\n- No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- Security risk is 0.1.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: commented-out, inactive code, standard imports, no malicious behavior.\n- Security risk 0.1, malware 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Fully commented out, no active code, no suspicious elements.\n- Security risk 0, malware 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe code that is entirely commented out and inactive.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The potential security concern if the code were activated is noted, but since it is not, current risk is minimal.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1–0.2) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, mainly theoretical if code were active)\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign, inactive, and not malicious.**",
