  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code context, the scoring, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as commented-out, inactive, and standard in structure.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of sensitive parameters (user, password, credentials_path) if the code were active.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Describes a commented-out function for SQL interactions.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes inactivity and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 (low, due to potential if re-enabled).\n- **Conclusion:** No active risk, but potential if activated.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems reasonable. The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the inactive status but acknowledges possible future concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the commented-out nature.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no active code or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (very low).\n- **Conclusion:** No immediate concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, mentions standard modules and parameters.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states code is inactive, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous, notes the commented-out function.\n- **Analysis:** No active code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern, inactive code.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no active malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as inactive, commented-out, and standard.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the inactive, non-malicious nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the inactive status but acknowledging potential if re-enabled.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code is commented out and inactive, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is reasonable, as the reports suggest.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The current scores are consistent with the code's state.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code, as it stands, does not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to potential if re-enabled)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's inactive nature.",
