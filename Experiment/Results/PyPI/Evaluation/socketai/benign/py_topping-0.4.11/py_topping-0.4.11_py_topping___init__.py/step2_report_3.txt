  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the provided scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All code snippets are commented out, indicating they are inactive or placeholders.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The imports are standard for data handling modules.\n- The parameters include credentials and connection info, but since the code is inactive, no data flows or risks are currently present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a commented-out function for SQL interactions and related imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Since the code is commented out, no data flows or sinks are active.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; code is inactive.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No active malicious behavior; potential risk if activated, but currently inactive.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (slightly cautious, but justified given the parameters and potential if activated)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the inactive state and standard imports.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9), but no active code.\n- Security risk is low (0.1), justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Similar analysis; again, the code is commented out.\n- The security risk is minimal; the confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Same pattern: commented-out function, standard imports, no active code.\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9), low security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Entirely commented out, no active code.\n- Confidence is maximum (1), and no security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as inactive, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis: malware and obfuscated scores are zero across the board.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the inactive state and lack of suspicious content.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the parameters, defaults, and inactive code, a low risk score (~0.1) is justified, but some reports have slightly higher (0.2) to account for potential if reactivated.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scoring aligns well with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears safe in its current state, with no active malicious or obfuscated elements.",
