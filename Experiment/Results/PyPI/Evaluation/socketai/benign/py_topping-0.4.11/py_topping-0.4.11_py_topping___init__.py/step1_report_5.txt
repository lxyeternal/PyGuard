  "purpose": "Commented-out function definition for performing SQL operations with various configurable parameters.",
  "sources": "None active; the function and import statements are commented out and not executed.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code is commented out and does not execute any data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No executable flow exists due to comments; no source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely commented out, which might indicate it was intentionally disabled. No active code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of commented-out function definitions and import statements. No executable code or runtime logic is present. Since it is inactive, there is no potential for malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues from this fragment. The presence of commented code does not inherently suggest malicious intent but could be relevant if re-enabled. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inactive (commented out) and contains no executable statements. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
