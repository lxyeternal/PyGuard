{
  "purpose": "Commented-out Python functions and import statements related to database and SharePoint data connections, currently inactive.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'user', 'password', 'credentials_path' suggest potential data input points, but code is inactive.",
  "sinks": "No active data flows or untrusted data processing due to code being commented out.",
  "flows": "No active source-to-sink data flows; all code is inactive.",
  "anomalies": "All code snippets are entirely commented out; no suspicious or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of inactive, commented-out functions and import statements for database and SharePoint modules. There are no active data flows, no hardcoded secrets in use, and no obfuscated code. The parameters hint at sensitive data handling, but since the code is not executed, there is no immediate risk. The security and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the inactive state. If reactivated without proper validation, potential risks could emerge, but currently, the code poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is inactive and does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current security risk is negligible, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
