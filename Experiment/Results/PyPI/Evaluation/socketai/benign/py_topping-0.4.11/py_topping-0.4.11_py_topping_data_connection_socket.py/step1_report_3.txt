{
  "purpose": "Implement a simple TCP client-server communication utility with delay and optional data echo.",
  "sources": "Input data received via socket connections in listen() method, and data sent through send() method.",
  "sinks": "Data sent using s.sendall() and conn.sendall(), which could potentially send untrusted or malicious data over the network.",
  "flows": "listen() receives data from a client and optionally echoes it back; send() transmits data to a specified host and port, optionally waiting for a response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or unusual code behaviors are present. Use of sleep for delay is benign. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides TCP socket communication functions for sending and receiving data with configurable delay. It uses standard socket library functions without any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no signs of malware, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized system access. The code appears to be a straightforward TCP utility module, with no evident security flaws or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard TCP communication utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It is designed for general socket communication purposes. No security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
