{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple TCP client and server for sending and receiving data over a network connection.",
  "sources": "Reads host, port, delay_close from constructor; reads data from socket connections.",
  "sinks": "s.sendall(), conn.sendall(), socket.connect(), socket.bind(), socket.listen(), socket.accept(), socket.recv()",
  "flows": "Input data from send_message or received via socket flows through sendall() or recv(), potentially returning data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling; no obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic TCP socket communication with send and listen methods. It does not include code injection, data exfiltration, or system compromise mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious network behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for legitimate network communication. There are no obfuscation techniques or unusual code structures. The only potential concern could be if used maliciously to create covert communication channels, but as-is, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard TCP client/server utility without any evident malicious intent or security issues. It does not exhibit malware behavior or supply chain risks based on the provided snippet.",
