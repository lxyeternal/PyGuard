  "purpose": "The code implements a simple TCP client and server class for sending and receiving messages over a network.",
  "sources": "Input data from network connections (socket.recv). User-supplied send_message parameter in send() method.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of data via socket.sendall and socket.recv, potential for data exfiltration if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data from user or network -> sent via socket.sendall -> received via socket.recv -> optionally sent back in listen() method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. No obfuscated code. Uses standard socket operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic TCP communication functionalities: send and listen. It does not contain any code that reads external secrets, transmits system data without user intent, or connects to suspicious domains. The send() method can send arbitrary data, but that is typical for such functionality. The listen() method echoes received data if specified, which could be used for data exfiltration only if integrated maliciously, but on its own, it appears benign. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, privilege escalation, or data theft are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions without obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a basic TCP communication utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It could be misused if integrated into malicious workflows, but on its own, it is a standard implementation.",
