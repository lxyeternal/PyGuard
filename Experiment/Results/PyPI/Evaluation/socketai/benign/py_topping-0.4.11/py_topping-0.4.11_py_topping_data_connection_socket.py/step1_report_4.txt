{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple TCP client-server communication interface with optional delay and echo functionality.",
  "sources": "Host and port inputs during class initialization, data received through socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via socket connections, receiving data over socket connections, potentially returning data to callers.",
  "flows": "Data is sent through the send() method, received and optionally echoed back in listen() method; data flows from input parameters or network to socket send/recv.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic socket communication with methods to send and listen on specified host and port. The socket operations are standard, with no external or hidden network activity. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual data handling, and no dynamic code execution are present. The functionality is straightforward for TCP communication, with optional delays and echoing. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard TCP communication utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be used for malicious purposes based on this analysis.",
