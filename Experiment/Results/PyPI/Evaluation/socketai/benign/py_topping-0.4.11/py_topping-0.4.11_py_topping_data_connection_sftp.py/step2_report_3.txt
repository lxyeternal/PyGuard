  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward implementation of an SFTP client wrapper using paramiko.\n- Credentials are passed in plaintext during object initialization; no encryption or environment variable handling is implemented.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious control flows are present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities are evident.\n- The code uses standard practices like context managers for resource cleanup.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), aligning with typical credential handling.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- Plaintext storage of credentials in memory (not hardcoded) is common but could be improved.\n- No validation, encryption, or secure storage of credentials is implemented, which could be a security concern if credentials are mishandled outside this code.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious code or activities are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, correctly indicating the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns related to credential handling, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an SFTP client wrapper.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious activity is detected.\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (slightly cautious but acceptable)  \n\nThis aligns with the overall review: the code is functional, standard, and free of malicious intent, with minor security considerations related to credential handling.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** For enhanced security, consider using environment variables or encrypted storage for credentials, but this is outside the scope of this review.",
