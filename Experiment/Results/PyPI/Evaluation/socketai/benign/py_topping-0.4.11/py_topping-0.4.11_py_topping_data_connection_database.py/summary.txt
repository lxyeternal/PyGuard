  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured database utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The main security concern is the use of dynamic SQL string concatenation, which should be handled carefully in production environments to prevent injection. Overall, it presents a low security risk typical of such utilities."
