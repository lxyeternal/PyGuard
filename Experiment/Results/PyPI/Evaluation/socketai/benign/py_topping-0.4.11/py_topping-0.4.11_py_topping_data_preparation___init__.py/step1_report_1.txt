{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for encoding/decoding categorical variables, creating lag features, and explaining decision tree models, primarily for data preprocessing and model interpretability in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from pandas DataFrames, loads pre-trained encoders from pickle files, and reads model objects for explanation.",
  "sinks": "Writes encoded data back into DataFrames, exports encoded objects as pickle files, and generates text or DataFrame outputs for explanations.",
  "flows": "Data is read from DataFrames and pickle files for encoding and decoding; lag features are created via shifting DataFrame columns; decision tree explanations are generated by parsing exported text logic and applying it to input data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; functions operate as standard data preprocessing and interpretability tools. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No network operations or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, os, joblib) for typical ML data processing tasks. Encoding functions save and load label encoders, which is common practice. Lag feature creation and decision tree explanation classes are straightforward implementations with no signs of malicious intent. No suspicious file handling, network activity, or malicious code injection found. The structure and logic adhere to typical data science workflows, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for data preprocessing, lag feature creation, and model explanation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within the provided code. It operates solely within expected data science practices.",
