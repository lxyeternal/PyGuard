{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for data encoding/decoding, feature engineering (lag creation), and decision tree logic explanation, primarily for preprocessing and model interpretability in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads data from DataFrame columns, loads/saves label encoders from pickle files, and reads model objects (possibly from external files).",
  "sinks": "Uses pickle files for loading/saving encoders, applies transformations to DataFrames, and processes model exports for explanation. No network operations or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Loads encoders from disk -> Encodes/decodes DataFrame columns -> Creates lag features -> Exports and interprets decision tree logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses file operations and model exporting but does not contain obfuscated code, suspicious data leaks, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data preprocessing, encoding, lag feature creation, and decision tree explanation. It safely handles file I/O with pickle, which is typical for model persistence. No signs of malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system damage. The methods are straightforward and align with common machine learning practices. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware were identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility suite for data encoding, lag feature creation, and decision tree interpretation. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious activities present. It adheres to typical data science workflows and does not exhibit signs of malware or security risks.",
