  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding categorical variables, creating lag features, and explaining decision tree models.",
  "sources": "File system reads/writes for encoders ('load', 'dump'), reading input DataFrame columns, parsing model explanation text.",
  "sinks": "Loading and saving pickle files, DataFrame transformations, parsing text for explanations.",
  "flows": "Encoder files are loaded during encoding/decoding; lag features are created via DataFrame shifts; decision tree explanation text is parsed for interpretability.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. File operations are standard in ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ML preprocessing and explanation tasks using common libraries. No network activity, no malicious code, and no obfuscation are present. File I/O operations are typical but could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, which is acknowledged by low risk scores. The code is readable, straightforward, and aligns with typical practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk associated with filesystem operations is justified and minimal. Overall, the supply chain security posture is sound.",
