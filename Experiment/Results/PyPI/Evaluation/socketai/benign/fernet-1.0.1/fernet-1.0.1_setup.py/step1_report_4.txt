  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'fernet' that provides a simple Fernet encryption implementation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, modules, requirements, and classifiers.",
  "targets": "Does not directly handle user input or untrusted data; primarily defines package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A, the script only specifies package metadata and dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for Python packaging. It specifies package details, dependencies, and classifiers without any malicious code. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The dependencies listed (pyaes, pytest, cryptography) are common cryptographic libraries. No signs of obfuscated code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate and intended solely for package installation purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified based on this code.",
