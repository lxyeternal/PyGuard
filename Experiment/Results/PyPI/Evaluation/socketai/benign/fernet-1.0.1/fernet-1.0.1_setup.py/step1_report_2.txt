{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'fernet', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call with parameters defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted data sources are present; all data appears hardcoded within the setup configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A, no dynamic or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward package setup configuration with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It specifies dependencies such as 'pyaes' and 'cryptography' but does not include any code that executes untrusted data or performs malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration for distributing a cryptography-related Python package.",
