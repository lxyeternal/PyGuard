  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard `setup.py` configuration script.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is identified.\n- Dependencies are common cryptography libraries (`pyaes`, `cryptography`, `pytest`).\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- All reports assign high confidence (1.0) and zero malware, obfuscated, or security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** matches the descriptions: a typical `setup.py` with package metadata and dependencies.\n- No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The dependencies are legitimate and relevant.\n\n### Flaws or errors:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are present in the code or reasoning.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent, thorough, and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is clear.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk (0):** Correct, standard setup.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely a package configuration with no malicious intent, the risk score should remain very low, around 0.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- No evidence of malware. The dependencies are standard cryptography libraries, not malicious packages.\n- No signs of backdoors, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- All reports correctly interpret the code as a benign setup script.\n- No hidden malicious payloads are present in the dependencies (which are reputable).\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward, legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe analysis confirms that the package setup code is benign, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
