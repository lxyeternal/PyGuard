  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'fernet' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() function specifying package info, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. Dependencies are reputable cryptography libraries. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's static nature and reliance on well-known packages support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
