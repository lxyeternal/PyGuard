{
  "purpose": "Implement a symmetric encryption scheme with key generation, encryption, and decryption functions following the Fernet specification.",
  "sources": "os.urandom for key and IV generation, time.time() for timestamp, base64 decoding/encoding for tokens.",
  "sinks": "base64.urlsafe_b64decode and encode for token processing, hmac for message authentication, AES encryption/decryption for data confidentiality.",
  "flows": "Key generation from os.urandom -> encryption with AES and HMAC -> token creation -> decryption process verifies HMAC, timestamp, and decrypts ciphertext.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard cryptographic libraries and functions with proper key and IV handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard Fernet-like encryption scheme with proper cryptographic practices: secure key handling, timestamp validation, HMAC integrity check, and AES CBC mode encryption. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The only notable point is reliance on os.urandom and system time, which are typical and secure sources. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, correctly implemented cryptographic module for token-based encryption. No malicious behavior or sabotage observed. It appears to serve its intended purpose securely.",
