The code snippets and descriptions do not indicate any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports. The code appears to follow best practices for symmetric encryption and message authentication.\n\n- **Scores & Reasonableness:**\n  - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the reports stating no obfuscation.\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable given the cryptographic correctness and lack of known vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:** None of the reports justify a risk higher than 0.2, and given the analysis, this seems appropriate.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:** The reports assume correct cryptographic use and proper library functions. There are no claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions that seem unreasonable.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores:** The scores are consistent with the detailed analyses and descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** **0.2**\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.  \n- Proper cryptographic practices are followed.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious code structures.  \n- The cryptographic implementation appears correct and secure.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk for this dependency appears minimal. It is a standard, well-implemented cryptographic module with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always recommend ongoing monitoring and code audits, especially if used in high-security environments, but based on current reports, the risk is low.",
