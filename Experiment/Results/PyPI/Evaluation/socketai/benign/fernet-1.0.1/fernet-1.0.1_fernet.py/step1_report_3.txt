  "purpose": "Implementation of a Fernet-like symmetric encryption and signing module for secure data handling.",
  "sources": "Input data: token (decrypt method), key (constructor), data (encrypt method).",
  "sinks": "HMAC digest comparison, base64 encoding/decoding, cryptographic operations (encryption/decryption).",
  "flows": "Input data -> base64 decoding -> unpacking and validation -> HMAC digest comparison -> decryption -> plaintext output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external connections. Uses standard libraries and PyCrypto-based AES module. No suspicious data leakage or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements symmetric encryption with HMAC signing, employing secure practices like base64 encoding, nonce (IV), timestamp validation, and constant-time digest comparison. It correctly separates signing and encryption keys, performs timestamp validation with clock skew allowance, and handles errors properly. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. Uses standard cryptographic functions with proper validation, indicating adherence to security best practices. No evidence of malicious code or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Fernet-compatible encryption scheme with appropriate security measures. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies are evident. It is a standard cryptographic utility module with no indication of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
