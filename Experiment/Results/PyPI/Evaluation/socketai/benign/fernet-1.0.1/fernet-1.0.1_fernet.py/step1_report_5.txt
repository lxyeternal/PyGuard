  "purpose": "Implementation of a Fernet-like symmetric encryption and signing scheme for secure data encryption and decryption.",
  "sources": "os.urandom() for key generation and IV creation, time.time() for timestamping, base64.urlsafe_b64decode() for decoding keys and tokens, user-provided key for encryption/decryption, data input for encryption and decryption.",
  "sinks": "base64.urlsafe_b64encode() for output tokens, hmac.new() for signature generation, struct.pack/unpack() for timestamp encoding/decoding, encryption/decryption functions feeding data, os.urandom() generating IVs and keys.",
  "flows": "Key is generated via generate_key() and decoded for use; data is encrypted with self._encryption_key and current_time; token is formed with timestamp, IV, ciphertext, and HMAC; during decryption, token is validated, timestamp checked, HMAC verified, then ciphertext decrypted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of cryptographic functions appears standard. No malicious network activity, no data exfiltration, no hidden backdoors detected. The code correctly implements cryptographic best practices with proper HMAC validation and timestamp checks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a cryptographic scheme similar to Fernet, involving key handling, timestamping, encryption with AES CBC mode, HMAC signing, and validation during decryption. All security mechanisms seem properly implemented, including key size checks, timestamp validation with skew allowance, and digest comparison. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. No external network activity or data leaks are present. The use of standard libraries and correct cryptographic procedures suggest this is a secure implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented cryptographic module mimicking Fernet functionality, with no malicious behavior detected. It uses proper cryptographic practices, handles errors gracefully, and maintains data integrity and confidentiality. No signs of malware or malicious anomalies.",
