  "purpose": "Implement a Fernet-like symmetric encryption and signing module for secure data encryption and decryption.",
  "sources": "os.urandom (key generation, IV), time.time() (timestamp), base64.urlsafe_b64decode/encode (key, token processing), struct.unpack/pack (timestamp handling), hmac.new (signature creation), Encrypter/Decrypter (AES encryption/decryption).",
  "sinks": "base64.urlsafe_b64decode/encode (input/output), hmac.compare_digest (signature verification), AESModeOfOperationCBC (encryption/decryption).",
  "flows": "Key is generated or provided, data is encrypted and signed, then encoded; during decryption, token is decoded, verified via timestamp and HMAC, then decrypted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard cryptographic libraries with proper key handling; no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors; no malicious network activity; uses secure random and HMAC; no obfuscation or hidden code present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a symmetric encryption scheme similar to Fernet, with proper key validation, timestamping, HMAC signing, and secure random IV generation. It correctly handles encoding/decoding, timestamp validation with skew allowance, and integrity checks. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified. Uses standard cryptographic practices and library functions appropriately. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or sabotage activities. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a secure token mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a Fernet-like encryption and signing module, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows standard cryptographic practices without suspicious behaviors. No malware detected.",
