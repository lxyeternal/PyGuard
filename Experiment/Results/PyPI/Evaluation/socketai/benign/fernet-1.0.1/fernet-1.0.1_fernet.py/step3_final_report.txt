  "purpose": "Implements a Fernet-like symmetric encryption scheme with key generation, encryption, and decryption functionalities, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for encryption, reads system time for timestamping, reads cryptographic keys during initialization, reads base64-encoded tokens during decryption.",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted tokens, raises exceptions on invalid tokens, compares HMAC digests for integrity verification.",
  "flows": "Input data -> encrypt() -> _encrypt_from_parts() -> AES encryption + HMAC -> output token; token -> decrypt() -> base64 decode -> HMAC verification -> AES decryption -> plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard cryptographic libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements a Fernet-like scheme with proper key handling, timestamp validation, HMAC integrity, and AES CBC encryption. It uses secure random generation and standard cryptographic primitives. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The cryptographic practices follow best standards, and the code structure is clear and straightforward. The security measures, including timestamp validation and HMAC comparison, are appropriate. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's design and implementation are consistent with secure cryptographic modules.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a secure, standard implementation of a Fernet-like cryptographic scheme with no detected malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and appropriate given the code's correctness and adherence to cryptographic best practices.",
