{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a Fernet-like symmetric encryption and signing scheme for secure data encryption and decryption.",
  "sources": "Input data: data parameter in encrypt(), token parameter in decrypt(), environment variables in os.urandom() and os.urandom().",
  "sinks": "HMAC digest comparison, base64 encoding/decoding, encryption/decryption with AES CBC mode.",
  "flows": "Data is encrypted, signed with HMAC, and encoded for encrypt; during decrypt, data is decoded, verified with HMAC, and decrypted.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard cryptographic primitives; no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors; no suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Fernet-like encryption scheme with proper key handling, HMAC verification, and timestamp validation to prevent replay. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of environment variables is for cryptographically secure random generation. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code structures are detected. The code appears consistent with secure cryptographic practices, assuming correct use.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard, secure symmetric encryption and signing operations without signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a benign implementation of a Fernet-compatible scheme.",
