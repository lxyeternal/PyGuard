{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated protobuf schema for gNMI, defining message types, enums, and registration logic for network management data serialization.",
  "sources": "Embedded serialized descriptor data, protobuf module imports, and generated message type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data sinks, external input processing, or network operations; purely static schema definitions.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or processing at runtime, only message serialization structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf generated module for gNMI, including message types, enums, and registration. It contains typical embedded descriptor data and no active logic or external data handling. All signals point to benign, auto-generated schema code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated protobuf schema for gNMI with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat and is safe for use.",
