  "purpose": "Importing gRPC protocol buffer modules related to gNMI and gNMI extensions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing local modules: gnmi_pb2, gnmi_pb2_grpc, gnmi_ext_pb2, gnmi_ext_pb2_grpc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports local modules related to gNMI protocol buffers and gRPC stubs. There is no data processing, network activity, or execution logic. The import statement appears standard for a Python project that uses generated protocol buffer code for gRPC communication. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for gRPC modules related to gNMI, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
