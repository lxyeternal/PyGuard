  "purpose": "Importing protocol buffer modules for gNMI and gNMI extension gRPC services",
  "sources": "Import statement importing modules from the current package",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since only import statements are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code activities; simple import statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for modules related to gNMI protocol buffers and gRPC extensions. These modules are likely auto-generated from protobuf definitions and are used for network management data serialization and remote procedure calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or external communications are present. The code appears to be a straightforward import of necessary components for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a basic import statement for protocol buffer modules and gRPC services. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is very low.",
