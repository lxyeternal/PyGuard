{
  "purpose": "Defines connector classes for Data Model Interfaces (DMI) including Netconf, Gnmi, and Grpc wrappers, along with metadata.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__version__, __author__, __contact__, __copyright__), and import statements for local modules (.netconf, .gnmi, .grpc, and xpath_util).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data output detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; primarily module import and metadata setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains metadata and import statements for internal modules related to network protocol wrappers. No code executes input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious functions or commands. It appears to be a straightforward module setup with public interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module initializer and metadata holder. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
