  "purpose": "Module initialization defining metadata and importing classes for Data Model Interfaces (DMI) connections.",
  "sources": "Static metadata definitions (__version__, __author__, etc.) and import statements from local modules (.netconf, .gnmi, .grpc, xpath_util).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no runtime data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; only static imports and metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setup with metadata and imports, with no dynamic execution, user input, or network activity. The imported modules are local and not executed here. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free from malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a safe assessment with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. Confidence is high (1.0).",
