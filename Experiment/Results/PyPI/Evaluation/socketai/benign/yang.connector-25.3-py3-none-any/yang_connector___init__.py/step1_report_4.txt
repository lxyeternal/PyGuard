{
  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import classes and functions related to Data Model Interface connectors (Netconf, Gnmi, gRPC).",
  "sources": "Static metadata definitions, import statements from local modules (.netconf, .gnmi, .grpc, and xpath_util).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; purely static code and module imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard module setup and metadata definitions with imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module metadata, author/contact information, and import statements for other modules. No user input handling, data processing, or dynamic execution present. All imports are local, and no functions execute code that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with metadata and imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign and standard component of a larger project.",
