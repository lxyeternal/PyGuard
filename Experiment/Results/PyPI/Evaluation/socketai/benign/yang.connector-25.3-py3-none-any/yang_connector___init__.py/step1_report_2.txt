{
  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import connection classes for Data Model Interfaces (DMI) such as Netconf, Gnmi, and Grpc, along with utility functions.",
  "sources": "Module metadata (__version__, __author__, __contact__, __copyright__), import statements for .netconf, .gnmi, .grpc modules, and xpath_util.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code consists of static definitions, imports, and metadata declarations without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata information and imports specific classes and functions from local modules. It imports Netconf, Gnmi, Grpc classes, and a utility module, then exposes these via __all__ for external use. There are no data processing, input/output handling, or external network interactions within this snippet. The module's purpose appears to be organizing and exporting connection classes for DMI, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This source code serves as a simple module setup and import/export mechanism. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
