{
  "purpose": "Defines modules and imports related classes for Data Model Interface (DMI) connections such as Netconf, Gnmi, and Grpc.",
  "sources": "Metadata definitions (__version__, __author__, __contact__, __copyright__), import statements for local modules (.netconf, .gnmi, .grpc, and xpath_util).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input or data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily consists of module metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The author list contains email addresses, but these are standard metadata fields.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module metadata and imports classes from local modules. It does not process user input, handle network data, or execute dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The import statements reference external packages (ncclient, grpcio, protobuf) but this is typical for a module relying on third-party libraries. No anomalies, secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module setup with metadata and imports, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
