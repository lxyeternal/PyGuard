{
  "purpose": "Defines module metadata and imports related classes for Data Model Interfaces (DMI) connection wrappers.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments (__version__, __author__, __contact__, __copyright__), import statements for netconf, gnmi, grpc modules, and xpath_util.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling are present. Imports are static and do not process external input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; all imports are static and module-level.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. No external data processing or network activity is initiated within this code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata and imports classes from other modules. It defines a list of exports (__all__). No runtime data handling, user input processing, or network operations are present that could lead to vulnerabilities. The import statements and metadata assignments are static. The overall structure is straightforward and does not contain suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with metadata and class imports, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, well-structured project with no embedded malware or security concerns.",
