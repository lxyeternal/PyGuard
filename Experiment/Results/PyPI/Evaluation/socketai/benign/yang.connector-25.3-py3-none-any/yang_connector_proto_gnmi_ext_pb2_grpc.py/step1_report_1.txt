  "purpose": "This code is a generated gRPC Python client and server stub based on protobuf service definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'grpc' module.",
  "sinks": "None present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths due to minimal code.",
  "anomalies": "Generated code with a clear comment indicating it is auto-generated; no suspicious behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal snippet containing only an import statement and a comment. It is typical for auto-generated gRPC code, which does not include executable logic or data handling. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present. There is no indication of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is safe and serves as a stub for gRPC communication based on protobuf definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an auto-generated gRPC stub with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be standard and safe, intended for use in gRPC service implementations.",
