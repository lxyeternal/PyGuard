{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated gRPC Python stub code, serving as boilerplate for protobuf-defined services.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import grpc' and comments indicating code generation; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code contains only import and comments with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable logic, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, auto-generated boilerplate with no malicious, suspicious, or security-sensitive elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign, boilerplate status. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and purpose as a stub indicate no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, auto-generated gRPC stub boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
