  "purpose": "Auto-generated gRPC client and server classes based on protobuf service definitions",
  "sources": "Import statement for grpc module",
  "sinks": "None present; no data handling or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module import and comment",
  "anomalies": "Generated code, standard comment indicating auto-generation, no suspicious or unusual code features",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal auto-generated stub for gRPC services, created by the protobuf compiler plugin. It imports the grpc library and contains a warning not to edit, indicating it is boilerplate code. There are no inputs, data handling, or security-sensitive operations within this snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure is typical for generated protocol buffer code.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard generated code with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as boilerplate for gRPC services, with no suspicious or anomalous elements.",
