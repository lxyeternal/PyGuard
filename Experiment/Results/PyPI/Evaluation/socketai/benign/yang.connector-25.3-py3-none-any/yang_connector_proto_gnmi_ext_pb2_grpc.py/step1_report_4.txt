  "purpose": "This code is a generated gRPC client and server stub for protobuf-defined services, used for communication between distributed systems.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'grpc' library and includes a comment indicating it was generated by the protobuf compiler plugin.",
  "sinks": "There are no identifiable sinks that process untrusted data, execute commands, or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this snippet; it mainly contains import statements and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual code segments. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present.",
