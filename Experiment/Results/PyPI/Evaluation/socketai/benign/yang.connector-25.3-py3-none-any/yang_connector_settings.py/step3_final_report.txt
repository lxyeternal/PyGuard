  "purpose": "A configuration class inheriting from dict, setting default parameters for logging and message sizes, enabling attribute access.",
  "sources": "Internal default value assignments within __init__, no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; only internal attribute setting.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of self.__dict__ = self for attribute-style access, a common pattern but potentially confusing; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward configuration class with default parameters, no external inputs, network activity, cryptography, or data leaks. The pattern of setting __dict__ is standard for flexible configs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration class with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis and scores are accurate and justified.",
