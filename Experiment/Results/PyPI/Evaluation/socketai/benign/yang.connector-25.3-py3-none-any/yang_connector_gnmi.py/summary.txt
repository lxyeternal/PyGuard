  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard gNMI client implementation for network device management. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation detected. The primary security concern is the optional 'skip_verify' SSL setting, which should be used cautiously. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.2)."
