{
  "purpose": "Generated gRPC client and server classes for the protobuf-defined gNMI service, serving as interface scaffolding.",
  "sources": "Imports grpc and gnmi_pb2 protobuf module; no untrusted input handling or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Serialization/deserialization of protobuf messages; no untrusted data sinks or system commands.",
  "flows": "gRPC request serialization, transmission, and response deserialization; server methods raise NotImplementedError, acting as placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "All server methods are unimplemented, raising NotImplementedError; no active logic, secrets, or malicious code; use of experimental gRPC API in static methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is autogenerated boilerplate for gNMI protocol, with no active logic, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The server methods are placeholders, typical for protocol stubs. Use of experimental gRPC features is noted but not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated gRPC interface for gNMI, with no malicious intent or security issues. The low risk and zero malware/obfuscation scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
