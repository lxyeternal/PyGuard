{
  "purpose": "The code provides gRPC client and server classes for gNMI protocol communication, enabling remote management of network devices.",
  "sources": "Imports the gRPC library and a generated protobuf module 'gnmi_pb2'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or system commands are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves setting up gRPC stubs, servicers, and methods for remote procedure calls with serialized protobuf messages.",
  "anomalies": "All methods raise 'NotImplementedError' with unimplemented status; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The code appears to be a generated skeleton, with no malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated gRPC interface for the gNMI protocol, including stub and servicer classes, along with helper functions to add servicers to a server. It uses standard gRPC patterns for request serialization and response deserialization. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. All methods are placeholders indicating unimplemented status, consistent with an autogenerated stub. No suspicious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard generated skeleton for gNMI protocol communication, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as an interface layer and does not contain any active malicious logic.",
