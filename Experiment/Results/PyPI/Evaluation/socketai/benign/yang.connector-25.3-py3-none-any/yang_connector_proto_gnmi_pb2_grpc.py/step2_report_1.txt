  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a generated gRPC skeleton for gNMI, with all server methods raising `NotImplementedError`. No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard auto-generated stub with no active logic, making it benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (since it's a skeleton, not operational, but still part of a management protocol).\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, auto-generated gRPC boilerplate with no custom logic or malicious code. All methods are placeholders.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; purely protocol interface.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (as it's a non-operational stub).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a generated gRPC interface with unimplemented methods, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** No active code or data handling, just interface definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—auto-generated, unimplemented methods, uses experimental gRPC features. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to experimental API usage.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, just a development or testing scaffold.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (due to experimental API, but not malicious).\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard boilerplate code for gNMI, with no active logic, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher due to being protocol code).\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe auto-generated gRPC interface code, with no active or malicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with benign, boilerplate code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.5 for unimplemented stubs, with slight variations for experimental or boilerplate code, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code is a non-operational stub, I would assign a **risk score of 0.5** for each, reflecting minimal operational risk but acknowledging the code's role as an interface layer.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.5\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation is present; the code is a standard, autogenerated gRPC interface for network device management.",
