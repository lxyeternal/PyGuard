  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes gRPC classes for gNMI, imported modules are standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; flow involves serialization/deserialization.\n- **Anomalies:** All methods raise 'NotImplementedError' with unimplemented status; no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a generated stub, benign, no active malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the report.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing auto-generated boilerplate, unimplemented methods, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: generated code, unimplemented methods, no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), mentions use of experimental gRPC features, but still no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — minimal, possibly due to experimental features, but not malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar boilerplate code, no active logic, unimplemented methods.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — very low, possibly due to the use of experimental features.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports confirm that the code is autogenerated, with no active logic, no data leaks, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** The only notable aspect is that all server methods are unimplemented, which is typical for autogenerated stubs.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 across all, correct given the straightforward, generated nature.\n  - **Security Risk:** Very low, with minor mentions of experimental features, but no actual risks.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is benign, a standard gRPC stub generated from protobuf definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, just boilerplate code.\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, autogenerated gRPC interface for gNMI with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
