  "purpose": "Define an Extension class that dynamically loads hooks and a manager class from a given module.",
  "sources": "Reading module.__dict__.items() to identify hooks and manager classes.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or external output. No direct data leaks or external commands.",
  "flows": "Accessing module.__dict__ to process attributes, then potentially adding hooks or setting a manager class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code. The dynamic attribute inspection is standard for plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Extension class intended for plugin management, loading hooks and a manager class from a module. It uses standard Python features like attribute iteration and class type checking. The code appears to be designed for extensibility without any malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, external network access, or hidden behaviors are present. The overall structure is typical for plugin or extension systems and does not exhibit signs of malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plugin extension loader with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for such a system.",
