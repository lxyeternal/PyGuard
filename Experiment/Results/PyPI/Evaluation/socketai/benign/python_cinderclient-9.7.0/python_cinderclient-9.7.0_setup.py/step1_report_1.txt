  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools and pbr.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the setuptools.setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only executes package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with minimal parameters. It specifies 'setup_requires' with 'pbr>=2.0.0' and enables 'pbr=True', which are standard configurations for Python package setup. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and serves a legitimate purpose in package distribution.",
