  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from importing setuptools to calling setuptools.setup() with predefined arguments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls its setup() function with setup_requires and pbr parameters. This is standard packaging configuration code. There are no input sources, no data sinks, and no flow of untrusted data. The code is straightforward and conventional for Python packaging. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package configuration using setuptools and pbr. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
