  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools and setup call with setup_requires and pbr parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard package setup script with proper licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools and pbr for packaging. The comments specify licensing under Apache 2.0. The setup call defines 'setup_requires' with a version constraint and enables pbr. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of user input, environment variables, or network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or secret handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for open-source Python packages.",
