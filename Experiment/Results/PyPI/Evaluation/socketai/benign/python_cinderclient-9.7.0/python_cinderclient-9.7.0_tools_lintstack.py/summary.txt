  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minimal security risk score reflects standard file and subprocess operations, which are typical for such tools. Therefore, the overall assessment is that the code is safe, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1)."
