  "purpose": "This script is designed to perform static analysis on Python code using pylint, generate and validate exception lists for pylint errors, and help maintain code quality and consistency.",
  "sources": "Reads code files (via open(filename)), command line arguments (sys.argv), and pylint output (via run_pylint function).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output (print), writes exception lists to a file (tools/pylint_exceptions), and reads from files (open).",
  "flows": "Reads source files during pylint error parsing, processes pylint output to identify error patterns, and writes/reads JSON exception data to/from files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The code performs standard static analysis tasks with no indication of malicious intent. Use of eval, exec, or network connections is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code implements pylint error parsing, exception management, and validation routines. It uses regex to parse pylint output, caches file content for efficiency, and manages exception lists in JSON format. All operations are related to code quality checks, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. The script does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious system modification. It is a legitimate static analysis utility, with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears well-structured for its purpose without malicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static analysis utility for managing pylint error exceptions and validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs file I/O and process execution in a controlled manner. The overall security risk is minimal.",
