  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the reported issues are valid, whether the logic and reasoning are sound, and if the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes for API error handling, parsing response headers and bodies, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no secrets, straightforward message formatting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is solid; the code is standard exception handling. The malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk is low, but since it involves response parsing, a slight caution (0.2) is acceptable. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on API error handling, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward exception classes, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent; no malicious patterns. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is minimal, given the code’s nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, no untrusted input processing or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is purely exception class definitions with response parsing, which is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard error handling classes.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is correct; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes and a response parser, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent; the code is a standard error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code only defines exception classes and response parsing logic.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0. The securityRisk scores are appropriately low, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the comprehensive review, **the code is entirely benign**. The scores across all reports are reasonable and justified. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module for API responses, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is very low risk.",
