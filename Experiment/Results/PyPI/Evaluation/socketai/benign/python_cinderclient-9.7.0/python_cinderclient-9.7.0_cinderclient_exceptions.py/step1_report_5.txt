{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling various error conditions and API response handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'datetime' and 'oslo_utils.timeutils'; Exception class constructors reading parameters and attributes; response headers and body parsing in 'from_response' function.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is written to files, network, or environment variables; no untrusted data is executed or injected.",
  "flows": "Input from response headers and body flows into exception objects via 'from_response'; exception data may be generated from untrusted response data, but only for error handling, not for executing code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes exception classes with descriptive messages and a helper function 'from_response' to generate exception instances based on HTTP response data. The exception classes handle typical HTTP error codes and related error conditions, with no code execution, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The use of response headers and body for error details is standard practice. No malicious patterns or malicious intent are evident. The code appears to be straightforward, focusing on error representation and handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception definitions and a response handler for API error processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and intended for robust error handling in API client libraries.",
