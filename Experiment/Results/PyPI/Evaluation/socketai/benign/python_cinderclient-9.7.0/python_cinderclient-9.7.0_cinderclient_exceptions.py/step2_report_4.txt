  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom exception classes for API/resource error handling.\n- Findings: No suspicious code, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation. Uses standard string formatting and safe parsing of headers.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified given the parsing of headers; still benign)\n- Conclusion: Benign, straightforward exception classes, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define error classes for API and system errors.\n- Findings: No anomalies, no suspicious code, no data leaks, no obfuscated code.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n- Conclusion: Standard error handling code, very low risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for API errors, timeouts, authorization.\n- Findings: No untrusted data processing beyond typical header/body parsing, no malicious patterns.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n- Conclusion: Typical, safe exception definitions, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Define error classes and response handling.\n- Findings: No anomalies, no obfuscation, no code execution, no data leaks.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n- Conclusion: Standard error handling module, very low risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for API error handling.\n- Findings: Straightforward, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n- Conclusion: Safe, typical error handling code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a set of exception classes for handling API and resource errors. The code involves parsing response headers and bodies to generate detailed error messages.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None of the reports or the code snippets show signs of malware, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The only somewhat complex behavior is parsing the 'Retry-After' header with datetime, which is standard and safe.\n- **Security Risks:** The overall security risk is very low, with no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n  - **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, but since the reports have assigned 0.2, that seems acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured exception handling module for API clients.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n- The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified.\n- The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1, but 0.2 remains acceptable given the context.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal parsing logic, but overall very safe)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior. The current scores are reasonable, and no further action is necessary.",
