{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in an API client or system, including network and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from response headers, response objects, and optional parameters such as body dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if response headers or body contents are improperly exposed or logged, but there are no explicit sinks in the code.",
  "flows": "Response headers and body data are used to instantiate exception objects; no complex data flow or untrusted data manipulation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code mostly defines exception classes and error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and API errors, including mechanisms to parse response headers and bodies to generate detailed exception messages. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling is present. The response processing is straightforward and based on standard API error response structures. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side-effects. Overall, the code appears to be a standard error handling module without security risks or malware. Its purpose is purely to facilitate error reporting within an API client context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error handling library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly defines exception classes and response parsing logic without any suspicious or malicious code. The likelihood of malware or malicious intent is very low.",
