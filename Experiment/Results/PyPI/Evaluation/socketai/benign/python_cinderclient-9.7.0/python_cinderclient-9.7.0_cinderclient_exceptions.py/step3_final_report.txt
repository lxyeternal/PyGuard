{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes for API and resource error handling, including response parsing and error messaging.",
  "sources": "Response headers ('x-compute-request-id', 'Retry-After') and response body data (error messages, details).",
  "sinks": "Error message construction; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Response headers and body data are used to generate exception messages; no external or untrusted code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Header parsing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes for handling API errors, timeouts, authorization, and other conditions. It safely formats messages, parses headers like 'Retry-After' with datetime, and processes response bodies for error details. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The parsing logic and message formatting are standard and secure. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), justified by the response header parsing but not indicative of any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes and response handlers for API error management. No malicious or suspicious features are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
