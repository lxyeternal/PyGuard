{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a software system, including handling API errors, timeouts, and authorization issues.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`from datetime import datetime`, `from oslo_utils import timeutils`), class constructors, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows or untrusted input processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes and a response handling function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard exception class patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of exception class definitions and a function to create exception instances from HTTP responses. It imports standard and third-party libraries for datetime manipulation. Exception classes handle various error scenarios such as resource errors, timeouts, API version issues, and HTTP errors. The `from_response` function maps HTTP status codes to exception classes and processes response headers and bodies, which is standard practice for error handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or data leaks. All code appears to be straightforward and aligned with common error handling patterns in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of standard exception definitions and a response parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical error handling module, and there is no evidence of supply chain attacks or hidden malicious code.",
