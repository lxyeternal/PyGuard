{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, particularly related to API interactions and resource states.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or external data directly; exception messages are constructed internally.",
  "sinks": "Exception message strings, which are constructed from internal parameters and class attributes.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised and caught internally; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical system functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward exception class definitions and a response parser.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception class definitions for handling various error scenarios, including HTTP errors, resource states, and API version issues. The 'from_response' function maps HTTP responses to exception instances, using response headers and body data to populate error details. All message content is generated from internal parameters or safe response data; no input sanitization concerns or malicious code patterns are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or execute any dynamically generated code. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The overall structure is standard for API error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception classes for API error handling without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities, nor does it contain malicious or obfuscated code segments. Overall security risk is very low.",
