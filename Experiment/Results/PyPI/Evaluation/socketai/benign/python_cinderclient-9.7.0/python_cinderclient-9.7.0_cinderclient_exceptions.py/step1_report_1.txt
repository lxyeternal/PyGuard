  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python client library, mainly for API interactions and resource management.",
  "sources": "Import of datetime module and oslo_utils.timeutils, class initializations, and string formatting for exception messages.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in exception messages and the from_response function that constructs exceptions based on API responses.",
  "flows": "Input from response object to exception class, message, and details assignment; string formatting in exception messages; potential data flow from response headers and body.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime parsing in OverLimit class to interpret 'Retry-After' headers; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard exception class definitions with typical error handling logic. It uses safe string formatting and normal API response processing. No external inputs are used insecurely, and there are no suspicious data flows. The exception handling logic and message construction follow standard patterns. The only potentially notable behavior is parsing 'Retry-After' headers with datetime, which is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes intended for API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of headers and response parsing is typical and safe. Overall, the code is benign with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
