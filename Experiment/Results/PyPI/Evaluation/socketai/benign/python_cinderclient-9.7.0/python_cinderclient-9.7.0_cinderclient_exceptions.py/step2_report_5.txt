  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the code defines standard exception classes for API error handling, with safe string formatting and response parsing.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The only notable behavior is parsing 'Retry-After' headers with datetime, which is standard.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; no signs of malicious code. Security risk is low (~0.2), considering potential misconfigurations but nothing malicious.\n- **Verdict:** The report's assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a typical error handling module with safe response processing.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious data flows, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns. The response parsing logic is standard.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is correct; no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Verdict:** The report is consistent; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward set of exception classes for API error handling, with safe message construction.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The code only constructs exception messages from internal data.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified; no malicious code or malware indicators.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes and a response parser, with no untrusted data processing beyond standard error handling.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is typical for error handling.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; no malware detected.\n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, the code defines exception classes and a response handler, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0; the code is benign.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to potential misconfigurations, but overall very safe)\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain risk from this code is negligible. It is a typical error handling library with no security concerns.",
