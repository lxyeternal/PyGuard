  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code defines exception classes, including `TimeoutException`, `ResourceInErrorState`, and `OverLimit`, which parse headers like 'Retry-After' using `datetime.strptime`. This is standard practice; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or flawed logic detected. String formatting is safe. The `OverLimit` class's parsing of 'Retry-After' is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Given the benign nature, these seem reasonable. Slightly elevated risk score due to header parsing is acceptable but not concerning.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code is standard for API error handling.\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on response parsing and exception classes. No signs of malicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; the code safely processes headers and body data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The low risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard error handling code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Defines exception classes and a `from_response` function, all standard. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Purely error handling, no malware or security concerns.\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar pattern—exception classes and response parsing.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, defining exceptions and response handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard error handling code.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports describe code that is a straightforward set of exception classes and response parsing functions, typical for API client libraries.\n- **Malware/malicious activity:** None detected across all reports. The code does not execute dynamic code, handle untrusted inputs insecurely, or contain obfuscated patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, the current scores are appropriate. The slightly elevated security risk score (around 0.2) in some reports is acceptable, but overall, the code is very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, due to header parsing, but no real security concern)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module for API responses, with no malicious or suspicious features. The current scores are reasonable, and I would not suggest any changes.\n\n---\n\n**Work through conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** ~0.1–0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
