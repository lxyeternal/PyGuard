  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exception classes for API error handling, with safe string formatting, parsing response headers, and body data. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — very low, as the code is purely for error handling.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is benign, standard, and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on error handling, parsing headers, and response bodies. No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is correct; no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for API errors, with internal message construction and response parsing. No suspicious code or data leaks.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — matches the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard error handling; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Exception classes and a response parser, with safe use of imported modules. No data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, defining exception classes and response handling, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code is purely for exception handling and response parsing, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk:** The highest risk score assigned is 0.2 in Report 1, which is reasonable given the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical set of exception classes for API error handling.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The parsing of headers and response bodies is standard practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident.\n- The overall security risk is very low.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
