  "purpose": "This code manages API version parsing, comparison, validation, and method versioning decorators to facilitate microversion support in an API client.",
  "sources": "Version strings provided during APIVersion instantiation, server responses, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings/exceptions, updating headers, raising exceptions, and method invocation.",
  "flows": "Input version strings -> APIVersion parsing -> comparison/validation -> method decorators -> header updates or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of float('inf') for latest version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for API version management, including parsing, comparison, validation, and method versioning decorators. It performs no network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of version strings and headers is typical for API clients. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The version comparison logic and exception handling are appropriate. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard API version handling library with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
