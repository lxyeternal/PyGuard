  "sources": "Environment variables via os.environ, resource managers, stevedore plugin loading, function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Resource retrieval, URL query string construction, plugin loading, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> env(); User input -> find_resource(); Plugin manager -> get_function_name(); URL params -> build_query_param().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of stevedore for plugin loading could be exploited if external plugins are malicious, but the code itself is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions used in CLI tools and plugin systems. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. Exception handling is appropriate. The use of stevedore introduces potential trust issues with plugins but does not constitute malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, with no suspicious logic or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent. The only concern is the plugin system's trustworthiness, which is inherent to plugin architectures. Scores are appropriate: malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.2.",
