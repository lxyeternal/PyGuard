  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns, focusing on supply chain security concerns.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, user input, data read from files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system calls, eval/exec functions, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or system modifications).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, suspicious imports or functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is generally straightforward with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of eval/exec in report 3, which introduces a security risk but no confirmed malicious activity. Other reports show benign code with no significant security issues. The scores reflect minimal threat, with slight increases for eval usage. The confidence in benign assessments is high, except for cautious evaluation of eval-related risks.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears safe with no active malicious behavior. The main point of concern is eval/exec usage, which warrants a slightly higher malware and security risk score. Adjustments are made to reflect this, increasing malware score in report 3 from 0.1 to 0.2 and security risk from 0.3 to 0.4. Other reports remain at low risk levels. The assessments are consistent with the observed code behavior and known security best practices.",
