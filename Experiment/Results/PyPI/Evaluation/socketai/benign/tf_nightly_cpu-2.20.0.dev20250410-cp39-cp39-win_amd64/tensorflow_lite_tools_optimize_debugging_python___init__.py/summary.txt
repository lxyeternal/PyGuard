  "conclusion": "Overall, the code appears safe with no active malicious behavior. The main point of concern is eval/exec usage, which warrants a slightly higher malware and security risk score. Adjustments are made to reflect this, increasing malware score in report 3 from 0.1 to 0.2 and security risk from 0.3 to 0.4. Other reports remain at low risk levels. The assessments are consistent with the observed code behavior and known security best practices."
