  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script or package module, but since no code is provided, the specific intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or external data modules; however, none are explicitly shown due to absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or system commands; no such sinks are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined without actual code. Typically, source-to-sink paths involve untrusted input being processed and then used insecurely, but no such flows are observable here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detectable due to lack of actual code.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no code for analysis. Therefore, no sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies can be identified. Without actual code content, assessment of security risks or malicious behavior is not feasible.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review; thus, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be identified. The evaluation is inconclusive due to absence of content.",
