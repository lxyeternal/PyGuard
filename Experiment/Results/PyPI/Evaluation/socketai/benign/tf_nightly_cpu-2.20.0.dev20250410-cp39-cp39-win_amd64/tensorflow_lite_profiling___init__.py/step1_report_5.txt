{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python module potentially intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user inputs via function parameters, and possibly external data sources such as files or network calls (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file write/read operations, or logging mechanisms where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or command injection.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, files) through intermediate processing, which could be exploited if inputs are not sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution found. However, any usage of eval or exec, if present, would be a concern, but none are detected here. No unusual imports or obfuscated patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to follow standard patterns without suspicious constructs. It utilizes safe standard libraries and functions. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The overall structure and variable naming do not suggest malicious intent. The only potential concern is if external data is used insecurely, but that cannot be confirmed without more context. No malware patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there is no indication of malicious behavior or malware in this code. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no evident security risks. Confidence is high in this assessment.",
