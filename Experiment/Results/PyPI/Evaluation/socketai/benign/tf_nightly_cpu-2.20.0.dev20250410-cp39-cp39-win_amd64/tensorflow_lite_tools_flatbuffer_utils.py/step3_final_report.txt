  "purpose": "Utility functions for TensorFlow Lite models, including parsing, conversion, manipulation, and model modifications such as weight randomization and byte swapping.",
  "sources": "Reads input files via gfile.Exists and gfile.GFile; reads model bytearrays; parses byte arrays into model objects.",
  "sinks": "Writes model bytearrays to output files; modifies model buffers and tensors in memory.",
  "flows": "Reads model files -> converts to model objects -> manipulates buffers/tensors -> serializes back to bytearrays -> writes to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.seed and random.uniform for weight randomization, which could be misused but is standard for testing; parsing C++ hex arrays with regex, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model handling tasks: reading, writing, byte swapping, renaming ops, stripping strings, and randomizing weights. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation patterns are present. Random seed usage is typical for testing or model manipulation, not malicious. Byte swapping and string stripping are common data processing operations. The parsing of C++ hex arrays is unconventional but legitimate for reconstructing model data. No embedded malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The malware score is consistent at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to potential misuse of weight randomization, which is a benign utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of utility functions for TensorFlow Lite model processing. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The operations are typical for model testing, conversion, and manipulation, with minimal security concern.",
