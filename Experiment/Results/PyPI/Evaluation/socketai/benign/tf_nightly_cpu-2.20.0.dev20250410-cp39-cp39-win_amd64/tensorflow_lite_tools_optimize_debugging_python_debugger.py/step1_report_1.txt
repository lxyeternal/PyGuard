{
  "purpose": "The code implements a debugging tool for TensorFlow Lite models, specifically for analyzing quantization effects and comparing float and quantized models during inference.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (quantized and float models), dataset generator for inputs, tensor details, and op details from interpreters.",
  "sinks": "Uses model files, tensor data, and op details internally; no direct untrusted data output or network communications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset generator to interpreters via set_tensor, then outputs are retrieved and processed; metrics are computed from tensor data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns observed. The code mainly focuses on model analysis and metrics collection. No obfuscated code, network connections, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a detailed implementation of a TensorFlow Lite model debugger focusing on quantization effects, with functions for setting inputs, retrieving outputs, and calculating metrics. It handles model conversion, calibration, and comparison between float and quantized models. No suspicious network activity, file writing outside of CSV export, or hidden behavior was detected. The code appears to be well-structured for its purpose and adheres to standard debugging practices without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging tool for TensorFlow Lite models, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely processes model data and metrics without any suspicious activities or malicious routines.",
