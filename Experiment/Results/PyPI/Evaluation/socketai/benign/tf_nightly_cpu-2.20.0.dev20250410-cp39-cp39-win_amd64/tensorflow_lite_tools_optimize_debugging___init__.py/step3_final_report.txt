  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters, dynamic execution functions ('exec', 'eval'), external imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, dynamic code execution, network functions, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into 'exec'/'eval' or network/file operations, possibly leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec'/'eval' with untrusted data, high obfuscation, non-standard imports, dynamic code evaluation, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicion. Benign reports show straightforward, well-structured code with no suspicious patterns. Suspicious reports employ obfuscation, dynamic execution, and untrusted data flows, indicating potential malicious intent. Scores assigned reflect these patterns: benign code scores are zero for malware and obfuscation, with low security risk; suspicious code scores are moderate to high, justified by obfuscation and dynamic features. Minor adjustments could slightly increase malware scores in reports with moderate suspicion, but overall, the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly assess the code's security posture. Benign code is accurately scored with zero malware and obfuscation. Suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution warrants higher scores (~0.6 malware, ~0.75 obfuscation, ~0.6 risk). Slight score adjustments could improve accuracy, but current assessments are largely appropriate.",
