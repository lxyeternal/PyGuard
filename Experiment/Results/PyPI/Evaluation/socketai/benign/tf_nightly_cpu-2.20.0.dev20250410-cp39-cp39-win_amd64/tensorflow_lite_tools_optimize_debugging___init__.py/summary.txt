  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly assess the code's security posture. Benign code is accurately scored with zero malware and obfuscation. Suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution warrants higher scores (~0.6 malware, ~0.75 obfuscation, ~0.6 risk). Slight score adjustments could improve accuracy, but current assessments are largely appropriate."
