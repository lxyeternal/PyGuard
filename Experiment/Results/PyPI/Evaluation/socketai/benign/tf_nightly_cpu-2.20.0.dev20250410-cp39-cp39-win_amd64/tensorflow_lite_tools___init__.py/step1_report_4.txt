  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger application. No explicit purpose is clearly indicated.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files (not specified in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, or system commands (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters to sinks like system commands or network calls, via intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code structure appears straightforward with standard library use.",
  "analysis": "The code has been reviewed thoroughly, including the start, middle, and end sections. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, obscure imports, or hidden network activity, are present. The use of third-party libraries seems benign, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or supply chain security risks. The code appears to be standard application logic with no malicious anomalies.",
