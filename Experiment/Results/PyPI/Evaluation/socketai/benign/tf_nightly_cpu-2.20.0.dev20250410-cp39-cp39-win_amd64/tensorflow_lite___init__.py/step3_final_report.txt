  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic execution functions (e.g., eval, exec), hardcoded strings, network or file operations, environment variable usage.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or code execution functions flow into sinks like network or file operations, potentially indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic code execution, high obfuscation, ambiguous control flow, hardcoded URLs or commands, suspicious variable names, unusual imports or function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates that reports lacking code (reports 1-4) appropriately assign low or zero scores due to insufficient evidence. Report 5 shows clear signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying high scores (malware 0.6, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.7). The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions and reasoning. No evidence suggests overestimation or underestimation of malicious intent. The overall suspicion is primarily driven by report 5's features, while others remain benign or unexamined.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or unreviewed, with scores appropriately low. Report 5 exhibits significant suspicious features, warranting high malware and obfuscation scores. The overall assessment indicates a moderate threat level primarily due to report 5's indicators. No adjustments are necessary; scores are consistent with the evidence.",
