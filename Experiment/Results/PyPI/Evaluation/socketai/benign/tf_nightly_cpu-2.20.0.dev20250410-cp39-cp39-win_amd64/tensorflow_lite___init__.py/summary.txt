  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or unreviewed, with scores appropriately low. Report 5 exhibits significant suspicious features, warranting high malware and obfuscation scores. The overall assessment indicates a moderate threat level primarily due to report 5's indicators. No adjustments are necessary; scores are consistent with the evidence."
