  "conclusion": "The code shows minimal malicious intent with some potential misuse of network and subprocess modules. Scores are generally appropriate; a slight increase in malware and security risk scores for report 5 is justified. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants cautious review if untrusted inputs are involved."
