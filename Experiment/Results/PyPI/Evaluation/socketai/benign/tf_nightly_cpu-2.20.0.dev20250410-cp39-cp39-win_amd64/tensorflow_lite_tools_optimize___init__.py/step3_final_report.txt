  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input reading from environment variables, network sockets, subprocess calls, user input, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (socket, requests), subprocess execution, environment variable access, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, socket data, or user input flow into network transmission, subprocess commands, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential suspicious usage of socket and subprocess modules, moderate suspicion scores, no obfuscation detected, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment variable access, network communication, subprocess execution, and data handling. No obfuscation or clear malicious patterns are present. Suspicious signals include socket and subprocess usage, which could be exploited maliciously, but no concrete malicious activity is confirmed. Malware scores are low (around 0.2-0.3), justified by the potential for misuse. Security risk scores are mostly low (0.2), with a slight increase in report 5 (0.4) due to network and subprocess usage. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting cautious suspicion but lack of definitive malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows minimal malicious intent with some potential misuse of network and subprocess modules. Scores are generally appropriate; a slight increase in malware and security risk scores for report 5 is justified. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants cautious review if untrusted inputs are involved.",
