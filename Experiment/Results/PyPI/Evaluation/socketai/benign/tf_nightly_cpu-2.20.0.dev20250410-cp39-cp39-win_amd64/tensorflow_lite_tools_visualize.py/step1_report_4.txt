{
  "purpose": "This script generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model by parsing Flatbuffer files or objects and rendering graph structures with embedded D3.js visualizations.",
  "sources": "File input from the specified .tflite, .bin, or .json files; data read from model files and JSON deserialization; environment variables indirectly via standard library functions; standard library functions and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Writing the generated HTML visualization to a specified output file; embedding D3.js visualization scripts into the HTML output.",
  "flows": "Model data is read from files or objects, parsed into dictionaries, then converted into JSON for visualization; visualization scripts and HTML are generated and written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code primarily reads model files and generates HTML; no external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads model files (.tflite, .bin, .json) from disk, converts Flatbuffer models into Python dictionaries without executing any untrusted code. It then produces an HTML page embedding D3.js scripts to visualize the model graph. No user inputs, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are detected. The usage of environment variables is standard and limited to module imports. All file handling is safe and straightforward. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The only concern might be if the input files are maliciously crafted to exploit deserialization or parsing libraries, but this is a common risk and not specific to this code.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It securely reads model files, processes data, and generates HTML visualizations without external communication or hidden behaviors.",
