{
  "purpose": "This script generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model, including graph visualization and model details.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (.tflite, .json) from disk; loads and parses these files; reads environment variables; uses os.path and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated HTML output to a specified file; uses JSON serialization; executes dynamically generated JavaScript code for visualization.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from disk or object; processes and converts to dict; generates HTML and JavaScript code; writes HTML to output file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic string formatting for embedding JSON data into JavaScript; includes external script sources (d3.js) without validation; minimal sanitization of model data before embedding.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads TensorFlow Lite model files (.tflite, .json), parses them into dictionaries, and generates an HTML visualization. It dynamically embeds model data into HTML/JavaScript templates for visualization purposes. It reads input files directly from disk with standard open/read operations. It writes the generated HTML to a specified output file. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or backdoors are present. The code dynamically generates JavaScript code based on model data but does not execute untrusted code or commands. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads. The external script source (d3.js) is standard for visualization. The embedding of JSON data into scripts is done via string formatting but without evident sanitization issues; however, this is typical for visualization scripts and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate TensorFlow Lite visualization tool. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It reads model files, processes them into a visualization, and outputs an HTML file. There are no signs of malware or security risks. The only minor concern is the embedding of data into JavaScript without sanitization, but this is standard for such visualization scripts.",
