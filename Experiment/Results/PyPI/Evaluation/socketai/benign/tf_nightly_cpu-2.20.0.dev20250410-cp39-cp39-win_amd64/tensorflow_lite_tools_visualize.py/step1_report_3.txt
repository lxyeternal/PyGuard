{
  "purpose": "The script generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model, including graphs, tables, and detailed subgraph information.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (.tflite, .json) from disk, including reading binary data from files specified by the user. No other data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Writes an HTML file to disk specified by the user. Uses dynamic HTML and JavaScript generation for visualization. No network or external system calls detected.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from files or objects, converts to dictionaries, and generates HTML content. The HTML and embedded JavaScript visualize model structure without executing or executing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets. The code only processes model files and produces visualization outputs. The JavaScript code for visualization is standard d3.js code, with no obfuscated or malicious logic. No use of eval or dynamic code execution beyond standard d3.js visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O operations to load TensorFlow Lite models, converts flatbuffer data into dictionaries, and generates static HTML+JavaScript for visualization purposes. No network connections, no data exfiltration, no credential handling, or malicious system modifications are present. It relies on standard libraries, and the embedded JavaScript is for visualization only. No anomalies, hidden functions, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign tool for visualizing TensorFlow Lite models. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Its purpose is to produce visualization HTML from model files. The overall security risk score is very low.",
