{
  "purpose": "This script creates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite graph by parsing model files or objects and generating interactive visualizations with embedded JavaScript.",
  "sources": "Reads model files (.tflite, .bin, .json) from disk, and data embedded into HTML/JavaScript templates.",
  "sinks": "Embedding of JSON data into JavaScript code without sanitization, but this is standard for visualization tools and does not lead to code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads model files -> Converts flatbuffer data into dictionaries -> Embeds data into HTML/JavaScript templates -> Generates visualization in browser.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. External dependencies are standard visualization libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file I/O, data parsing, and HTML/JavaScript generation for visualization. It does not execute dynamic code, connect to networks, or contain malicious payloads. External libraries are standard, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are present. Embedding data into JavaScript is typical for such tools and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard visualization utility for TensorFlow Lite models. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified given its purpose and implementation.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
