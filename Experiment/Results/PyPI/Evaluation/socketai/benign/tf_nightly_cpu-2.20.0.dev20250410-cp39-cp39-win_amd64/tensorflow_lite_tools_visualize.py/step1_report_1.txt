{
  "purpose": "The script generates an HTML visualization of a TensorFlow Lite model by parsing flatbuffer files or model objects and creating interactive graph and table representations.",
  "sources": "Reads input file paths for .tflite, .bin, or .json files; reads model data from these files; loads JSON data; reads environment variables and system parameters when processing files.",
  "sinks": "Writes HTML output to specified file; includes dynamic HTML/JavaScript generation that could execute in a browser context.",
  "flows": "Reads model data from input files, parses and converts into nested dictionaries, then generates HTML with embedded JSON for visualization, which is written to output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of external D3.js library is standard for visualization. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. No network activity or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs file I/O, JSON parsing, data transformation, and HTML/JavaScript code generation for visualization purposes. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or malicious data handling. The use of external libraries like D3.js is common for visualization. No signs of data exfiltration, system compromise, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern could be the handling of untrusted input files, but this is typical for a visualization tool and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate use.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a visualization tool for TensorFlow Lite models, with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. It processes model files and generates interactive HTML visualizations. No security risks or malicious activities are evident in the code.",
