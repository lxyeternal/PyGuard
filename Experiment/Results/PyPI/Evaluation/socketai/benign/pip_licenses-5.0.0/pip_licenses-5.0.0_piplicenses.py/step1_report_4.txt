{
  "purpose": "This script is a license auditing tool for Python packages installed via pip. It extracts package metadata, license information, and formats the data into various output styles for review.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using importlib.metadata, reads included license and notice files from package directories, and parses command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data sources include user-provided command-line arguments and package metadata, which are formatted into output formats (JSON, CSV, etc.) and written to files or stdout.",
  "flows": "User inputs (arguments) influence configuration; package metadata and included files are read and processed; data is then formatted into tables or JSON and outputted or saved to files.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a license management tool. It performs file reading, subprocess calls to get sys.path, and data formatting. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs license metadata extraction and output formatting with thorough argument parsing and file handling. The subprocess call to retrieve sys.path is used for package discovery. No dynamic code execution or network activity is observed. The code's structure is consistent with a well-documented CLI utility. No signs of malicious backdoors, data theft, or harmful system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate license management utility with no apparent malicious intent. It reads package metadata and files, formats output, and handles user inputs securely. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware indicators.",
