  "purpose": "A utility to extract and report license and package metadata information from installed Python packages, including license files, authors, URLs, and license classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata via importlib.metadata, license files from package directories, and executes subprocess to retrieve sys.path from specified Python interpreter.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted license and package info to stdout or files; no data leaks or malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Package metadata and license files are read; subprocess call executes external Python to get environment sys.path; data is formatted and outputted.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to invoke Python code for environment info; no obfuscation or malicious code detected; no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script performs license and metadata extraction using standard Python libraries and subprocess for environment inspection. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The subprocess call, while potentially exploitable if misused, is a controlled pattern for environment detection and is not malicious in this context. No network activity or data exfiltration is observed. The code is well-structured, with clear logic and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate license inspection utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The subprocess call for environment introspection is standard and controlled, contributing only a minimal security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, which is justified by the subprocess usage but not indicative of malicious intent.",
