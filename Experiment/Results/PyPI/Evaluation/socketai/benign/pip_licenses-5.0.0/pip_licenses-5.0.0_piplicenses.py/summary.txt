  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate license inspection utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The subprocess call for environment introspection is standard and controlled, contributing only a minimal security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, which is justified by the subprocess usage but not indicative of malicious intent."
