{
  "purpose": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting up extensions, themes, and output options without executing any dynamic or external code.",
  "sources": "No untrusted sources; only static assignment of configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the script does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for documentation setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard modules (`sys`, `os`) and sets configuration parameters for Sphinx documentation. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network communication, or data processing. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All indicators point to a benign, static configuration file with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, risk score is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
