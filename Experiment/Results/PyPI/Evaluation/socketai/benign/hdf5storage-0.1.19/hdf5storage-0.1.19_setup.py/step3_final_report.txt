  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'hdf5storage', managing dependencies, environment checks, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description; imports 'setuptools' or fallback 'ez_setup'; checks Python version; defines dependencies based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, data leaks, or code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> performs environment checks -> sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of outdated 'ez_setup' fallback, but not malicious; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with environment checks, dependency management, and package metadata. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code is present. The fallback to 'ez_setup' is an outdated compatibility measure, not malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or code injection is observed. The dependency specifications are standard and platform-specific. Overall, the script is benign and intended solely for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and typical setup process.",
