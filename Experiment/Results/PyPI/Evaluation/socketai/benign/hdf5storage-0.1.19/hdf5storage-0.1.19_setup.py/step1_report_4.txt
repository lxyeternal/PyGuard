  "purpose": "Setup script for the hdf5storage Python package, handling dependencies, version checks, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (sys.hexversion), reads README.rst file, and gathers package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flows from sources to sinks; primarily standard setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. The code performs typical setup and dependency handling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks for Python version compatibility and handles optional dependencies with fallback mechanisms. It reads a README file for long description content. Package metadata and dependencies are specified in a standard manner. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations are evident. The code is consistent with common package setup routines and contains no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
