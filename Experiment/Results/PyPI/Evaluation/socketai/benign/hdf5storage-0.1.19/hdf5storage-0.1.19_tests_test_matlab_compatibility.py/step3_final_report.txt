  "purpose": "This code automates testing of MATLAB and Python data exchange by running MATLAB scripts, loading .mat files, and verifying data integrity between MATLAB and Python representations.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls to run MATLAB scripts; loading .mat files via scipy.io and hdf5storage.",
  "sinks": "Data loaded from files; no untrusted input or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Static subprocess commands execute MATLAB scripts; loaded data is compared via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling that suppresses errors; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled testing utility for MATLAB-Python data validation, using static commands and standard libraries. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is broad but typical for test scripts. The subprocess calls are static, reducing risk. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script for MATLAB-Python data exchange with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
