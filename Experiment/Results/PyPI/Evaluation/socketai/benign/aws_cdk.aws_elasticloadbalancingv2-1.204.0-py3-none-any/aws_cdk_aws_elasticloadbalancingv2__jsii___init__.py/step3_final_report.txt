{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an AWS CDK module by importing necessary libraries, loading a specific JSII assembly for aws-elasticloadbalancingv2, and publishing the module metadata.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, the jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() call, and the publication.publish() function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and assembly loading occur at startup; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and lacks obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script for AWS CDK constructs, performing imports, loading a JSII assembly, and publishing metadata. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code's purpose is clear and standard for infrastructure as code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The high confidence score (near 1) is justified given the static, well-understood nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AWS CDK setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, indicating no significant security concern.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
