{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and load AWS CDK modules related to elastic load balancing, setting up necessary imports and assembly loading for infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'jsii.JSIIAssembly.load' which loads a specific AWS CDK JSII assembly.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "The assembly loading is a static operation with no data flow from external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of imports and a single assembly load call for an AWS CDK module. All imported modules are standard, well-known AWS CDK packages. The load function references a specific JSII assembly related to AWS Elastic Load Balancing, with versioning details. The code concludes with a publish call and a simple export list. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No network activity or hidden behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a typical setup script for AWS CDK deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard infrastructure setup script for AWS CDK, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe based on its content.",
