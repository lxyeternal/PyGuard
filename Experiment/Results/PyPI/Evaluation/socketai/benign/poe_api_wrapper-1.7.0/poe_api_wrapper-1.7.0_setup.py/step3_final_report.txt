{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'poe-api-wrapper' library, configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or runtime data handling present; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration with no source-to-sink data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks without dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling untrusted input. Dependencies are standard packages. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code's static nature and reliance on local files indicate a benign purpose. All security signals point to a safe, well-structured package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
