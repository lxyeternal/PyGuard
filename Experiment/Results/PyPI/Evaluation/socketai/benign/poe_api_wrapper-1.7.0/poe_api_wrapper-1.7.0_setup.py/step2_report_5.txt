  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools` to configure a Python package named `poe-api-wrapper`.\n   - It reads a `README.md` for the long description.\n   - Defines package metadata, dependencies, extras, classifiers, and entry points.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input at runtime.\n   - All dependencies are standard, and no suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Analysis:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n   - No external untrusted data sources are read or written at runtime.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity or handle sensitive data dynamically.\n   - Dependencies are common and relevant for the package's purpose.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting the minimal risk inherent in a package setup script, which is standard and safe.\n\n4. **Any Issues or Discrepancies?**\n   - The code is standard and does not contain any suspicious elements.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; conclusions are based on the code's static analysis.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is safe, well-structured, and typical for Python package setup.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity or security flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (confirmed safe)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the nature of the code, a higher risk score is unwarranted. The package appears secure for distribution and use.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
