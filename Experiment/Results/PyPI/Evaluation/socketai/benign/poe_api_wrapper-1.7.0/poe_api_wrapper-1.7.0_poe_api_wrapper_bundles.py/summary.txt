  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate web scraping and token extraction utility. While it involves external scripts and dynamic JavaScript evaluation, there is no evidence of malicious intent or payloads. The main risk stems from executing untrusted external scripts, which could be exploited if sources are compromised. Overall, the code is safe but should incorporate validation or sandboxing for external scripts to mitigate potential risks."
