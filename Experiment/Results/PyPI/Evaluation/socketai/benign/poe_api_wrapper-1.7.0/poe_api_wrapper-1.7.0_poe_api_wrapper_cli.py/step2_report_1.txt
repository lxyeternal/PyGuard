  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code to evaluate the presence of issues, reasoning accuracy, and scoring consistency.\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Security Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that accepts tokens via command-line arguments, constructs a dictionary, and passes it to an external class (`PoeExample`) for further processing.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The version is retrieved dynamically from package metadata, which is standard.\n   - The tokens are supplied at runtime, minimizing risk of secret exposure.\n   - The actual API interaction and potential malicious behavior would depend on the implementation of `poe_api_wrapper.PoeExample`, which isn't provided. However, based on this snippet alone, there's no indication of malicious code or backdoors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Issues:**\n   - No evident errors or flaws in the logic.\n   - The code handles optional parameters gracefully.\n   - The reasoning in all reports correctly interprets the code as a benign CLI wrapper.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n\n3. **Score Evaluation & Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is accurate.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, which seems reasonable given the minimal risk of this wrapper code itself. The risk depends on the external library's implementation, but within this snippet, the score is appropriately low.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume `PoeExample.chat_with_bot()` and the external library are secure. Since we cannot verify that here, the scores reflect that uncertainty.\n   - No claims are made about hidden malicious behavior; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the code snippet, I agree with the assigned scores:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0.1–0.2 (low, based on minimal code and external dependencies)\n\n6. **My Final Estimation:**\n   - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk:** 0.15 (low, due to reliance on external library; minimal risk in this snippet)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign CLI wrapper for an API client, with no evident security issues or malicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and justified. The actual security posture depends on the external `poe_api_wrapper` library, but within this snippet, there are no concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep the security risk score low (~0.15).\n- No further action needed based solely on this code snippet.",
