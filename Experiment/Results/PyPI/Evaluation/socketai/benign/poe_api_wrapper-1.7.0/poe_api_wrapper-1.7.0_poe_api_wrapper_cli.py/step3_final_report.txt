  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper that accepts API tokens and optional form key, then passes them to an external PoeExample class for chat interactions.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for tokens (-b, -lat, -f), package metadata for version info.",
  "sinks": "Tokens are passed to PoeExample.chat_with_bot(), external API calls depend on PoeExample implementation.",
  "flows": "CLI arguments -> tokens dictionary -> PoeExample(tokens).chat_with_bot()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface collecting tokens at runtime, passing them to an external class for API interaction. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The security and behavior depend on the external PoeExample class and poe_api_wrapper library, which are outside this snippet. The code handles input securely by not hardcoding secrets and does not perform any suspicious operations. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified given the minimal code and runtime token handling. External dependencies' security should be verified separately, but within this snippet, there are no concerns.",
