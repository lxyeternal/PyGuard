{
  "purpose": "Initialize and start a local server for a language model API using provided tokens, address, and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: tokens (dict), address (str), and port (str). It also conditionally imports 'start_server' from a local package.",
  "sinks": "The 'start_server' function, invoked with sensitive tokens and network parameters, could potentially be a sink if malicious. The logger records errors, but no data leaks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Tokens are passed to 'start_server', which may be a source of sensitive data flow if malicious. The function is called during object initialization, with errors logged and raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed. The conditional import and server start are typical patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to set up a server using provided tokens and network settings. The import of 'start_server' is conditional, allowing flexibility. The server startup occurs in the constructor, with error handling via logging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The usage of tokens in 'start_server' is standard for server initialization. No suspicious patterns, data exfiltration, or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard server initialization pattern with no evident malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely handles errors via logging and does not expose or leak sensitive data beyond legitimate usage. Overall, it appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
