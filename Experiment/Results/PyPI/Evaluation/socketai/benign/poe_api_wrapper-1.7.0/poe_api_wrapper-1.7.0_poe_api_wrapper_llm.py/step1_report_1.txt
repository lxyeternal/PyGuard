{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and starts a local server for a language model API, handling imports and exceptions.",
  "sources": "The tokens parameter provided to the __init__ method and the import of start_server from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The start_server function, which may initiate network operations or server processes with provided tokens and address.",
  "flows": "Tokens and address flow into start_server, which is invoked during class instantiation; error handling logs failures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible; the code imports from a local module, which could hide malicious behavior but is not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a local module and sets a flag based on import success. It defines a class PoeServer that takes tokens, address, and port as parameters. During initialization, it calls start_server with these parameters and logs any errors. No suspicious code or obfuscated logic is present. The usage appears to be standard for setting up a local server, assuming start_server is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward server setup with standard exception handling. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The potential concern is reliance on a local module which could hide malicious code, but based on this fragment alone, no malicious intent is apparent.",
