  "purpose": "Initialize and start a server using provided tokens, address, and port, with error logging.",
  "sources": "Tokens parameter passed to start_server; import of start_server from local module",
  "sinks": "start_server function call with tokens and network parameters",
  "flows": "Tokens and network info flow from class instantiation to start_server call",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of start_server; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard server setup with exception handling and conditional import. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident. The reliance on an external function whose internal behavior is unknown is noted but not suspicious. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's transparency and simplicity. The confidence level is high due to code clarity. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects reliance on external code, but no evidence indicates malicious behavior. The overall assessment is justified and consistent with the code snippet.",
