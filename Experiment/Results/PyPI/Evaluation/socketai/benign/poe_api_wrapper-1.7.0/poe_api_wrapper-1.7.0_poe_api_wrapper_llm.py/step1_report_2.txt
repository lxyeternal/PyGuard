  "purpose": "Initialize and start a local server for processing, using provided tokens and network configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'tokens' parameter passed to the __init__ method; importing the start_server function from the openai.api module.",
  "sinks": "Calling start_server, which may initiate network activity or server processes; logging errors with logger.error.",
  "flows": "Tokens received as input -> start_server invoked with tokens, address, and port -> potential network/server setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports or code behaviors. The import fallback is standard. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and attempts to import a module for API handling. If unavailable, it sets a flag. The PoeServer class constructor takes tokens and network info, then calls start_server. Error handling logs failures. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity within this snippet. The start_server function's internal behavior cannot be assessed here but its invocation is typical for server setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward server initialization class with no evident malicious intent. It depends on an external start_server function, which could be reviewed separately for security. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors are observed in this snippet.",
