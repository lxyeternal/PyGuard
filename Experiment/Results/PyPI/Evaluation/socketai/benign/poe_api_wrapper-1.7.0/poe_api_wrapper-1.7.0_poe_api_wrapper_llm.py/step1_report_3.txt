  "purpose": "Initialize and start a local server for a language model or API service using provided tokens, address, and port.",
  "sources": "Tokens are provided as input to start_server; address and port are parameters used in server startup.",
  "sinks": "start_server function call is the main sink where untrusted data could potentially influence server behavior.",
  "flows": "Tokens -> start_server; address and port -> start_server; exception handling logs errors if server fails to start.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code conditionally imports a module, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports a local module 'openai.api' to start a server with tokens, address, and port. It logs errors if startup fails. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. The tokens are passed directly to start_server, which is a typical pattern for server initialization. No external network connections, data leaks, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward server initializer with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It relies on an external 'start_server' function whose behavior is assumed to be standard. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
