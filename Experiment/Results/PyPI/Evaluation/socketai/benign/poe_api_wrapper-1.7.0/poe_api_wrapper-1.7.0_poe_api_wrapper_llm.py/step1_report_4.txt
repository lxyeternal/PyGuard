{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a server for the Poe application using provided tokens and network settings.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'tokens' parameter and environment during import; reads tokens, address, port in constructor.",
  "sinks": "Uses start_server() which may handle data internally; logs errors with logger.error().",
  "flows": "Tokens provided to start_server() directly from constructor argument; no untrusted input flows explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard exception handling; no suspicious imports beyond normal dependencies; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a local module for starting a server and defines a class to initialize the server with given tokens and network parameters. Error handling is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. The use of loguru for logging is standard. The code appears to be a typical server startup routine without malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward server initialization class with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It handles import failures gracefully and logs errors appropriately. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are observed.",
