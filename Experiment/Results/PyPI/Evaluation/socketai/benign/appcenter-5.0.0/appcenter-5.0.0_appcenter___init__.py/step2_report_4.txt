  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API wrapper class.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified.\n- The access token is received as a parameter, stored, and passed to client instances, which is standard practice.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is observed within this snippet.\n- The imports are standard, and the code structure is clear and conventional.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a simple, standard wrapper with no evident bugs or security flaws.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** The only potential concern is passing an access token, but this is typical for API wrappers, and no mishandling is evident.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical or security flaws.\n- The code is well-structured, with proper logging and dependency injection.\n- No issues are apparent in the logic or implementation.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 in the reports, which seems reasonable given the code's purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since the code is a simple API wrapper, the **malware score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **security risk score** can be slightly above 0 (say 0.1) because it involves handling an access token, which if mishandled elsewhere, could pose risks. But within this snippet, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; no changes needed.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely structural.\n- The scores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects that the code is a benign, standard API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk inherent in its design.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-implemented API client wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
