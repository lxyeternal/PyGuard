{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around the App Center app APIs for managing users, teams, and collaborators within an organization and app context.",
  "sources": "Reads include function parameters (org_name, app_name, user_email, role, permission), URL generation functions, and response.json().",
  "sinks": "HTTP methods (http_get, http_post, http_delete, http_patch) that send data to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct URLs and request data, which are then sent via HTTP methods. Response data is deserialized but not directly used for further processing within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; URL construction is based on input parameters; no evident data leaks or malicious code. Logging info appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API wrapper functions: URL generation, HTTP requests, and response handling. There are no signs of malicious activities like data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Input parameters are used solely for URL and data construction; no insecure handling or unsafe practices are apparent. Logging statements are informational. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper without malicious intent. It performs expected functions for managing app collaborators and teams securely. There are no signs of malware or security risks based on the provided code.",
