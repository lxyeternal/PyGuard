  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward API wrapper that constructs URLs from user inputs and makes HTTP requests.\n- Inputs such as email addresses are URL-encoded, reducing injection risk.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- Logging is used for audit purposes, but no sensitive data appears to be leaked beyond standard identifiers.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue-by-issue review:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** API wrapper for managing users, teams, collaborators.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; input handling appears secure.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low, acceptable)\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar API wrapper for app management.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; standard practices.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2 (acceptable)\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent; the confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; logging emails is standard but may raise privacy considerations, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate; confidence justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar API wrapper.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard URL encoding and request handling.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0.2\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scores; high confidence.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same API wrapper.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard practices.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are justified given the nature of the code—an API wrapper that handles user data and makes network requests—but no significant security risks are evident.\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to data handling and network requests, but not risky)\n\n**The code appears secure, benign, and well-implemented for its purpose.**",
