{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a client wrapper for interacting with App Center's crash and error reporting APIs, facilitating error group management, error details retrieval, symbol uploads, and related operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from response.json() in multiple methods; it reads files from the filesystem during symbol uploads; it constructs URLs from parameters and constants; it accesses environment variables indirectly via imported modules.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET and POST requests with response data; filesystem file reading during symbol upload; URL construction with input parameters; blob upload operations using connection strings derived from URL components.",
  "flows": "Sources such as response.json() or filesystem files provide data to the application; this data is used in API requests or blob uploads; URL and parameter construction direct data to HTTP request methods; data flows from inputs to outputs like API responses or blob storage uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of URL parsing to construct connection strings from URL components; no hardcoded secrets or credentials found; no obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or dynamic code execution; no hidden backdoors or unusual network activity; the code appears straightforward and functional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API wrapper for App Center crash reporting, utilizing secure and standard libraries for HTTP requests, JSON deserialization, and Azure Blob storage. All data inputs are either parameters, files, or response data, with no evident hardcoded credentials or malicious manipulations. URL and request construction follow standard patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code handles file uploads and API interactions securely, with proper error handling for missing files and upload failures. There are no indicators of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The only potentially sensitive operations involve URL and connection string parsing for blob storage, but these are derived from API responses, not hardcoded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, straightforward API wrapper for App Center crash and error management. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It properly handles inputs, responses, and external storage operations without suspicious or harmful code. Therefore, it poses no significant security risks.",
