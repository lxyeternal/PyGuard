  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for App Center crash and symbol management. It shows no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The overall risk score should remain very low (~0.1), consistent with a standard API wrapper."
