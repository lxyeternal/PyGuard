{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper client for interacting with App Center's crashes API, including error details, error groups, and symbol upload functionalities.",
  "sources": "Data is read from HTTP responses (`response.json()`), input parameters (e.g., org_name, app_name, error IDs, symbol files), and environment variables indirectly via imported modules (e.g., environment variables may be used elsewhere).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include HTTP requests (`http_get`, `http_post`, `http_patch`), file uploads (`upload_blob`), and constructing URLs with sensitive data like `SharedAccessSignature`. These could be exploited if untrusted data influences the request URLs, headers, or payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to URL constructions and HTTP request payloads; responses are deserialized into data structures. For example, `response.json()` flows into deserialization, and symbol files are read and uploaded to Blob storage. Inputs like `symbols_path`, `org_name`, `app_name`, and IDs flow into URLs, requests, and file handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior or hardcoded secrets are evident. The code properly manages file handling, URL construction, and API interactions. The method `_next_link_polished()` adjusts server responses but does not perform malicious transformations. There are no backdoors, hidden code, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper that manages error group details, error logs, and symbol uploads for App Center. It correctly handles URL generation, API request formation, and file uploads with progress callbacks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The use of environment variables or secrets is indirect and controlled. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions are present. The URL manipulations and deserialization are consistent with API client patterns. Overall, the code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate API client for App Center crash management and symbol uploads. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code. The overall security risk is low.",
