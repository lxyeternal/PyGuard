{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around the App Center crashes and error reporting APIs, facilitating error group management, error details retrieval, symbol uploads, and related operations.",
  "sources": "API responses from HTTP GET and POST requests, filesystem during symbol file uploads, URL components for storage connection strings.",
  "sinks": "Deserialized API responses, constructed URLs for API endpoints and storage, file uploads to Azure Blob Storage.",
  "flows": "API responses are deserialized into data models; symbol files are read from disk and uploaded via Azure Blob Storage SDK; URLs are constructed from API responses and used for storage operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, URL manipulations are controlled and based on API responses, no suspicious data flows or code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client wrapper that performs network requests, deserializes responses, manages symbol uploads, and constructs URLs for API endpoints and storage. It does not process untrusted user input in a malicious manner, nor does it contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. URL handling and storage interactions are based on API responses, not user-controlled data. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors are present. The functions follow expected patterns for such API wrappers, with proper error handling and validation. Overall, the code demonstrates secure and routine practices for interacting with external services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for App Center crash and symbol management. It shows no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero. The overall risk score should remain very low (~0.1), consistent with a standard API wrapper.",
