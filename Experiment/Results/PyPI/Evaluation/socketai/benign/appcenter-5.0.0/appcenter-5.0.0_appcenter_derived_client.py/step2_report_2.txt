  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes a client for App Center API, with standard HTTP methods, no suspicious data sources or sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses typical error handling and retries.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK base class, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious behavior. The low security risk score is appropriate, given the SDK nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard HTTP operations, error handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above, with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the same core functions, with standard data flows and no suspicious anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behaviors detected; standard API client.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar content, emphasizing safe data flows, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Highlights standard request handling, error management, and legitimate file uploads.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage; code appears well-structured.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis—no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.2), which is reasonable for SDK code that interacts with external services and handles sensitive tokens. The risk stems from external dependencies and network interactions, not malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9-0.95), justified by thorough reasoning and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nBased on the detailed reports and the code review:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, typical for SDKs interacting with external services)\n\n**Note:** No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK client with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
