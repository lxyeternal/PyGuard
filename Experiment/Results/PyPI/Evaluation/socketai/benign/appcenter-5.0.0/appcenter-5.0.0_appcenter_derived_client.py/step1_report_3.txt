{
  "purpose": "The code provides a base client class for interacting with the App Center API, including methods for HTTP GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, and file uploads, with retries and error handling.",
  "sources": "Data is read from network responses via requests.Response objects, environment variables for tokens, and input parameters such as URLs and data payloads.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow into network requests (e.g., URL, data, files) and into error messages or logs; potential risks involve mishandling of responses, but no direct data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources (responses, parameters) feed into HTTP request methods; responses are processed for status and content; errors may be raised as exceptions, but no further data exfiltration flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code segments are evident. The use of retries and exception handling appears standard. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns, malicious API calls, or secret exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a client for the App Center API with standard network operations, including error handling and retries. It uses standard libraries and patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behaviors are present. All data flows are typical for API interaction. Error handling is thorough, with structured exception creation. No malicious or sabotage patterns are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles network communication safely and correctly without embedding malicious behaviors.",
