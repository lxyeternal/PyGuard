{
  "purpose": "Provides a base class for interacting with the App Center API, including methods for HTTP requests, error handling, and URL generation.",
  "sources": "Requests made via requests.Session methods (get, post, patch, delete, put), and file uploads via azure_blob_upload.",
  "sinks": "Responses processed in create_exception, and responses used in URL generation, HTTP method calls, and file uploads.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL, data, files, etc.) flows into HTTP request methods; responses are checked for errors and may trigger exceptions; error responses may contain decoded error information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are evident. The code uses standard HTTP request handling, retries, and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a client for an API, with structured error handling and retries. The functions perform network requests with appropriate exception handling. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The code does not perform any unsafe evaluations, data leaks, or unauthorized system access. The only potential concern could be the direct use of 'requests.put' in 'azure_blob_upload' without additional validation, but this is typical for uploading files to cloud storage and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate and security-conscious with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard API client implementation with appropriate error handling and retry logic. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. It appears safe and legitimate.",
