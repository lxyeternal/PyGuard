  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence or absence of malicious indicators, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard SDK base class for interacting with the App Center API.\n- Uses well-known libraries (`requests`, `tenacity`, `deserialize`) with typical patterns.\n- Implements retries, error handling, URL generation, and file uploads.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious variable names, or hidden behaviors.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, command injection, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- File uploads are to Azure Blob Storage, which is standard for such SDKs.\n- Error handling decodes JSON error responses, which is typical.\n- No suspicious URLs or IP addresses are visible.\n- The code relies on external configuration (tokens, URLs), which is normal.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a legitimate SDK base class.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, seems reasonable given standard SDK functions.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, accurate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also correctly identifies the code as a standard API client.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious indicators. The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, with emphasis on standard request handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Focuses on response processing and network interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Highlights token usage and file upload, notes no suspicious URL or secret.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, consistent with clear code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero at 0.2, reflecting typical SDK risks, which are minimal here.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9–0.95), justified given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK client.\n- No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- File uploads, error handling, retries, URL generation are all typical.\n- No hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity.\n\n**Based on the provided reports and detailed review, I concur with the assessments.**\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (standard SDK, minimal risk, no malicious intent)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
