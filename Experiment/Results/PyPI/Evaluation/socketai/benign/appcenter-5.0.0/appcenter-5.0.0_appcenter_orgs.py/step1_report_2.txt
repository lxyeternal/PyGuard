{
  "purpose": "This code provides API wrapper classes for interacting with Microsoft App Center organization APIs, including managing users and apps within an organization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as 'org_name' and 'user_name'. Reads configuration or tokens passed during class instantiation. Uses response.json() as data source after HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from response.json() potentially to deserialize into objects, but does not write data to files, send data over the network, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('org_name', 'user_name') are used to generate request URLs; responses are deserialized into objects. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks such as system commands or network transmissions outside controlled API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No unusual or malicious behavior observed. Code appears to be straightforward API wrapper functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that wraps API calls to a third-party service (Microsoft App Center). It constructs URLs based on input parameters, performs GET and DELETE requests, and deserializes responses. No untrusted data is processed in a harmful way. No malicious or suspicious logic, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is present. Usage of external libraries (deserialize, logging) is standard. The code structure and comments are clear and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API wrapper for App Center org management functions. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activities or anomalies.",
