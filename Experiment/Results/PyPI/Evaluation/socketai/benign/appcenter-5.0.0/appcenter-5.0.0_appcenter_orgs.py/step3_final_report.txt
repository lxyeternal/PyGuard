  "purpose": "API wrapper for managing Microsoft App Center organization users and apps.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'org_name' and 'user_name' used to generate URLs; response.json() for deserialization.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET and DELETE requests to external API endpoints; deserialization of responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> HTTP request -> response.json() -> deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; straightforward URL and request handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client wrapping Microsoft App Center org APIs, constructing URLs from input parameters, performing HTTP GET/DELETE requests, and deserializing responses into data models. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. Response handling assumes valid JSON but is typical for such wrappers. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The code's logic is clear, well-structured, and relies on external libraries in a standard manner. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API wrapper with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
