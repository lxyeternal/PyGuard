{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around Microsoft App Center organization APIs, enabling operations such as retrieving users and apps in an organization, and deleting users.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'token' parameter for authentication, and method parameters like 'org_name' and 'user_name'. Data is also read from API responses via 'response.json()'.",
  "sinks": "API calls made with 'http_get' and 'http_delete' methods, and response data deserialization. No direct output or untrusted data modification occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('token', 'org_name', 'user_name') are used to generate URLs, which are then used to perform HTTP requests. API responses are deserialized into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard API wrapper functions with proper method segregation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API wrapper implementation with methods for retrieving organization users, deleting users, and fetching apps. It uses URL generation functions and standard HTTP request methods. No evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors, is present. The only data flow involves legitimate API interactions and deserialization. No obfuscation, suspicious variable usage, or malicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely handles data retrieval and modification through API calls with no signs of security risks or malware.",
