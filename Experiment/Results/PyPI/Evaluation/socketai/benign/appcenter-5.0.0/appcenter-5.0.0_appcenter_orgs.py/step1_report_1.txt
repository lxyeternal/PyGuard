  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around the App Center organization APIs for managing users and apps within an organization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'org_name' and 'user_name' for API calls. It also reads data from HTTP responses using response.json().",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into HTTP GET and DELETE requests via URLs constructed from input parameters. Response JSON data is deserialized into objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('org_name', 'user_name') are used to construct request URLs, which are then used in HTTP methods. Response JSON is deserialized into application data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of response.json() assumes valid JSON responses; no explicit data validation or sanitization evident, but this is typical for such API wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward API wrapper pattern, constructing URLs based on input parameters and performing HTTP GET/DELETE requests. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The code does not appear to handle sensitive data insecurely nor does it contain hardcoded secrets. Usage of deserialization is standard and not inherently risky without further context. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. All functions serve legitimate API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign API wrapper for managing organizational users and apps within the App Center platform. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malicious obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
