{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper for interacting with Microsoft App Center organization APIs, enabling operations such as listing users, deleting users, and retrieving apps within an organization.",
  "sources": "Inputs are org_name and user_name parameters from method calls; the token parameter during initialization; and JSON responses from HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP methods (http_get and http_delete) where data is sent to or received from external services; deserialization of JSON responses into Python objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (org_name, user_name) are used to construct request URLs; HTTP requests send these URLs to external services; responses are deserialized into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious URL patterns are present. The code appears to follow standard API wrapper patterns. No unusual code structures or obfuscation detected. The use of 'deserialize' and URL construction looks standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements API wrapper classes with typical methods for managing org users and apps, using straightforward URL construction and HTTP methods. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. External interactions via HTTP are typical for API clients. The deserialization process seems standard. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for Microsoft App Center, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected functions securely, without hardcoded secrets or suspicious external interactions.",
