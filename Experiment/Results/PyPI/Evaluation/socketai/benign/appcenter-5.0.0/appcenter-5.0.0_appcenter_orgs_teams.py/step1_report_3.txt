{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client wrapper for interacting with App Center organization and team APIs, mainly for retrieving team and user information within organizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from API responses via 'response.json()' in the 'http_get' method calls.",
  "sinks": "The data from 'response.json()' is passed to 'deserialize.deserialize', which processes the JSON data into Python objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API response through 'response.json()' into 'deserialize.deserialize', ultimately returning structured data. No untrusted input is directly processed outside API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard API wrapper logic. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for interacting with a REST API, fetching organization and team data. It uses standard methods for URL generation, makes HTTP GET requests, and deserializes the JSON responses into Python objects. The import statements and class methods are straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious operations. It adheres to expected API interaction patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client wrapper without malicious intent or security risks. It only interacts with known APIs and processes responses securely. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is found.",
