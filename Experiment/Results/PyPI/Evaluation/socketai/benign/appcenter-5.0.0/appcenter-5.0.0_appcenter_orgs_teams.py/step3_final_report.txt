  "purpose": "API wrapper class for interacting with App Center organization and team endpoints, constructing URLs from input parameters and performing HTTP GET requests, then deserializing responses into data models.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'org_name' and 'team_name' used in URL generation; response.json() data from HTTP GET responses.",
  "sinks": "Response data deserialized into models; no data leaks or untrusted data effects identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL generation -> HTTP GET request -> response.json() -> deserialization into models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. Input validation is not present but typical for API wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper that constructs URLs from provided parameters, performs GET requests, and deserializes responses. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. External modules are assumed legitimate. The code does not handle sensitive data directly or perform insecure operations. The only minor concern is reliance on external input for URL construction without validation, but this is standard for such wrappers and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward API wrapper with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
