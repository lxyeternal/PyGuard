  "purpose": "Wrapper class for interacting with Microsoft App Center organization and team APIs, providing methods to retrieve teams and users within organizations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'token', 'org_name', 'team_name'.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests made via self.http_get().",
  "flows": "Input parameters (org_name, team_name) are used to construct URLs for API calls, which are then executed via self.http_get().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard API call patterns and deserialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class that makes HTTP GET requests to retrieve team and user data from the App Center API. The URLs are generated based on input parameters, which are passed securely via method arguments. The code uses 'deserialize' for JSON processing. No data leaks, malicious payloads, or backdoors are apparent. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are observed, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments are present. The only external interaction is with a legitimate API endpoint, and all data flows seem straightforward and intended.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Overall, it is a safe, conventional implementation.",
