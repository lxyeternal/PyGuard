  "purpose": "Wrapper class for interacting with App Center organization and team APIs, providing methods to retrieve team and user information.",
  "sources": "Reads from input parameters (org_name, team_name), generates URLs, and performs HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to URLs constructed from parameters, deserialization of responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (org_name, team_name) flow into URL generation, then into HTTP requests, and response data flows into deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs. No suspicious URL patterns or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper that constructs URLs based on provided parameters, performs HTTP GET requests, and deserializes the JSON responses into Python objects. No suspicious or malicious code behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads is evident. Usage of external libraries appears standard. The design is typical for API client code, with no obfuscation or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles parameters for URL generation and response processing without any suspicious behavior.",
