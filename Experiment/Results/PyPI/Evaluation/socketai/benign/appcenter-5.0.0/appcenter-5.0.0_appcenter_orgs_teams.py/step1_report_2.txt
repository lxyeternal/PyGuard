{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper for interacting with App Center's organization and team APIs, allowing retrieval of team and user information within an organization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters org_name and team_name in methods get() and users(). These are user-provided strings used to generate URLs.",
  "sinks": "The generated URLs are used in http_get() requests, which may send requests to external servers. Response JSON data is deserialized into response models.",
  "flows": "User inputs (org_name, team_name) flow into URL generation, then into HTTP GET requests. Responses are deserialized into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. The code uses standard practices for API interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, wrapping API calls with URL construction and deserialization. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potential concern is reliance on external URL generation and response handling, but no malicious patterns are present. The import of 'deserialize' is standard for data processing. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper for App Center, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical operations for API interaction without any suspicious features.",
