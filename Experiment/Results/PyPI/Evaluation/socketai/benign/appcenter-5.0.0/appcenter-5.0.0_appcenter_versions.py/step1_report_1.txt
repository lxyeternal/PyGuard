{
  "purpose": "Wrapper class for interacting with App Center's version management API, including uploading binaries, managing releases, and fetching release details.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses, environment variables (not explicitly shown), and local file system (binary_path).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests (http_get, http_post, http_patch, http_post_raw_data), file operations (os.path.getsize, open).",
  "flows": "API responses or local file data → functions processing data, data sent via HTTP requests or file I/O operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; multiple retry mechanisms on network requests; no suspicious obfuscated code. Use of sleep for retries is standard. No unusual or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API wrapper for App Center's release management. It uses secure HTTP methods with retries and exception handling. No hardcoded secrets or malicious backdoors are present. It interacts with the local file system safely, only for reading files to upload. No suspicious network domain connections or data leaks are evident. The retry logic and exception handling suggest robustness but do not imply malicious intent. All data flows appear legitimate for an SDK of this purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK wrapper for managing app releases on App Center. No malicious or sabotage behavior identified. The use of retries, logging, and standard HTTP methods indicates normal operational design rather than malicious intent.",
