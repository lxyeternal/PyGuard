  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a legitimate SDK wrapper for App Center, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code performs standard API interactions, retries, and file uploads.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are evident.\n- The retry logic and logging are typical for such SDKs.\n- No suspicious data flows or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict**: The report's conclusion and malware score are justified. The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, considering the network interactions involve tokens, but these are passed as parameters, not hardcoded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the standard API client behavior, no malicious activity, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code handles network requests, retries, and file uploads securely.\n- No evidence of secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The mention of tokens being passed as parameters aligns with typical SDK behavior.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, given network operations involve sensitive tokens.\n\n**Verdict**: The assessment is consistent. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a legitimate API wrapper, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- Similar to previous reports, with standard API calls, retries, and file handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or secrets hardcoded.\n- The risk score is reasonable, given network interactions involve tokens.\n\n**Verdict**: The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard API client with no malicious behavior, handling release workflows securely.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- Uses tokens passed explicitly, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Retry logic and network requests are typical.\n\n**Verdict**: The evaluation is consistent; the malware score and risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a legitimate SDK client, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:\n- Standard API interactions, file handling, and retries.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- The risk score is low, considering the network and file operations.\n\n**Verdict**: The assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores** across all reports: **0** — consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated** scores: **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk** scores: Range from 0.1 to 0.2 — reasonable given the network interactions involving tokens, but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score**: **0.1** — minimal, typical for SDKs handling tokens and network requests.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK wrapper with no malicious or sabotage elements.",
