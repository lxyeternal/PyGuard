{
  "purpose": "This code is a wrapper SDK for Microsoft App Center's version management API, facilitating release uploads, metadata setting, release management, and status polling.",
  "sources": "API responses from network requests, local binary files, environment variables for tokens, and input parameters for functions.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests (GET, POST, PATCH) transmitting tokens and data, file system operations reading binaries, deserialization of responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses or local files to deserialization and further processing; tokens are passed as parameters; network requests send tokens and data; files are read for upload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. Retry mechanisms and token handling are standard. No suspicious data flows or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SDK wrapper for App Center, performing standard API interactions, retries, and file uploads. It handles tokens securely via parameters, employs retries with delays, and deserializes responses appropriately. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or sabotage are present. The network interactions involve tokens passed as parameters, which is typical for SDKs. The code's logic and data flows are consistent with legitimate SDK behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SDK wrapper for Microsoft App Center's release management. It shows no signs of malware, sabotage, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the code aligns with standard practices for such tools.",
