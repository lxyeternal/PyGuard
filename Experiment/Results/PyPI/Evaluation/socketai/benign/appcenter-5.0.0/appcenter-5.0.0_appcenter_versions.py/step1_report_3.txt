{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper around the App Center versions API for managing app releases, uploads, and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from environment variables, input file paths, and network responses; accessing binary files via os.path.getsize and open; URL generation and HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests (http_get, http_post, http_post_raw_data, http_patch) potentially sending data over the network; writing to files; logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (file paths, environment variables, network responses) are processed and passed through various methods; sensitive data (e.g., tokens) are embedded in URL parameters; network responses are deserialized and used to control program flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are observed. No suspicious or unusual code constructs. All network interactions seem to follow standard API usage patterns. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present. The code contains retries with delays, which are typical for network robustness but could be exploited if misused, though no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical API interactions for app version management: retrieving releases, uploading binaries, setting metadata, and releasing apps. It handles errors with retries, logs activity, and uses deserialization for responses. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors are detected. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials; tokens are passed as parameters. File handling is straightforward with no evidence of data leakage or tampering. The structure adheres to normal API client patterns without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for App Center, performing expected operations securely. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. It follows standard programming practices for such clients.",
