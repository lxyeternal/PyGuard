{
  "purpose": "The code provides a wrapper interface for interacting with App Center tokens API, allowing management of user tokens through get, create, and delete operations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration and data from method parameters, response JSON from API calls.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET/POST/DELETE requests to API endpoints, especially including sensitive token data in headers and responses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as token, name, scope flow into API request URLs and payloads; responses from API are deserialized into objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious or malicious API usage detected. No dynamic code execution or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper for managing tokens. It performs authenticated HTTP requests to specific endpoints, handles JSON serialization/deserialization, and logs activities. All parameters are passed explicitly, and the code relies on external libraries and API endpoints for operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only sensitive data involved is the token for authentication, which is expected in such API clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API wrapper without any signs of malicious intent or security issues. It securely manages tokens through standard API calls and proper logging. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
