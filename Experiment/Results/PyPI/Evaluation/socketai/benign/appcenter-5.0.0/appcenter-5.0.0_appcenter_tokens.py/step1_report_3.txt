{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper around App Center's token management API, allowing for retrieval, creation, and deletion of user tokens.",
  "sources": "Data is read from API responses (`response.json()`), input parameters (`name`, `scope`, `token`, `UserToken` objects), and internal method calls (`http_get`, `http_post`, `http_delete`).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially reach the API endpoints via `http_post` and `http_delete` methods, which are used to create and delete tokens respectively. These are normal API interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (`name`, `scope`, `token`, `UserToken`) are used to construct requests; responses are deserialized into `UserToken` objects. No untrusted data flows directly into code execution or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behavior. Usage of logging is standard for debugging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The class manages API interactions securely, with proper parameter usage and standard HTTP methods. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The code does not process untrusted input in insecure ways, nor does it invoke unsafe operations. It strictly wraps API calls to manage tokens.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper for managing App Center tokens. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
