{
  "purpose": "Wrapper around App Center tokens API to manage user tokens including creation, retrieval, and deletion.",
  "sources": "Reads include response.json() from HTTP GET and POST requests, method parameters such as token, name, scope, and token/UserToken objects for deletion.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests via self.http_get, self.http_post, self.http_delete; response.json() processing; logging output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (token, name, scope, token/UserToken) are used to build API request URLs and payloads; responses are deserialized into UserToken objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or encrypted data; no unusual code structures or dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an API wrapper for token management, using standard methods to perform HTTP requests and handle responses. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets or malicious operations. The logging statements record actions but do not reveal sensitive information. The use of response.json() and deserialization appears straightforward. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident; all operations are typical for API clients. The code's structure and logic suggest it is safe and intended for legitimate token management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API wrapper for managing user tokens on App Center. It performs typical operations with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No security risks or anomalies are detected.",
