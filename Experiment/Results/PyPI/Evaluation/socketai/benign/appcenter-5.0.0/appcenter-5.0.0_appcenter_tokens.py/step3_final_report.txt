  "purpose": "A wrapper class for managing App Center user tokens via API calls, including retrieval, creation, and deletion of tokens.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as token strings, token names, and scope enums; URL construction for API endpoints; response JSON data from HTTP GET/POST/DELETE requests.",
  "sinks": "Deserialized response data into UserToken objects; URL endpoints for token management; logging statements that do not expose sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (token, name, scope) are used to construct API request URLs and payloads; responses are deserialized into data objects; logs record actions without sensitive data exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious URL patterns; code follows standard API client structure; no malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API wrapper for managing tokens, utilizing standard HTTP methods and deserialization. It handles sensitive data appropriately, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. Logging is used for debugging without exposing secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2, confidence=0.9-0.95) are justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client for token management with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores and assessments across reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
