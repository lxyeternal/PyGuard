{
  "purpose": "Wrapper class for interacting with App Center tokens API, enabling token management functions such as get, create, and delete tokens.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters like 'name', 'scope', and 'token' for API calls; also reads 'token' for authentication.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET, POST, DELETE requests to the API endpoint URLs; response JSON deserialization.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, scope, token) are used to construct API request URLs and payloads, then responses are deserialized into objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; use of descriptive logging; standard API wrapper logic. No suspicious URL patterns or data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper for managing tokens on App Center. It constructs URLs based on a base URL, performs authenticated HTTP requests, and processes responses into data objects. No evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage functions, is present. The code uses logging, but only for debugging purposes related to token management, not sensitive data. The class operates within expected boundaries for a client wrapper. No hardcoded secrets are detected, and input handling appears straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It performs authorized token management functions securely and transparently. No security risks or malware signals identified.",
