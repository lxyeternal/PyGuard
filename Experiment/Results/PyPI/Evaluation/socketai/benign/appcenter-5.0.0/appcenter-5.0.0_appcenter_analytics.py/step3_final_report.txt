  "purpose": "A wrapper around the App Center analytics APIs to retrieve release counts for a specific app.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (org_name, app_name, releases), external modules (deserialize, self.generate_app_url, self.http_post)",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to external API endpoint, response deserialization",
  "flows": "Construct URL from parameters -> prepare data payload from releases -> send POST request -> deserialize response into ReleaseCounts",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward API interaction",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an API URL based on input parameters, prepares a data payload from the releases list, performs an HTTP POST request, and deserializes the JSON response into a ReleaseCounts object. It relies on external modules for network communication and data handling, which are assumed to be secure. No malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code follows standard API client patterns, with no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
