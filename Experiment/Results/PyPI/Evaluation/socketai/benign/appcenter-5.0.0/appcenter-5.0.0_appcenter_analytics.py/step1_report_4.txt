  "purpose": "Wrapper around the App Center analytics APIs to retrieve release counts for an app.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: token, org_name, app_name, releases list. Data constructed from releases list. Uses self.generate_app_url and self.http_post for network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network request via self.http_post with constructed URL and release data. Response parsed with deserialize.deserialize.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate a URL and request data. Data from releases flows into the request payload. Response data flows into deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. Use of dynamic URL construction and HTTP POST is standard for API clients.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API wrapper that constructs URLs, formats request data, performs an HTTP POST request, and deserializes the response. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden code. No external inputs are directly injected into sensitive parts without sanitization. The functions are straightforward, and the code relies on external libraries and functions for network communication and deserialization. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or data handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an API client for retrieving release counts from App Center analytics. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks based on the provided code. It appears to be a standard, well-structured wrapper class.",
