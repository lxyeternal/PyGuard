  "purpose": "Wrapper class for interacting with App Center analytics APIs to retrieve release counts for a specified app.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters: 'org_name', 'app_name', and 'releases' list; data in the 'releases' list objects.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to an external API endpoint, JSON deserialization of response data.",
  "flows": "Parameters 'org_name', 'app_name', and 'releases' are used to construct request URL and payload, which are then sent via http_post; response JSON is deserialized into ReleaseCounts object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code correctly constructs API URL and posts data securely. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class that wraps API calls to the App Center analytics service. It constructs URLs and payloads based on input parameters and makes an HTTP POST request. The use of parameters for URL construction and data sending appears standard and safe. No user input sanitization issues are evident; the code relies on external functions and classes for security and data handling. The deserialization step appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior. The overall flow seems typical for an API wrapper module, with proper logging and data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles data securely and does not contain any signs of malware or malicious sabotage.",
