{
  "purpose": "Wrapper around App Center analytics APIs to retrieve release counts for an app.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters: 'org_name', 'app_name', and 'releases'. The 'response.json()' from HTTP POST request is a data source.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP POST request sends data over the network; 'response.json()' could potentially leak data if misused, but in this context it appears to be an output from the API response.",
  "flows": "User input ('org_name', 'app_name', 'releases') is used to generate the request URL and payload; the request is sent via 'http_post'; the response data is deserialized into 'ReleaseCounts'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls or unusual code patterns. Logging appears standard. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper that constructs a URL, prepares data payload from input parameters, makes an HTTP POST request, and deserializes the response. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified. It adheres to expected patterns for API wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It handles data securely and does not contain any suspicious activity.",
