{
  "purpose": "Wrapper for App Center analytics API, providing methods to retrieve release counts for an app.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'releases' parameter, org_name, and app_name; these are used to construct request data.",
  "sinks": "The 'http_post' method sends data to an external API endpoint; response.json() processes server response.",
  "flows": "Releases data is assembled into a request payload, sent via HTTP POST, and the response is deserialized into a ReleaseCounts object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated features. Use of 'deserialize' module is standard; no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a request URL, prepares release data, and posts it to an API endpoint. The response is processed and returned. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No unsafe code practices detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard API wrapper with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely formats data for API request, handles response safely, and uses standard logging and inheritance.",
