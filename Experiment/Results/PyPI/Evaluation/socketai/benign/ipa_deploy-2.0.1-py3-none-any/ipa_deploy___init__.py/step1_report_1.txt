{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to process an IPA file, verify dependencies, and execute commands to unzip and deploy an iOS application.",
  "sources": "Input source: sys.argv parameters (the IPA filename); environment PATH (via 'which' command); external commands like 'unzip', 'ios-deploy'.",
  "sinks": "Commands executed via exec_cmd: 'rm', 'mkdir', 'unzip', 'ios-deploy'. These are used to manipulate files and deploy apps, but no untrusted data flows into dangerous commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input filename from sys.argv -> check existence -> unzip IPA -> deploy app via 'ios-deploy'. No untrusted data flows into insecure commands; commands are predefined and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The script performs routine operations, such as file extraction and deployment, with standard commands.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the presence of required tools, checks the IPA file's existence, then executes a sequence of commands: cleaning temporary directories, extracting the IPA, deploying the app using 'ios-deploy', and cleaning up. All command executions depend on validated inputs and predefined commands. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform legitimate tasks related to IPA deployment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The operations are standard for app deployment and file management, with proper validation steps.",
