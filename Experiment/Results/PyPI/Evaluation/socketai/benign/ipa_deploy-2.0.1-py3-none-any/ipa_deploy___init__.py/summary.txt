  "conclusion": "The code is a standard IPA deployment utility with no malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is command injection risk due to unsanitized user input used in shell commands with shell=True. Scores from reports are appropriate; I recommend assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score around 0.3 to reflect the potential for exploitation if inputs are malicious. To enhance security, refactor the code to avoid shell=True or sanitize inputs properly."
