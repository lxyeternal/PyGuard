  "purpose": "The script updates its own version number by incrementing the patch version when run with the 'bump' argument.",
  "sources": "Reads its own source code file (__file__) when executed with 'bump' argument.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated content back to its own source code file (__file__).",
  "flows": "Reads __file__ -> Processes version string -> Writes back to __file__ after modification.",
  "anomalies": "Self-modifying code that updates its own source file is unusual and can be considered risky or suspicious in supply chain context.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if run as main and if the argument 'bump' is provided. It then opens its own source file, reads all lines, and looks for the line defining __version__. It parses this line to extract the version number, increments the patch component, and reconstructs the line. It writes all lines back to the source file with the updated version. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The self-modification functionality is unusual but not malicious per se; it could be benign version bumping. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign version update mechanism by modifying its own source file, which is uncommon but not malicious. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
