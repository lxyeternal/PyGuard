  "purpose": "Self-modifying script that increments its own __version__ variable when run with 'bump' argument.",
  "sources": "Reads its own source file (__file__) to locate and modify the __version__ line.",
  "sinks": "Rewrites its own source file with updated version; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads source file -> locates __version__ line -> updates version number -> writes back to source file.",
  "anomalies": "Self-modification of source code; assumes specific format of __version__ line; no safeguards against corruption.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a controlled self-modification to increment its version number. It does not contain malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation. The behavior is unusual but benign. The source code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads. The main concern is the self-modification pattern, which could be risky if the source is tampered with or used maliciously in supply chain scenarios. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are appropriate given the code's behavior. No evidence suggests malicious activity, and the code's purpose appears to be benign version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign self-versioning utility with self-modification behavior. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. While the self-modification is unconventional, it is not malicious. The low security risk score is justified, though caution is advised in supply chain contexts due to the potential for misuse. Overall, the code is safe, and the current scores are appropriate.",
