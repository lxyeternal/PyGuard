  "purpose": "Script to bump the version number in its own source code file when run with 'bump' argument.",
  "sources": "Reads its own source file (__file__) when the 'bump' argument is provided.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to its own source file (__file__) to update the version line.",
  "flows": "When executed with 'bump' argument, reads its own file, updates the __version__ line, and rewrites the file.",
  "anomalies": "Self-modifying code that updates its own source file; no external input validation or security checks.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if run directly with a 'bump' argument. It then opens its own file (__file__), reads all lines, and searches for the line starting with '__version__'. It extracts the current version, increments the patch number, and rewrites the entire file with the updated version line. The process involves self-modification without input validation or safeguards. No other malicious or suspicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be a version bump utility embedded within its own source.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs self-modification to increment its version number, which is generally benign and not malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is self-modifying code, which is not inherently malicious but could be misused if manipulated maliciously. Overall, the code appears safe with respect to supply chain security concerns.",
