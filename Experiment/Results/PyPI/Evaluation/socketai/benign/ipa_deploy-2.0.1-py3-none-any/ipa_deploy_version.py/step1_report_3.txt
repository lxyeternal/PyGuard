{
  "purpose": "The script appears to manage versioning of its own source file, allowing the version number to be incremented via command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Reads its own source code file (__file__) when the 'bump' argument is provided.",
  "sinks": "Reads and writes to its own source file (__file__). No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "If 'bump' argument is given, source is the script's own file; sink is the same file after modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The script modifies its own source code to increment the version number, which is a self-modifying behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing necessary modules and defining version variables. When executed directly with the 'bump' argument, it reads its own source file, locates the line defining '__version__', increments the patch version number, and rewrites the source file with the updated version. This is a straightforward self-modification pattern. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The self-modifying pattern is unusual but not inherently malicious; it is often used for automation or version control within the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a self-updating version handler that increments its own version number in the source file. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It could be considered unusual due to self-modification, but this does not constitute malware or security risk.",
