  "purpose": "The script automates version bumping for a Python package by modifying its own source file when run with the 'bump' argument.",
  "sources": "Reads its own source code (__file__) to locate and modify the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to its own source file (__file__), potentially overwriting it.",
  "flows": "Reads the script's own source code -> modifies the __version__ line -> writes the updated content back to the same file.",
  "anomalies": "Self-modifying code is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if it is executed as the main module and if the command-line argument 'bump' is provided. If so, it opens its own file, reads all lines, searches for the line defining __version__, and increments the patch version number by 1. It then rewrites the entire file with the updated version number. The process involves reading and writing to its own source, which is unusual but typical for self-versioning scripts. There are no indicators of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and appears designed for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a self-modifying version bump operation without any malicious intent. It only alters its own __version__ variable when invoked with the 'bump' argument. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
