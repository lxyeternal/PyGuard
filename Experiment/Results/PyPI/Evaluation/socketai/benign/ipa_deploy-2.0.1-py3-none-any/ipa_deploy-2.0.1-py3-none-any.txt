      "conclusion": "The code is a standard IPA deployment utility with no malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is command injection risk due to unsanitized user input used in shell commands with shell=True. Scores from reports are appropriate; I recommend assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score around 0.3 to reflect the potential for exploitation if inputs are malicious. To enhance security, refactor the code to avoid shell=True or sanitize inputs properly."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign self-versioning utility with self-modification behavior. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. While the self-modification is unconventional, it is not malicious. The low security risk score is justified, though caution is advised in supply chain contexts due to the potential for misuse. Overall, the code is safe, and the current scores are appropriate."
