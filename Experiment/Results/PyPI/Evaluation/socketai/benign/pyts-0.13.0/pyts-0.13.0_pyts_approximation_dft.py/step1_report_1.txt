{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Discrete Fourier Transform feature extractor for time series data, allowing selection of Fourier coefficients based on various parameters, including ANOVA-based selection.",
  "sources": "Reads input data in fit(), transform(), and fit_transform() methods; reads class labels in fit() for ANOVA-based selection.",
  "sinks": "Outputs selected Fourier coefficients; no other data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through fit() or fit_transform() into Fourier transform and scaling, then to coefficient selection based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors. Use of standard libraries and typical pattern for Fourier analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Fourier transform-based feature extraction with options for coefficient selection. It uses numpy, sklearn, and math libraries. No signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It strictly handles data transformation for analytical purposes. Parameters and methods follow common practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Fourier feature extraction with parameter controls. There are no indications of malicious intent or supply chain compromise within this code segment.",
