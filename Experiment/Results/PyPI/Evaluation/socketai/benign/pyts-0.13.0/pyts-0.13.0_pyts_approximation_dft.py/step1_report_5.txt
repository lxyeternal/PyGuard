{
  "purpose": "Implementing a Discrete Fourier Transform feature extractor for time series data with optional statistical analysis for feature selection.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy, sklearn, math, warnings, and relative modules; no external inputs within the class.",
  "sinks": "Transform methods perform FFT computation and data scaling, but do not send or leak data externally; no network or system modification code.",
  "flows": "Input data is scaled, transformed via FFT, and coefficients are selected based on parameters or statistical tests; no data exfiltration paths observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No network calls, no hidden behaviors, and no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard feature extraction class with methods for fitting, transforming, and selecting Fourier coefficients, optionally using ANOVA. It includes parameter validation, data scaling, FFT computation, and feature selection logic. The implementation appears consistent with scientific computing practices, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. No external network or file system access, no hidden or obfuscated code, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code’s purpose is legitimate, and all dependencies are common in data science workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a Fourier Transform feature extractor with optional feature selection. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and suitable for use in data processing pipelines.",
