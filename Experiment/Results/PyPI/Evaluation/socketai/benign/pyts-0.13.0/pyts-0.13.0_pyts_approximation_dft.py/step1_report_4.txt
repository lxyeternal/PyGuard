  "purpose": "The code implements a Discrete Fourier Transform for feature extraction from time series data, with options for coefficient selection and normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data X for transformation, possibly uses y for ANOVA-based coefficient selection.",
  "sinks": "Returns transformed Fourier coefficients; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> normalization/scaling -> FFT -> coefficient selection -> output Fourier coefficients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Uses standard libraries and methods. No suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Fourier transform on input time series data, with options for coefficient selection based on ANOVA or order. It normalizes data if specified, reshapes FFT results, and selects coefficients accordingly. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malicious data handling. It primarily uses standard numpy, sklearn, and math functions. No suspicious input/output or external data transmission is present. The methods and structure are typical for a feature extraction class in machine learning pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a Fourier-based feature extractor. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It performs standard data processing tasks securely. No security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
