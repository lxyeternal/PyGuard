{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Fourier transform-based feature extraction method for time series data, allowing selection of Fourier coefficients with optional normalization and statistical testing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (X), class labels (y) when performing ANOVA-based coefficient selection, and uses internal functions for data validation and scaling.",
  "sinks": "Processes data in-memory; no external network, file, or system modification operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through normalization, Fourier transform, coefficient selection, and returns the selected features; no external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Fourier feature extraction with optional coefficient selection via ANOVA, normalization, and handling of different data shapes. It does not include any malicious or suspicious operations, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The implementation is clear, well-structured, and aligns with common signal processing practices. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed. The scoring in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) is consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Fourier-based feature extraction with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain inclusion.",
