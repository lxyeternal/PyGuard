  "purpose": "Implementing a Discrete Fourier Transform feature extractor with optional feature selection methods for time series data.",
  "sources": "Imports numpy, scikit-learn components, math, warnings, and relative package modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or network activity; mainly processes data locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through scaling, FFT transformation, optional feature selection, and output of selected coefficients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. Code appears standard for signal processing. No unusual code structures or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for Fourier transform feature extraction with optional feature selection. It reads data from input parameters, processes via numpy FFT functions, and optionally performs ANOVA-based feature selection. No signs of malicious data handling, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The methods are typical for a feature extraction pipeline, and the code structure is consistent with standard practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Fourier transform feature extraction class with feature selection. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures are detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
