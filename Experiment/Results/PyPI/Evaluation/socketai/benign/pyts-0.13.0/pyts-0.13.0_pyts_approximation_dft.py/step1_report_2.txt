{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Discrete Fourier Transform feature extractor for time series data, allowing selection and transformation of Fourier coefficients for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (X), class labels (y, optionally), and uses internal methods for scaling and FFT computation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs transformed Fourier coefficients; no data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Input data X is scaled and transformed via FFT, then coefficient indices are selected based on parameters and optionally using ANOVA; the selected coefficients are returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behavior observed. The code primarily performs standard signal processing and feature selection.",
  "analysis": "The class performs standard data validation, Fourier transformation, and feature selection using existing libraries (numpy, sklearn). No code injections, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The functions operate on data inputs, transform them, and output the results without side effects. The logic aligns with typical feature extraction workflows, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of Fourier transform-based feature extraction for time series analysis. There are no indicators of malware or malicious behavior. It solely performs data processing and feature selection with standard libraries, with no suspicious operations.",
