  "purpose": "Implementation of Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) for time series dimensionality reduction.",
  "sources": "Input time series data provided to transform() method; data validation via check_array.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file I/O; purely in-memory computation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input through validation, segmentation, and mean calculation in _paa, returning reduced time series.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-documented implementation of PAA, utilizing numpy for numerical operations and numba for JIT compilation. It performs segmentation and averaging without external side effects or malicious features. Validation ensures correct parameter types and values. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent implementation of PAA with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It is a safe utility for time series dimensionality reduction.",
