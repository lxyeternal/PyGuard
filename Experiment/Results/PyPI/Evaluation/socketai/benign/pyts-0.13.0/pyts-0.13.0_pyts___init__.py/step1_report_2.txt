  "purpose": "Provides metadata and module export definitions for a Python package focused on time series transformation and classification.",
  "sources": "Module docstring (descriptive comment), version string '__version__', and '__all__' export list.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data or input processing, no untrusted data handling, no output, no network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow paths or untrusted data sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment, version declaration, and an export list. There are no input reading, data processing, or output functions. It appears to be standard package metadata and module interface setup. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package metadata snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines the package's version and exports for the package modules.",
