  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely descriptive and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code consists of package metadata and documentation comments only.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a module docstring describing the package's purpose, followed by version and __all__ variable declarations. There are no executable statements, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for Python package metadata, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
