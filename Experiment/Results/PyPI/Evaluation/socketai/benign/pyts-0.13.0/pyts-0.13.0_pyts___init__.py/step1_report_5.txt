  "purpose": "This module provides tools and algorithms for time series transformation and classification in Python, aimed at making such tasks accessible and straightforward.",
  "sources": "No data input or reading operations are present in the provided snippet.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or output operations, especially those that could leak untrusted data, are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is observable within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mainly a descriptive module with versioning and public API declarations; no suspicious or unusual code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a descriptive docstring, version assignment, and an explicit list of exported module components. It does not contain executable code beyond variable assignments and string/list declarations. No input handling, data processing, or external communication functions are included. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file, serving as an entry point or namespace definition. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code is purely informational and structural, typical for a Python package initialization. Therefore, the malware score is low, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
