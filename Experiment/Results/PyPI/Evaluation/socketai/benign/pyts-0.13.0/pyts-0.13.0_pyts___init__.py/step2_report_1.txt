  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package metadata or initialization file, containing only module docstrings, version strings, and export lists.\n- No executable logic, data processing, input/output, network operations, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), which aligns with the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are typical for Python package __init__.py files or module descriptors.\n- No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs, are identified.\n- The malware scores are all zero, reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are also zero or near-zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware scores are appropriate at 0, given no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The risk scores are minimal, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- None detected. The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is purely metadata and package setup information.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign package metadata. No adjustments needed.",
