{
  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata and module export definitions for the pyts time series classification library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, version information, and the __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks are present; the code is purely descriptive.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring, version string, and an __all__ list defining exports. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as benign package metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent with its nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
