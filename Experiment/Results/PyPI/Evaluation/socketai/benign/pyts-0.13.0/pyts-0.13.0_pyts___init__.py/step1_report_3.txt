  "purpose": "Provide time series transformation and classification tools for Python, including preprocessing, algorithms, and utilities.",
  "sources": "No input data sources are explicitly read in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels are evident; no untrusted data handling or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is mainly package metadata and import definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The version string and __all__ list are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of package metadata, including versioning and an explicit list of exported modules. There are no data inputs, external communications, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module descriptor, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign package description with no embedded malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initialization fragment with no malicious or security concerns detected. It simply declares package metadata and exportable modules.",
