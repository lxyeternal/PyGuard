  "purpose": "Implementation of Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) for time series discretization and symbolic representation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data `X` in the `transform` method, which is a numerical array of shape (n_samples, n_timestamps). It also reads parameters such as `n_bins`, `strategy`, and `alphabet` during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data externally. It uses internal discretization functions and returns the transformed symbolic or numerical array.",
  "flows": "Input data `X` is checked and processed through `KBinsDiscretizer`, then mapped to alphabet or integers. No external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or code injection. Use of standard scikit-learn utilities and clear parameter checks. No hardcoded credentials or secret data. No network activity or system modification detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for SAX, with methods for fitting (no-op) and transforming data. It validates input parameters and the alphabet configuration. The `transform` method discretizes input data into bins using `KBinsDiscretizer`, then maps these bins to symbols or integers. The code structure and logic follow standard practices for this type of transformation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. All external libraries are well-known, and no unusual behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of the SAX technique for time series data discretization. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The use of standard libraries and clear parameter validation suggests it is safe and intended for legitimate purposes.",
