  "purpose": "Implementation of Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) for time series data transformation into symbolic or numeric bins.",
  "sources": "Input data array X, parameters n_bins, strategy, and alphabet.",
  "sinks": "Discretized indices or symbols representing the input data, used for symbolic analysis.",
  "flows": "Input data -> check_array -> KBinsDiscretizer -> fit_transform -> mapping to alphabet or indices.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Parameter validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SAX, relying on well-known libraries. It performs parameter validation, discretizes data into bins, and maps bins to symbols or integers. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The flexible alphabet parameter could be misused if misconfigured, but this is a normal feature, not malicious. The scoring from reports correctly indicates no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk primarily due to potential misconfiguration, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and implements a standard SAX transformation without malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor security risk score (~0.1) is justified by the optional alphabet parameter, which could be misused if misconfigured but does not constitute a security threat.",
