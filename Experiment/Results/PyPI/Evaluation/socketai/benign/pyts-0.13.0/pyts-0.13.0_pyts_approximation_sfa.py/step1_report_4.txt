  "purpose": "Implementation of Symbolic Fourier Approximation for time series data transformation and feature extraction.",
  "sources": "Imports from sklearn and local modules (.dft, .mcb, ..base); no external data sources; internal attribute assignments and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Transformation methods (_pipeline.transform and _pipeline.fit_transform); no data leaks or network connections; no untrusted input handling outside typical sklearn usage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X through fit/fit_transform pipelines involving DiscreteFourierTransform and MultipleCoefficientBinning, then to transform methods; no evidence of untrusted data leading to malicious effect.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of standard sklearn pipelines and transformation steps appears normal. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual variable manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a sklearn estimator for symbolic Fourier approximation, utilizing existing well-known classes and methods. It handles data transformation, feature extraction, and binning with configurable parameters. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code structure aligns with typical machine learning preprocessing pipelines. It leverages local modules (.dft, .mcb) which are not provided here, but assuming they are standard or benign. Overall, the implementation appears legitimate with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a time series transformation technique, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is consistent with expected functionality for such an estimator and does not pose security risks.",
