{
  "purpose": "The code implements a symbolic Fourier approximation transformer for time series data, used for feature extraction and transformation in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arrays X and optional labels y, especially during fit and fit_transform methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is directly transformed or exposed, but no network or file I/O is present; no malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data X flows into the fit and fit_transform methods, passing through the DiscreteFourierTransform and MultipleCoefficientBinning steps to produce transformed features.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard use of scikit-learn components. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a transformer class for symbolic Fourier approximation, using standard machine learning components such as scikit-learn's Pipeline. It utilizes imported modules for discrete Fourier transforms and binning, which are typical in feature extraction. No network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are present. The class methods follow conventional patterns for fit, transform, and fit_transform. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or security vulnerabilities. The code is well-structured, with clear parameter handling and attribute setting.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a feature extraction transformer for time series data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks based on the static analysis. The code appears legitimate and safe for use.",
