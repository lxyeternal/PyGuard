  "purpose": "Implement a Symbolic Fourier Approximation transformer for time series data, allowing feature extraction and discretization for classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data X during fit, fit_transform, and transform methods.",
  "sinks": "Transform method outputs transformed data; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit/fit_transform/transform methods to internal pipeline steps (DiscreteFourierTransform and MultipleCoefficientBinning), then outputs the transformed features.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Uses standard sklearn pipeline components and custom classes; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a scikit-learn estimator for symbolic Fourier approximation, involving data preprocessing, Fourier transform, and binning. The class methods perform fitting and transformation with internal pipelines. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious file operations are present. The code relies on well-defined classes and standard Python features without obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a time series feature extraction technique with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
