  "purpose": "Implementation of a scikit-learn transformer for Symbolic Fourier Approximation, performing Fourier coefficient selection and binning for time series data.",
  "sources": "Data input to fit and fit_transform methods; internal steps accessing 'X' and 'y'.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network communication, or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through DiscreteFourierTransform and MultipleCoefficientBinning steps within the pipeline during fit and transform.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard implementation of a scientific data transformation class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for symbolic Fourier approximation, utilizing standard sklearn components and external modules. It performs data transformation with configurable parameters, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The support_ and bin_edges_ attributes are set during fit, and the code relies solely on local computations. No external communication or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a time series feature extraction transformer. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected.",
