  "purpose": "Implement a Symbolic Fourier Approximation transformer for time series data, including feature selection and binning for symbolic representation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data X via fit, fit_transform, and transform methods; it also uses class parameters for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Transform methods may process untrusted data, but no direct data leakage or malicious output appears evident. No external network or file system access is present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through fit/fit_transform, processed via internal pipeline components (DiscreteFourierTransform and MultipleCoefficientBinning), resulting in transformed features.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code relies on standard sklearn pipelines and local mathematical transformations without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for symbolic Fourier approximation with configurable parameters. It uses external libraries (sklearn, custom modules) for Fourier transformation and binning. Data flows from input through fit and transform stages, with no external communication or hidden behaviors. Parameters such as data normalization and feature selection are configurable but do not suggest malicious intent. No unusual code constructs or hardcoded secrets are present. The class appears to be a standard implementation of a scientific data transformation technique, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a time series transformation algorithm for feature extraction, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily relies on local computations and standard libraries. The overall security risk is minimal.",
