  "purpose": "Implementing a multivariate binning transformation for time series data, enabling discretization using various strategies.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from provided array X, possibly reading labels y if 'entropy' strategy is used.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks detected; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data X is checked and possibly combined with labels y; bin edges are computed and stored; data is digitized using bin edges; final output is bin indices or alphabetic representations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. No use of dynamic code execution, suspicious variable names, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs statistical binning and discretization of data. It uses standard libraries like numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn without any suspicious operations. There are no signs of data leakage, credential handling, or network activity. The use of decision trees for entropy-based binning is a common approach. The functions utilize njit for performance but do not execute dynamic or malicious code. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a data binning transformer.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a multivariate binning transformer with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It employs common statistical and machine learning techniques for data discretization, and there are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
