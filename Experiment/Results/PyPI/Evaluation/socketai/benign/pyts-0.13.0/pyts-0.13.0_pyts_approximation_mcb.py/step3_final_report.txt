{
  "purpose": "Implements a multistrategy binning transformer for time series or tabular data, discretizing continuous features into categorical bins.",
  "sources": "Data input via the fit() method (X, y), reading feature values for bin edge computation; data input via transform() method for binning.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output, network communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from fit() to compute bin edges based on strategy; during transform(), data is digitized into bins using precomputed edges.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of standard libraries and techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical binning strategies (uniform, quantile, normal, entropy) using numpy, scipy, sklearn, and numba for performance. Validation functions ensure data integrity. No network activity, external communication, or obfuscated code is present. Decision trees for entropy-based binning are legitimate. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The implementation is clear, well-structured, and employs common practices in data preprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a multistrategy binning transformer with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
