{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures a Python package called 'pyts' for time series classification, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports 'pyts' module for version; defines package data files from specific directories.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data directly affects system security or leaks occur. No network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version from 'pyts' module -> uses that in package setup; reads README for description -> package metadata used during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Potential concern is the dynamic access to 'pyts.__version__' before confirming 'pyts' is properly imported and safe. The code reads files and specifies package data, but no hidden or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package setup using setuptools. It imports 'pyts' to retrieve version info, reads the README.md for description, and specifies dependencies and package data. No user input handling, network activity, or code execution based on external inputs is observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It uses standard practices and dependencies, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
