{
  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'pyts' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; imports 'pyts' to access its __version__ attribute; static package data paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or external command execution.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pyts' to retrieve version info; static data assignments; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns; import of 'pyts' before installation is typical but assumes package trustworthiness.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with no malicious or malicious-like behavior. It imports 'pyts' solely to access its version, which is common practice. No external data, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. All package data paths are static and from trusted sources. The absence of dynamic code execution or external dependencies reduces security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is legitimate, safe, and free of malware or obfuscation. It follows standard Python packaging conventions with no security risks detected.",
