{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyts', including metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; importing 'pyts' module to access version; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or potentially dangerous code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is setup configuration code without data processing or input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with package metadata, dependencies, and package data references.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'pyts' solely to access its version attribute, which is a common practice in setup scripts. It reads a README file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data. All actions are consistent with standard Python packaging procedures. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. There are no indications of data leakage, network activity, or backdoors. The dependencies are typical for scientific Python packages, and no suspicious files or code are referenced.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and contains no anomalies that suggest sabotage or malware.",
