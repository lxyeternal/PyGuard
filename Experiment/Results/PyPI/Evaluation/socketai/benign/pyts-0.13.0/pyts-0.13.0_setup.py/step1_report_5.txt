{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'pyts' for time series classification, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'pyts' module for version info; reads 'README.md' file for long description; defines package data paths; reads package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from 'pyts.__version__'; reads description from file; uses static package data paths; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No network or I/O operations beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, including importing dependencies, reading a README file, and defining package metadata, requirements, and data files. No malicious patterns such as network calls, credential handling, or code execution are present. The use of 'pyts.__version__' assumes 'pyts' is importable and contains a version attribute, which is typical for Python packages but could be a point of failure if 'pyts' is maliciously altered. However, this does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a conventional setup script without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. It is safe based on this analysis.",
