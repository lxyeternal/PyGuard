{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'pyts' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input sources or user data are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The setup function call passes static data to setuptools for package installation; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows are present; all data are statically defined or read from trusted files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behavior. Use of standard setup tools and static data.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It reads the README.md for the long description, sets various metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with all necessary parameters. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The dependencies are explicitly listed and appear typical for a scientific package. The package data references specific dataset files with no embedded executable or suspicious content. Overall, this is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It only manages package metadata, dependencies, and data files. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present.",
