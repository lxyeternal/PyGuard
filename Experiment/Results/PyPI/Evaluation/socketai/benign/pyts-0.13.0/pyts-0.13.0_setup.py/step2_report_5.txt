  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup configuration.\n- Sources: Reads README.md; imports 'pyts' for version.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or dangerous flows.\n- Anomalies: None; typical setup script.\n- Analysis: No suspicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe, no malware.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, configuring 'pyts'.\n- Sources: Reads README.md; imports 'pyts' for version.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: Slight concern about dynamic import of 'pyts' for version, but standard practice.\n- Analysis: Standard setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Sources: No untrusted input.\n- Sinks/Flows: Static data, no dynamic or external data.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup for 'pyts'.\n- Sources: Reads README.md; imports 'pyts' for version.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Conventional setup, no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources: Reads README.md; imports 'pyts' for version.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or external calls.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior, just reliance on 'pyts' module for version.\n- Analysis: Standard setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\nAll reports consistently identify this setup script as a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The only potential concern is the import of 'pyts' to access its version, which is a common practice but assumes 'pyts' is a trustworthy package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden code, or external data exfiltration.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a minimal, negligible risk, mainly due to dependency on the trustworthiness of 'pyts')  \n\n**Note:** Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, the scores remain at zero. The small risk score is just a conservative placeholder acknowledging reliance on external package integrity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script for 'pyts' appears entirely legitimate, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It follows standard Python packaging practices, and the analysis supports a safe conclusion.",
