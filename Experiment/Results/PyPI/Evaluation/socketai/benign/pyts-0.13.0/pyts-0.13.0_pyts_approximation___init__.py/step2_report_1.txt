  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import and export statements for internal modules/classes.\n- No reports mention dynamic code execution, external data handling, network communication, or other suspicious behaviors.\n- The code structure is consistent across reports, indicating a typical __init__.py pattern for exposing package API.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code provided is straightforward: importing specific classes from sibling modules and defining `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources that could be exploited are present.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic evaluation, or external interactions are observed.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The consistent conclusion across all reports supports the benign nature.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all evidence points to benign import/export code with no malicious activity, higher scores are unjustified.\n- The malware score should remain 0.\n- The security risk score should also be 0.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities where none exist.\n- No claims about potential exploits are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- Scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard module __init__.py file that imports classes from internal modules and exposes them via `__all__`. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and justified in their assessments.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The code is safe and benign.",
