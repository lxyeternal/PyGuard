{
  "purpose": "This module imports various time series approximation algorithms and makes them available for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module imports and the module's __all__ attribute definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process external input or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports specific classes and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and consists solely of imports and an __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code imports five approximation algorithm classes from local modules, then explicitly defines an __all__ list to specify public API components. There are no functions, data processing, or external input handling. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file designed to re-export classes. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as dynamic execution or external data access, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer that imports and exposes specific classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern in Python packages to manage namespace exports.",
