  "purpose": "This module imports specific approximation classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from sibling modules (.paa, .sax, .dft, .mcb, .sfa).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export structure with no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module (__init__.py style) that imports classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for API exposure. It contains no dynamic evaluation, network communication, or data processing. The code structure is simple and static, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exposing classes in a Python package. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
