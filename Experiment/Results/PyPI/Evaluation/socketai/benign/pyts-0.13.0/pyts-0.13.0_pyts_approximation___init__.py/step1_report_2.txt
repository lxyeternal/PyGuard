{
  "purpose": "This module provides imports and exports for various time series approximation algorithms used in the pyts library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own directory structure to import specific classes (PiecewiseAggregateApproximation, SymbolicAggregateApproximation, DiscreteFourierTransform, MultipleCoefficientBinning, SymbolicFourierApproximation).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code only imports internal modules.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from internal modules and then exposes them via __all__, with no external data or untrusted input flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs present. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of specific classes from sibling modules and defines __all__ for export. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The structure is simple and standard for Python package modules, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module that manages imports for the pyts approximation algorithms. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as an import/export wrapper.",
