{
  "purpose": "This module imports and exports various approximation algorithms related to time series analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements for specific classes from local modules: .paa, .sax, .dft, .mcb, and .sfa.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or untrusted data handling observed; no sinks related to data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a straightforward import/export module with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures; the code is standard module import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements for internal modules and an __all__ declaration for public API exposure. There are no dynamic evaluations, network communications, or file operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module defining an API for time series approximation algorithms. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
