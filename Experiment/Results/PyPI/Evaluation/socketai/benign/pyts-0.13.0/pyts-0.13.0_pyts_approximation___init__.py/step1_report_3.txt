{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an import interface for various approximation algorithms within the pyts.approximation package, providing convenient access to specific classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module files: .paa, .sax, .dft, .mcb, .sfa",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and declares export symbols, with no data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to typical module structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from sibling modules, indicating modular design for approximation algorithms. It defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears purely structural, serving as an API interface without executing any logic or handling data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module interface with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security concerns. It strictly defines imports and exports, and does not process untrusted data.",
