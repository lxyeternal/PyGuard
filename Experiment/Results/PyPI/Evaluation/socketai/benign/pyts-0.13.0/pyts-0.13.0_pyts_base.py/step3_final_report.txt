{
  "purpose": "Mixin classes providing fit_transform and score methods for univariate/multivariate transformers and classifiers in pyts, facilitating standard ML workflows.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters (X, y), typically untrusted user input or datasets.",
  "sinks": "Calls to fit(), transform(), predict(), and accuracy_score(), which process data but do not involve external sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through fit/transform/predict methods, then to accuracy_score for evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, standard utility classes for ML estimators, relying on sklearn functions. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. Methods are simple wrappers adding fit_transform and score functionalities. No external or dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling, and no signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate. The high confidence score (1) reflects the straightforward nature of the code and the thorough analysis.",
