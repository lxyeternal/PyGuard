  "purpose": "Define mixin classes for univariate and multivariate transformers and classifiers in pyts, providing common fit_transform and score methods.",
  "sources": "Import of accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.",
  "sinks": "self.fit(), self.transform(), self.predict(), accuracy_score(y, ...)",
  "flows": "fit_transform methods -> self.fit() and self.transform(); score methods -> self.predict() and accuracy_score()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mixin classes that provide common methods for transformers and classifiers, such as fit_transform and score. It uses standard scikit-learn functions, such as accuracy_score, for evaluation. The methods involve straightforward data transformations and predictions, with no external network calls, file operations, or data leaks. The code appears well-structured and typical for machine learning utility classes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of mixin classes for machine learning estimators with no malicious behavior detected. It primarily facilitates data transformations and scoring, adhering to common practices.",
