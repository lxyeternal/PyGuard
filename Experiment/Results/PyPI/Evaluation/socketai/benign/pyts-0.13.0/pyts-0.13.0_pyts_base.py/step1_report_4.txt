{
  "purpose": "Define mixin classes for univariate/multivariate transformers and classifiers in pyts, providing fit_transform and score methods.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code reads class methods and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses accuracy_score with y and self.predict(X); no dangerous sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y) through fit_transform and score methods; no untrusted data sources leading to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mixin classes for data transformation and scoring, utilizing standard sklearn functions and well-documented methods. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices for machine learning components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of mixin classes for time series transformers and classifiers, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
