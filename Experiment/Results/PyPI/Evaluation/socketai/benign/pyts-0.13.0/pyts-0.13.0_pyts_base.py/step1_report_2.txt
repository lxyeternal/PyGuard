{
  "purpose": "Provide mixin classes for time series transformers and classifiers, mainly to add fit-transform and score functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from sklearn.metrics and class methods that utilize self.predict and fit.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self.predict(X) and self.fit() which are typical for classifiers and transformers.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows into fit and predict methods; results are used for transformations and accuracy scoring.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard mixin classes for machine learning models, adding fit_transform and score methods. The methods rely on existing, typical sklearn interfaces (self.fit(), self.transform(), self.predict()) and do not include any dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated code. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The imports and class structures are consistent with normal library development. The overall code is simple, transparent, and typical for ML utility classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of mixin classes for time series transformers and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present. It appears to be benign and intended for standard use in machine learning workflows.",
