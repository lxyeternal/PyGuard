{
  "purpose": "Provide mixin classes for univariate/multivariate transformers and classifiers in pyts, mainly for data transformation and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Code reads class methods, input parameters (X, y, sample_weight), and uses the 'accuracy_score' function from sklearn.metrics.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'accuracy_score' for evaluation, which processes predicted and true labels. No other data sinks or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, y) through fit_transform and score methods, with predictions made via self.predict(X), and results returned as scores.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No suspicious obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard mixin classes intended for data transformation and classification evaluation. The methods implement typical patterns for fit/transform and scoring. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. All operations involve standard data handling and sklearn functions. The code appears to be clean, straightforward, and consistent with typical machine learning utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility mixin classes with no malicious intent. No suspicious activity or malware detected. The code is safe and intended for typical ML workflows.",
