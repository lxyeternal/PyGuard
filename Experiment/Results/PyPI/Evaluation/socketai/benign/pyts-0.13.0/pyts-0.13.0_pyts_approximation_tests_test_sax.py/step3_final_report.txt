{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the SymbolicAggregateApproximation class, validating parameter handling and output correctness.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays used in tests, such as X and parameter dictionaries",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network calls, or file operations are present",
  "flows": "Input data and parameters flow into the class methods, with outputs compared to expected results",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation and correctness testing using pytest, with static data and no external dependencies beyond standard libraries and pyts. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The tests are straightforward, with expected exceptions for invalid parameters and output comparisons for valid inputs. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
