{
  "purpose": "Configure and validate settings for the django-rest-framework-simplejwt package, including handling of user-defined settings and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Reading Django settings (settings.SECRET_KEY, settings.SIMPLE_JWT), reading user settings passed to APISettings, and reading environment variables related to Django and DRF.",
  "sinks": "Potentially used when raising RuntimeError for removed settings, and when setting global api_settings based on changed settings.",
  "flows": "User settings are validated and merged with defaults, and on settings change signals, the global api_settings are reloaded based on new configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets aside from use of Django's SECRET_KEY, which is standard practice. No code injections, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The only potential concern is the raising of RuntimeError if deprecated settings are used, but this is standard for configuration validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages JWT configuration settings, validating user-provided settings against deprecated or removed options and reloading configuration dynamically when settings change. It uses standard Django practices for settings management and signal handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden malicious code is detected. The SECRET_KEY is used for signing tokens, which is typical in JWT implementations. The only notable feature is validation and dynamic reloading, which is benign and common in Django apps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management module for JWT settings in a Django project. It includes validation and dynamic reloading mechanisms but does not contain malicious behavior or security risks beyond normal configuration handling. No malware, suspicious code, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
