{
  "purpose": "Configure and validate settings for the django-rest-framework-simplejwt package, including handling user-specific settings and reloading configuration upon changes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from Django settings ('settings.SECRET_KEY', 'settings.SIMPLE_JWT') and user-defined configurations provided via the 'SIMPLE_JWT' setting.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the 'api_settings' object used elsewhere in the application; no direct data sinks are present, but configuration affects JWT behavior.",
  "flows": "Sources (settings.SECRET_KEY, SIMPLE_JWT) are used to initialize 'api_settings'. When 'SIMPLE_JWT' setting changes, 'reload_api_settings' updates 'api_settings'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code mainly manages configurations. No hardcoded secrets other than referencing 'settings.SECRET_KEY'. No obfuscation or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code sets default JWT configuration parameters, retrieves user settings, and provides a mechanism to reload settings dynamically when they change. It validates that removed settings are not used, raising errors if they are. The code uses standard Django and DRF mechanisms for configuration management. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of 'settings.SECRET_KEY' is standard for signing tokens, which is expected behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a standard configuration setup without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code manages JWT configuration settings securely and transparently, with proper validation and reload mechanisms. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The code is standard for JWT setup within a Django project.",
