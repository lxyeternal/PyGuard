  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code manages JWT settings in Django, referencing SECRET_KEY for signing tokens.\n- It validates settings against deprecated options.\n- It supports dynamic reloading via Django signals.\n- No hardcoded credentials beyond SECRET_KEY.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code detected.\n- The use of SECRET_KEY is standard but sensitive.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Standard configuration management.\n- No anomalies, no malicious code, no suspicious data leaks.\n- Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, managing settings with validation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- The use of SECRET_KEY is standard.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- The assigned scores seem appropriate.\n- **Risk score (0)** is justified.\n- **Malware score (0)** is correct.\n- **Obfuscated (0)** is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar purpose, with validation and dynamic reload.\n- No suspicious code, only standard validation.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2), possibly due to handling SECRET_KEY.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No malicious behavior.\n- The use of SECRET_KEY is typical but sensitive.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- Scores seem reasonable.\n- **Malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **securityRisk = 0.2** is justified given SECRET_KEY handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar analysis, emphasizing configuration management.\n- No signs of malicious code.\n- Scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- Use of SECRET_KEY is standard.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar to previous, standard JWT configuration.\n- Use of SECRET_KEY for signing.\n- No malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The use of SECRET_KEY is expected.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Same as above, validation, dynamic reload, no malicious code.\n- Slightly more emphasis on validation.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Use of SECRET_KEY is standard.\n\n**Score suggestion:**\n\n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points across all reports:**\n\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Use of SECRET_KEY for signing tokens is standard in Django JWT implementations.\n- Validation of settings and dynamic reloads are standard practices.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to handling SECRET_KEY, which is sensitive, but this is standard practice)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard JWT configuration module in Django. It manages sensitive data appropriately, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure SECRET_KEY remains confidential and is managed securely outside of code review. The code itself does not introduce security risks beyond standard practices.",
