  "purpose": "Manage JWT settings in a Django project, including validation, default configuration, and dynamic reloading.",
  "sources": "Django settings (SECRET_KEY, user overrides), Django signals for reloads",
  "sinks": "Use of SECRET_KEY for signing tokens (sensitive data), validation errors on deprecated settings",
  "flows": "Settings read from Django config -> validation checks -> SECRET_KEY used in signing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets beyond SECRET_KEY, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code manages JWT configuration securely, validates against deprecated options, and supports dynamic updates via signals. It uses SECRET_KEY for signing, which is standard but sensitive. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented JWT configuration module in Django, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain risks. The use of SECRET_KEY is appropriate and typical, with a low security risk score. The assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
