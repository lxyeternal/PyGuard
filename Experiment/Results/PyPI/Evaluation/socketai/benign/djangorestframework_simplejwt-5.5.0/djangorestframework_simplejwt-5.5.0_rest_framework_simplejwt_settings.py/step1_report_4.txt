{
  "purpose": "The code configures and manages settings for the 'rest_framework_simplejwt' package, handling default values, user-defined overrides, and dynamic reloading of settings within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reads Django project settings ('settings.SIMPLE_JWT', 'settings.SECRET_KEY') and signals for setting changes.",
  "sinks": "Uses SECRET_KEY as the signing key for tokens, which is a sensitive data source; no other untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Retrieves user settings; validates against removed settings; applies defaults; dynamically reloads settings on change signals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (other than SECRET_KEY which is standard in Django), or obfuscated code. The SECRET_KEY is a potential sensitive source but is expected in Django environments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration defaults for JWT token handling, ensuring that sensitive information like SECRET_KEY is used appropriately for signing tokens. It validates user overrides against deprecated settings, preventing misconfiguration. The dynamic reload via signals appears standard in Django. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The use of SECRET_KEY is standard but constitutes a sensitive data source; however, it is expected for JWT signing in Django. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management module for JWT in Django, with proper validation and dynamic reloading. There is no malicious intent detected. The use of SECRET_KEY is expected but should be managed securely. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
