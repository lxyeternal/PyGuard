  "purpose": "Configure and manage settings for the Django REST Framework SimpleJWT package, including default token settings and dynamic reloading.",
  "sources": "Reading Django settings ('settings.SECRET_KEY', 'settings.SIMPLE_JWT'), environment variables, and configuration inputs from user.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection or misuse if settings are manipulated improperly, but no direct data leaks or harmful actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Loading settings from Django config → Validation against removed settings → Updating global api_settings on change events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials beyond standard SECRET_KEY; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Use of runtime settings validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code manages JWT configuration settings, validates user-provided settings against deprecated options, and allows for dynamic updates upon settings change. No malicious data flows or backdoors are present. The use of SECRET_KEY is standard for signing tokens, and there are no signs of malicious injections or external network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured configuration management for JWT settings in Django. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are evident. The main concern could be if the SECRET_KEY is exposed elsewhere, but within this code, it is used as intended.",
