  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as implementing standard JWT token workflows in Django REST Framework.\n- No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious external calls are identified.\n- The code employs standard practices: user authentication, token creation/refresh/validation, optional blacklisting, exception handling.\n- The logic is consistent with legitimate authentication modules, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code behavior:** The code's logic matches typical JWT authentication workflows. All token handling, user validation, and blacklisting are standard and expected.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No evidence of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious external calls.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No evident bugs or flaws in logic. Exception handling around optional features (blacklist) is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Secrets or hardcoded credentials:** Not observed.\n- **External network activity:** Limited to Django/DRF functions and models; no suspicious external network calls.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code uses `try-except` blocks to handle optional blacklisting support, which is standard.\n- Token blacklisting is conditional and safe.\n- Token payload access and user validation follow best practices.\n- No assumptions or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n| -------- | --------- | ----------- | ----- |\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 |\n| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 |\n| 4 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 |\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated = 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- Risk scores are low (0.2), indicating minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Any scores > 0.5?\n- None. All are appropriately low, reflecting no significant risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — justified, given the code's standard and secure practices.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented JWT authentication module for Django REST Framework, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reported scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
