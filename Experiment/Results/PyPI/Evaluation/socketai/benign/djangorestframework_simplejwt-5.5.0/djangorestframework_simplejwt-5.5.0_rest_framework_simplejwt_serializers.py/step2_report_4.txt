  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes standard token authentication via DRF serializers, reading user input and tokens.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies token creation, validation, and blacklisting as sinks; flow description aligns with code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Use of try-except for optional blacklist is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes no malicious activity, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — aligns with analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — low, given the standard implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing JWT handling, token blacklisting, and standard practices.  \n- No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, proper exception handling.  \n- Confidence at 0.9, malware at 0, obfuscated at 0.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on JWT token management, input validation, token refresh, blacklisting, and standard security practices.  \n- No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar observations: standard token workflows, safe exception handling, no malicious patterns.  \n- No suspicious external calls or hidden behavior.  \n- Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Emphasizes standard practices, safe token handling, conditional blacklisting, no malicious activity.  \n- No signs of backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- Confidence 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across all reports, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to standard token handling complexity and optional features.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores given in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, given the reliance on standard libraries, optional features, and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, secure implementation of JWT token handling in Django REST Framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks beyond the minimal, acceptable level for such functionality.",
