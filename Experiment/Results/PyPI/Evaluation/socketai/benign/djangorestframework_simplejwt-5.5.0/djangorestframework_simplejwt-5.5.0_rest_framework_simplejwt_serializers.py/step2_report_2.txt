  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe standard JWT token management workflows in Django REST Framework.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are mentioned.\n- Exception handling around optional features like blacklisting is standard.\n- No suspicious external calls, network activity, or hidden behaviors are indicated.\n- The code relies on established Django and DRF libraries and patterns.\n- The reports consistently assign malware scores of 0 and low security risks (~0.2), indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are explicitly identified in the code snippets or reports.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports suggest any malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports confirm code clarity, with obfuscation scores at 0.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only noted concerns are standard security considerations (e.g., blacklisting, token expiry), which are handled appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis & Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score (~0.2):** Slightly above zero, reflecting typical risks associated with token handling (e.g., token theft, misuse). This is reasonable given the context, but no specific vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The code adheres to best practices, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The use of try-except blocks around optional features like blacklisting is standard and safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond standard security considerations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nBased on the comprehensive review:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.2** — aligns with typical token handling risks; no specific issues.\n\n**Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of JWT token management in Django REST Framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.**",
