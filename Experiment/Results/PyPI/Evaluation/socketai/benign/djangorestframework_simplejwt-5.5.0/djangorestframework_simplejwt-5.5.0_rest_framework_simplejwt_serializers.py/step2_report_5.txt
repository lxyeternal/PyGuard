  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting typical concerns around token handling but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Validity\n- The code snippets are consistent with standard Django REST Framework JWT implementations.\n- No suspicious or malicious code segments, secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n- The token blacklisting logic is optional and implemented with proper exception handling, which is standard practice.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes\n- No apparent errors or flaws in the code logic.\n- The use of `try-except` around optional features like blacklisting is appropriate.\n- The validation flows and token handling follow best practices.\n\n### Score Justifications\n- **Malware Score (0):** No malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk (0.2):** Slight concern due to token handling, but this is standard; the low score is justified.\n\n### Potential Inconsistencies or Overestimations\n- The reports' high confidence (0.9) and the scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No changes needed for the scores based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (appropriate, given the context)\n- **Overall:** The code is a typical, secure JWT implementation with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the actual security posture of the code. No adjustments necessary.",
