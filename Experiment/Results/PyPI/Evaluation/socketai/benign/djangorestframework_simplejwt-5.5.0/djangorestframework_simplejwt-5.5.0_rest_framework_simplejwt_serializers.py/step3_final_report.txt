{
  "purpose": "Provides JWT token management, including obtaining, refreshing, verifying, and blacklisting tokens for Django REST Framework authentication.",
  "sources": "User input fields (username, password, token strings), token payloads, request context, optional blacklist models.",
  "sinks": "Token creation and validation functions, blacklist operations, user authentication checks, token payload access.",
  "flows": "Input data (credentials or tokens) -> validation and authentication -> token generation or refresh -> optional blacklisting -> output tokens or validation results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious external calls detected. Use of try-except around optional blacklisting features is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JWT authentication serializers with proper exception handling, token management, and optional blacklisting support. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The token handling follows best practices, and the code is clear and maintainable. The security risk is minimal, primarily associated with token management, which is inherent to such systems but does not indicate vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of JWT authentication in Django REST Framework. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is low. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
