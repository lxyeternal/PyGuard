{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the version information of the 'djangorestframework_simplejwt' package if installed.",
  "sources": "The 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata', and the package name string 'djangorestframework_simplejwt'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data or sensitive information beyond assigning version info to a variable.",
  "flows": "Input source: package name string used in 'version' function; Output: the version string or None assigned to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'PackageNotFoundError' and 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' to check for the presence and version of a specific package. It attempts to retrieve the package version, and if the package is not installed, it assigns None to '__version__'. This pattern is common and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package version check with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It safely handles the case where the package is not installed. No malicious intent or security concerns are evident.",
