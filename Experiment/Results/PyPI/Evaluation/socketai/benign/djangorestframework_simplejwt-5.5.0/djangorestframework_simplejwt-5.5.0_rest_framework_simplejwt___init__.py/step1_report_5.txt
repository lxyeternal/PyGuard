  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the version of the 'djangorestframework_simplejwt' package if installed, or sets __version__ to None if not found.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version information from importlib.metadata for 'djangorestframework_simplejwt'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading package metadata to assign to __version__, with no external data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The try-except structure is standard for handling missing packages.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple check for the presence of a specific package and retrieves its version, handling the exception if the package is not installed. No external inputs, data leakage, or suspicious behavior are evident. Usage of importlib.metadata is standard and does not involve malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, standard, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It serves a benign purpose of package version checking with proper exception handling.",
