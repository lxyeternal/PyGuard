  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation**:\n   - The code attempts to retrieve the version of the `'djangorestframework_simplejwt'` package using `importlib.metadata.version`.\n   - If the package isn't installed, it catches `PackageNotFoundError` and sets `__version__` to `None`.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard, and does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign package presence and version check.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The exception handling is appropriate for optional dependencies.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the straightforwardness.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Malware Score**:\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0; no malicious activity is present.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution.\n   - The risk score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment and Recommendations**:\n- The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency checking.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Personal Estimation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis provided in all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, performs a common task, and presents no security concerns. The scoring across all reports is accurate and justified.",
