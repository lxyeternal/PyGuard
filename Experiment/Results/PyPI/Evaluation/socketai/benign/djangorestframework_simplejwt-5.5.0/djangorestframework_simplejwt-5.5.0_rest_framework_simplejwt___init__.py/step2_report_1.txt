  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: attempting to retrieve the version of 'djangorestframework_simplejwt' via importlib.metadata, with exception handling if the package isn't installed.\n- The analysis in each report consistently states that the code is benign, straightforward, and uses standard library functions without malicious intent.\n- The reported scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and correctly described.\n- **Functionality:** It attempts to get the package version safely.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; the code is simple and standard.\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — justified, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — justified, no security issues are evident.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code only performs a benign package version check, the risk is minimal.\n- The only potential concern could be if the package name was dynamically manipulated or if the code was part of a larger malicious chain, but based solely on this snippet, there's no such indication.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Scores:** The current scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Potential for higher scores:** Only if the code involved dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious obfuscation, which it does not.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's a standard check, but even this could be considered minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The current scoring accurately reflects this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as harmless. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
