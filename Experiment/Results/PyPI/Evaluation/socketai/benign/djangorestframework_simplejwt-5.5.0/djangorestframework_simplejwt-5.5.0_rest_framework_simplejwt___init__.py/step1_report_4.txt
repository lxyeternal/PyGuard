{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'djangorestframework_simplejwt' package if installed.",
  "sources": "The 'version' function from 'importlib.metadata' which reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'version' to get package info; if package not found, sets version to None.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code straightforwardly retrieves package version with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'PackageNotFoundError' and 'version' from 'importlib.metadata'. It attempts to get the installed version of 'djangorestframework_simplejwt'. If the package is not installed, it catches the exception and assigns None to '__version__'. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is simple, and the logic is standard for optional dependency checks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe implementation for checking package version and handles missing package scenario gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
