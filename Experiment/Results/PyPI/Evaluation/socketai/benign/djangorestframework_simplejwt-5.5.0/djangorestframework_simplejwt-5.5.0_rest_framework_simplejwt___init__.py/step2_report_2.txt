  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing `version` and `PackageNotFoundError` from `importlib.metadata`, attempting to retrieve the version of `'djangorestframework_simplejwt'`, and handling the exception by setting `__version__` to `None`.\n- The code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and includes proper exception handling.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present across all reports.\n- The purpose is benign: checking for package presence and version info.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is correct and performs a simple, safe check.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are identified in the code itself.\n   - The reports correctly identify that no anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Analysis of scores:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n   - The scores for malware and security risk are consistent with the analysis.\n\n3. **Potential concerns or assumptions:**\n   - The reports mention no suspicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency checking.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores:**\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious activity is detected, the risk scores should remain very low, ideally zero.\n   - The malware score is zero because there's no evidence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is zero because the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score is zero, as the code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential discrepancies or overestimations:**\n   - All reports seem consistent and reasonable.\n   - No report overstates the risk or malware likelihood.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, and the scores should reflect that.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | 0               |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippet is a standard, safe package version check with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and should not be adjusted upward.",
