  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points; only setting a variable based on package presence.",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version (source), handle exception if package missing, assign None (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply checks for package presence and captures version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'version' and 'PackageNotFoundError' from 'importlib.metadata'. It attempts to retrieve the version of a specific package, and if the package isn't installed, it catches the exception and sets the version variable to None. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code execution, or hidden backdoors. The code performs a straightforward check for package presence and version info. No use of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to check for package installation and version info, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
