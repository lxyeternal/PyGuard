  "purpose": "To safely retrieve the version of the 'djangorestframework_simplejwt' package if installed, or set to None if not.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version and importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks",
  "flows": "Attempt to get package version (source) -> exception handling (sink) sets __version__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions with proper exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports version retrieval functions from importlib.metadata, attempts to get the version of a specific package, and handles the case where the package is not installed. It performs a benign, standard check without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code is clear and straightforward. No anomalies or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package version check with proper exception handling. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are accurate and justified.",
