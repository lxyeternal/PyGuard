  "purpose": "Define a stateless user class 'TokenUser' that acts as a proxy for token-based user data within a JWT authentication system.",
  "sources": "Token data accessed via self.token (e.g., self.token[api_settings.USER_ID_CLAIM], self.token.get(...))",
  "sinks": "Methods accessing token data, properties retrieving user attributes from token, __getattr__ for additional claims",
  "flows": "Token data flows from self.token into user attributes (id, username, is_staff, is_superuser), and __getattr__ allows dynamic access to claims",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The class is a straightforward proxy for token claims. No data leaks or unsafe operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'TokenUser' class that models a user based on JWT token claims. It uses cached_property for attributes like id, username, is_staff, and is_superuser, retrieving values from the token dictionary using keys from api_settings or direct get() calls. Methods related to user permissions and database operations raise NotImplementedError, consistent with a stateless token approach. The __getattr__ method provides flexible access to additional token claims. The code appears secure, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The token data is used solely for user attribute access without unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a token-based user proxy, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It correctly avoids database interactions and handles token claims safely. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
