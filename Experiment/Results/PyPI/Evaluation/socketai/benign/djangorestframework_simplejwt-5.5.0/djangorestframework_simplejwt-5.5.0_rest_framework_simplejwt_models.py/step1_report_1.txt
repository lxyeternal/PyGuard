{
  "purpose": "Defines a dummy user class (TokenUser) used for stateless JWT authentication, acting as a stand-in for Django's user model with token-backed attributes.",
  "sources": "Token object passed during initialization, token claims accessed via self.token, environment variables not used, external data sources not present.",
  "sinks": "Methods that return token data (e.g., id, username, permissions) could potentially leak token claims if misused, but do not perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Token claims are retrieved from self.token in various properties, with no modification or external data influence; mainly read access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. Methods raising NotImplementedError are standard for token-based users.",
  "analysis": "The class acts as a simple, stateless user wrapper for token claims, avoiding database interactions. It retrieves data directly from token claims, which is typical in JWT implementations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. No suspicious network calls, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears standard, purpose-specific, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a stateless user model for JWT tokens, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation, with no evident security issues.",
