{
  "purpose": "Defines a dummy user class TokenUser for use with JWT-based authentication, representing stateless user objects backed by tokens.",
  "sources": "Reads token data via self.token and token.get() method.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data flows to external systems or insecure outputs.",
  "flows": "Token data is accessed directly in properties and __getattr__, no external or untrusted data output is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The class acts as a simple wrapper around token data.",
  "analysis": "The class uses token data to simulate a user object with properties like id, username, is_staff, etc. It primarily reads token claims and provides standard user interface methods. No external network calls, data leaks, or code injection points are present. It follows typical design for token-based user objects and contains no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, acting as a wrapper around JWT token claims to emulate a user object in Django. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks identified.",
