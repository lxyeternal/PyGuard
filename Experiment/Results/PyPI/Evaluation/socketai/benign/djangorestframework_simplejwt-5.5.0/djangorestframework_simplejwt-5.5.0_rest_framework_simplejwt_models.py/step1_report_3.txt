{
  "purpose": "Defines a stateless user class for JWT token authentication, mimicking Django's AnonymousUser, to facilitate token-based user identity representation.",
  "sources": "Token data accessed via self.token and api_settings.USER_ID_CLAIM; token claims used in id and username properties.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not write to external systems, network, or filesystem.",
  "flows": "Token claims (e.g., USER_ID_CLAIM, username, is_staff, is_superuser) flow into class attributes for user identification and permission checks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of cached_property for token claims is standard; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic. No unusual or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dummy user object that relies solely on token claims to simulate user properties. It does not perform any I/O, network calls, or security-sensitive operations beyond reading token data. All methods are standard, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The absence of sensitive hardcoded data or dynamic code execution reduces suspicion. The design aligns with common JWT authentication patterns. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a stateless token-based user class with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely interprets token claims without executing any external or harmful actions.",
