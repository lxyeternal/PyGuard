{
  "purpose": "A stateless user class backed by JWT token claims, providing user attributes without database interaction.",
  "sources": "Token object, claims accessed via self.token",
  "sinks": "No harmful data leaks or external system interactions",
  "flows": "Read-only access from token claims to user properties",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of a token-backed user proxy. It reads token claims directly, with no external calls or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The methods raise NotImplementedError for database operations, indicating statelessness. The properties access token data safely and efficiently. The overall design aligns with common JWT authentication patterns and poses no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and purpose-specific. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
