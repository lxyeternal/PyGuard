{
  "purpose": "Define a stateless user class (TokenUser) that represents authenticated users based on JWT tokens, mainly for use in JWT authentication backend.",
  "sources": "Token data accessed via self.token in __init__, id, username, is_staff, is_superuser, and __getattr__ method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data directly influences system actions, system calls, or data leaks; __getattr__ allows dynamic access but only to token data.",
  "flows": "Token data flows from self.token into properties like id, username, is_staff, is_superuser, and dynamic attribute retrieval via __getattr__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The class acts as a simple wrapper for token data with no malicious behavior. No encryption, obfuscation, or unsafe code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a dummy user class based on token data, avoiding database interactions. It relies solely on token claims to provide user attributes. The class is designed for stateless authentication, with methods raising NotImplementedError for DB operations, indicating no risk of malicious DB access. No suspicious or malicious code, code injection, or obfuscation patterns are present. The only dynamic access is through token claims via __getattr__, which is controlled and limited to token data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, acting as a simple token-backed user object for JWT authentication. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The implementation is straightforward and secure.",
