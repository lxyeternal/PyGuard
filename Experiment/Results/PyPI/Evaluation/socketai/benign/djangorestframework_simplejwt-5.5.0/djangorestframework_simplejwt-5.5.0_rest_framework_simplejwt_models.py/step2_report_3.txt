  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes a stateless, token-backed user class similar to Django's AnonymousUser, used for SSO across services sharing a secret key.\n- **Sources:** Token object, claims accessed via self.token.\n- **Sinks:** No harmful outputs, just token data retrieval.\n- **Flows:** Read-only access to token claims.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the class is a simple, safe wrapper for token claims, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 — perhaps slightly high, but since it's a simple wrapper, this is acceptable.  \n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, a dummy user class for JWT tokens.\n- **Sources:** Token data via self.token.\n- **Sinks:** No data leaks or external system interactions.\n- **Flows:** Token claims are accessed directly.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The class is a benign wrapper, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — very low, consistent with a simple token wrapper.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, a stateless user class based on JWT token claims.\n- **Sources:** Token claims via self.token.\n- **Sinks:** No external actions.\n- **Flows:** Token claims into user properties.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward token claim wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound, and scores align.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar token-backed user class.\n- **Sources:** Token data accessed via self.token.\n- **Sinks:** No external or unsafe outputs.\n- **Flows:** Token claims into user attributes.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The class is a safe, simple proxy for token claims, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — consistent with a simple, safe wrapper.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard token-based user proxy.\n- **Sources:** Token claims.\n- **Sinks:** No unsafe outputs.\n- **Flows:** Token claims into user attributes.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The class is a typical, safe implementation with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0 — fully justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low across all, mostly 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal risk from a stateless token wrapper.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the straightforward, read-only, token-based nature of the class.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly because it deals with token data, which could be sensitive if tokens are compromised, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, safe implementation of a token-backed user proxy with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code appears secure, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
