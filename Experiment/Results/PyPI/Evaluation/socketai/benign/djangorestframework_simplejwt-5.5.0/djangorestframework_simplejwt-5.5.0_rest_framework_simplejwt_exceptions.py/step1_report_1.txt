  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for token-related errors and a mixin class for detailed error responses in a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, django.utils.translation, rest_framework.exceptions, rest_framework.status, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "The classes are used to generate and handle exceptions with detailed messages; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Exception classes follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions for token errors, a mixin to construct detailed error responses, and an API exception class. The mixin handles optional detail and code attributes to generate structured error messages. All code aligns with standard practices for error handling in Django REST Framework. No malicious or suspicious behaviors observed, no external calls, no dynamic code execution or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes and a mixin for detailed error reporting. No signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
