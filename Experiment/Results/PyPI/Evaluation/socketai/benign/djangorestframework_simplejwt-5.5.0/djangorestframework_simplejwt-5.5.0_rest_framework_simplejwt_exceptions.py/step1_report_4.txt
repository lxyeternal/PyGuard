{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and a mixin class for handling error details in a Django REST Framework authentication context.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; primarily class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "Super call in DetailDictMixin constructor which passes a detail dictionary to the base Exception class.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flows into the sink; data used in exception handling is internal or controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard exception and class inheritance patterns for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for token errors and an error detail mixin for API responses, extending Django and DRF exception classes. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The 'super().__init__(detail_dict)' call is standard for exception message passing. No obfuscated code, network activity, or system modification features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom error classes for a Django REST API, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears to be standard, safe, and focused solely on error handling.",
