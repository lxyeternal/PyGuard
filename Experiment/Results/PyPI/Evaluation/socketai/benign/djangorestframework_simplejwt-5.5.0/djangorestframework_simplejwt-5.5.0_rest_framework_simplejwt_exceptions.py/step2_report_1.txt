  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes related to token errors, with a mixin for detailed error responses.\n- The code uses standard Python, Django, and DRF patterns.\n- No external data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The exception classes inherit appropriately; the mixin constructs error details into a dictionary and passes it to the base Exception class.\n- The use of `gettext_lazy` indicates internationalization support.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard custom exceptions and a mixin for detailed errors.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, no security risks.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining custom exceptions and a mixin.  \n- Conclusion: Standard implementation, no malicious behavior.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Similar, with more token-specific exceptions.  \n- Noted: Slightly higher `securityRisk` score (0.1), possibly due to the focus on token errors, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious code.  \n- Justification: Token error handling is common; unless there's a specific flaw, the risk remains low.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.1 seems acceptable given the context, but could be lowered to 0 since no vulnerabilities are detected.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, no external data or malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Similar, no suspicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Standard, safe implementation.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk score: 0  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identified no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identified no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk scores:** Given the code is purely for error handling, the risk should be minimal. The only slight concern was in Report 3, which assigned 0.1. This is acceptable but could be lowered to 0, as no vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent and accurate)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (consistent and accurate)  \n- **Risk score:** I would set all to 0, given the code is standard and safe. The minor 0.1 in Report 3 can be justified if considering token error handling as a potential surface, but since no actual vulnerability exists, 0 is more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions and error handling in a Django REST Framework context. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behaviors are detected. The scores given are reasonable, with the minor exception of Report 3's 0.1 risk score, which I recommend lowering to 0.**\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**This aligns with the code's nature and the analysis provided.**",
