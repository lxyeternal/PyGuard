  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and error handling classes for token authentication in a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing, Django translation, and REST Framework exceptions; class definitions and their methods.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(detail_dict) in DetailDictMixin constructor, which passes data to the base Exception class.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (detail, code) flow into detail_dict, which then flows into the Exception superclass.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no data leaks, no unusual behaviors. Use of translation function (_), standard exception inheritance, and a clean class design.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for token-related errors, including ExpiredTokenError, TokenBackendError, and others, with detailed messages and inheritance structures. The DetailDictMixin provides structured error details, and the AuthenticationFailed class adds a specific default message for invalid tokens. The use of Django's translation utility suggests internationalization support. The overall structure and content appear standard for Django REST Framework error handling, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage. There are no suspicious network calls, data manipulations, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for token error handling in a Django REST Framework app. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears safe, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.",
