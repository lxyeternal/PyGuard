  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code defines custom exception classes related to token errors, with a mixin for detailed error responses.\n- No external data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Exception classes follow standard patterns.\n- Use of Django translation functions indicates internationalization support.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Standard custom exceptions and a mixin for detailed error responses.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception and mixin definitions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Defines token-related exceptions, including expiration and backend errors, with internationalization.\n- **Findings:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) possibly due to the inclusion of multiple exception types.\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** The code handles token errors but does not introduce any vulnerability or malicious behavior. The minor risk score might reflect the importance of token error handling in security contexts, but it's not inherently risky.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; the score seems reasonable.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard error classes.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard exception handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Most are 0, with one at 0.1 (Report 3). Given the code's nature, even the 0.1 is just a minimal risk indication due to token error handling, not actual vulnerability.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exceptions and error handling in Django REST Framework.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- Scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, maintainable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities present)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is safe, standard, and aligned with best practices for error handling in Django REST Framework applications.",
