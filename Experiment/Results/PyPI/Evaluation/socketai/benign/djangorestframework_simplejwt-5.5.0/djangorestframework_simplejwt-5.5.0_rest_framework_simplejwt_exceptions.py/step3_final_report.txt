  "purpose": "Defines custom token error exceptions and a mixin for detailed error responses in Django REST Framework.",
  "sources": "Class initializations and exception raising points within the code, primarily during error handling and class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(detail_dict) where error details are passed to the base Exception class.",
  "flows": "From instantiation of exception classes with optional detail and code, passing structured error info to the base class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python, Django, and DRF patterns. It defines exception classes for token errors, with a mixin to construct detailed error responses, including internationalization support. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present. The exception hierarchy is conventional, and the use of gettext_lazy indicates proper internationalization practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears unjustified given the code's nature, which is purely for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions and error handling in a Django REST Framework context. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with the minor risk score in one report recommended to be lowered to zero. Overall, the code poses no security risks and aligns with best practices.",
