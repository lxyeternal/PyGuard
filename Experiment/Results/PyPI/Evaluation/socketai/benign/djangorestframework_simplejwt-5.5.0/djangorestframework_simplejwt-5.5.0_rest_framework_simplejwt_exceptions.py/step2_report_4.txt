  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes for token errors and a mixin for detailed error responses.\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor concern noted is a \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 3, which seems to be an overestimation given the absence of any risky code or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches standard Django REST Framework patterns. No issues or errors are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution.\n- **External data handling:** No external inputs or network calls.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None detected; the code handles errors gracefully and securely.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0, which aligns with the absence of security issues.\n\n**Note on report 3's \"securityRisk\":**  \nA score of 0.1 seems unjustified. The code is standard error handling without any risky behavior. I would suggest lowering this to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations per report:\n\n- **Reports 1, 2, 4, 5:**  \n  They correctly identify the code as standard, safe, and without malicious intent. Their scores are reasonable.\n\n- **Report 3:**  \n  Slightly higher \"securityRisk\" score (0.1). Given the analysis, I recommend reducing this to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exceptions and error handling for a Django REST Framework application. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that future modifications do not introduce external data handling or dynamic code execution that could elevate these scores.",
