  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and a mixin for detailed error reporting related to token authentication in Django REST Framework.",
  "sources": "Standard Python exception classes, Django translation utilities, and DRF exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(detail_dict) potentially passes untrusted data if detail or code is manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'detail' and 'code' flow into detail_dict, which is then passed to the base Exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for token errors with structured detail handling, including translation support. The DetailDictMixin allows flexible error details, but it simply constructs a dictionary from inputs and passes it to the Exception base class. There is no evident data leakage, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. Usage of Django's gettext_lazy is standard for localization. The code appears to be a typical, safe error-handling module for Django REST Framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions and error detail handling for token-related errors. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
