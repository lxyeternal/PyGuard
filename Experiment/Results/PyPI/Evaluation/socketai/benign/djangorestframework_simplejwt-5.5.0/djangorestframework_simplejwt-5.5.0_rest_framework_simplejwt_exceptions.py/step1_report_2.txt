  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a mixin for handling detailed error responses related to token authentication in a Django REST Framework context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for exception classes, particularly the 'detail' and 'code' parameters in DetailDictMixin constructor.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(detail_dict) which passes error details to the base Exception class.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (detail, code) flow into detail_dict, which is then passed to the base Exception.__init__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several exception classes for token errors, including expiration and invalid token errors, with a mixin for detailed error messaging. The mixin constructs a detailed error dictionary, optionally including custom detail and code. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The code adheres to standard practices for error handling in Django REST Framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions and error detail handling for token authentication, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior detected.",
