  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications, scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom token error exceptions and a mixin for detailed error responses. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues here. The score of 0 for malware and security risk is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception classes and a mixin for error details. No suspicious activity or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines token error exceptions, including expiration and backend errors, with internationalization support. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.1.\n\n**Analysis:** The only deviation is a small securityRisk score of 0.1. Given the code is purely for exception handling and error messaging, this seems overly cautious. No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity justifies even a minor risk score.\n\n**Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be 0, aligning with the rest of the reports and the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard exception and mixin classes with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard exception classes, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis and Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with malware=0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** The only questionable score is in Report 3, which has a small securityRisk=0.1. Given the code's nature—defining exceptions and error handling—there's no justification for any security risk.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks present)\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of custom exceptions and error detail handling in Django REST Framework. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident. The only minor inconsistency is the small securityRisk score in Report 3, which should be adjusted to 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with the code's content. The overall security posture is very safe, with no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
