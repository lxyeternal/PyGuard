  "finalAssessment": "The code is a standard implementation of JWT token management views in Django REST Framework, utilizing dynamic import for serializers via 'import_string'. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The primary concern is the potential risk if configuration is compromised, but in controlled environments, this pattern is common and safe. The low risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects this controlled risk. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and aligns with best practices, with no need for adjustments.",
