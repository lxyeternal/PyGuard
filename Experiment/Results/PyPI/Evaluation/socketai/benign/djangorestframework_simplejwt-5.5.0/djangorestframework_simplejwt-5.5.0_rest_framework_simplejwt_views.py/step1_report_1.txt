  "purpose": "This code provides Django REST Framework views for JWT token management, including obtaining, refreshing, verifying, and blacklisting tokens.",
  "sources": "The only dynamic data source is the import_string function which loads serializer classes based on configuration.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to or execute untrusted data directly; it handles request data through serializers and configuration settings.",
  "flows": "Request data flows into serializers for validation; serializer classes are dynamically imported from settings; no external or untrusted data output flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_string to dynamically import serializer classes based on configuration. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are observed. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple view classes for JWT token operations, relying on serializers specified in application settings. Dynamic import via import_string could introduce risks if settings are misconfigured, but it is a standard pattern in Django projects. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. No external network calls or system modifications are present. The logic appears to be straightforward token management with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of JWT token management views for Django REST Framework. It dynamically loads serializer classes based on configuration but does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. Overall, it appears safe and consistent with standard practices.",
