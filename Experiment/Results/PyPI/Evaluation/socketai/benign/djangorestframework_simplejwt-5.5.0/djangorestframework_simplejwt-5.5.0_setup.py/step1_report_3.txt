{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, specifically 'djangorestframework_simplejwt'. It defines dependencies, metadata, and package configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the long description from 'README.rst', package discovery via find_packages, and static dependency declarations in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data sources are static files or predefined dependencies. No network, file, or environment variable writes are directly involved in this code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static files and setting up package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters without processing untrusted inputs or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The script performs standard setup operations without suspicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses well-known setuptools functions to configure packaging. It reads the 'README.rst' file for long description, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and sets metadata. All operations are typical for a Python package setup. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, network communication, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines project metadata and dependencies for distribution. There is a very low likelihood of malicious intent.",
