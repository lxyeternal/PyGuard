{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'djangorestframework_simplejwt', including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long_description; input dependencies in extras_require and install_requires; package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "Reading file 'README.rst' for long_description; defining dependencies; setting package metadata.",
  "flows": "Path reading 'README.rst' -> assigning to long_description; dependencies in extras_require and install_requires used during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code. The dynamic reading of 'README.rst' is standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package configuration using setuptools. It reads the 'README.rst' file for the description, defines various optional dependencies, and configures package metadata such as name, version, URL, author info, requirements, classifiers, etc. The code uses standard practices for Python packaging. No code execution beyond reading a file occurs, and no external network activity or malicious patterns are present. The dependencies specified are typical for a Django REST Framework project and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It follows common packaging conventions without any suspicious patterns.",
