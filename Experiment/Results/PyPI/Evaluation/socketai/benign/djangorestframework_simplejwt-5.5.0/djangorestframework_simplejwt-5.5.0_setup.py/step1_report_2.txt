{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'djangorestframework_simplejwt', including its dependencies and metadata, for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long_description; reading dependencies listed in install_requires and extras_require; extracting package info via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; data is used for package configuration and metadata. No untrusted data handling or external network operations.",
  "flows": "Data read from 'README.rst' flows into 'long_description'; dependencies and metadata flow into 'setup()' for package configuration; no external data flows or untrusted inputs processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code strictly performs package setup tasks. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard modules and defines dependency groups for package extras. It reads a local file ('README.rst') for description and configures package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and package discovery. The dependencies appear legitimate for a Django REST Framework JWT plugin. There are no suspicious behaviors, network connections, or hidden code elements. The code conforms to standard Python packaging practices and does not include any malicious or maliciously obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It follows common patterns for Python package setup and dependency management.",
