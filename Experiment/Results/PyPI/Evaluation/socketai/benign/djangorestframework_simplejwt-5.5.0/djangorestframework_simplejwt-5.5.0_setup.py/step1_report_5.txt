{
  "purpose": "To set up the package configuration and dependencies for the 'djangorestframework_simplejwt' Python package, facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Path('README.rst').read_text(encoding='utf-8') reads the long description from an external file; the rest are static strings and lists defining dependencies, package info, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; all data sources are static or controlled file reads, and dependencies are specified with version constraints.",
  "flows": "The code reads a README file for description, and passes static configuration data into setuptools.setup(), with no external input or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, using setuptools. It reads the README file for a description, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and configures package metadata. All data sources are static or controlled, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. Usage of common tools like setuptools and Path indicates typical package setup behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It solely configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
