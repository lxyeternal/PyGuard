  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'djangorestframework_simplejwt', configuring dependencies, metadata, and reading the README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long_description; static dependency definitions; package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no external data handling beyond static file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.rst' into long_description; static dependencies and metadata assigned directly; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script following standard packaging practices. It reads a local README file, defines dependencies with version constraints, and sets package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or external data flows that could be malicious. All dependencies are static, and the file reading is safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess this, and no modifications are necessary.",
