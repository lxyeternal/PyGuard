  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is a standard JWT handler with no malicious intent, properly validating algorithms, managing keys, and handling encoding/decoding securely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no malicious features, only standard JWT handling with optional JWK support.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious logic, just external configuration potential via jwk_url.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis finds a standard JWT implementation with no malicious behavior, noting the optional JWK client as a standard feature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are suitable.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—standard, secure JWT handling with no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, no suspicious external interactions beyond typical JWK fetching.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** External JWK fetching is standard, no backdoors or malicious code.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern due to external dependencies/configuration, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented JWT backend module with no malicious or obfuscated features.**",
