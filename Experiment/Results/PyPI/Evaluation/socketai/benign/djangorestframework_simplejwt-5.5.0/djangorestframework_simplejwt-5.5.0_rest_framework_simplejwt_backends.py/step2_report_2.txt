  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, scoring consistency, and potential security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard JWT backend implementation. No malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The reliance on external libraries like jwt and optional jwks client is typical for such functionality.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the standard nature of the code.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious features. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusions are accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a standard JWT handler with proper validation, key management, and error handling. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are evident. The external jwks support is a common pattern.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scoring and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical JWT utility with proper validation, key handling, and external JWK support. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious features or malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard JWT handling with validation, optional JWK support, no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring and conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, the code is a standard JWT backend. External JWK fetching is a common feature, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm the code is standard JWT handling logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, justified by the absence of malicious features.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 are reasonable, reflecting standard operational risk for JWT implementations but not indicating any security compromise.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — standard operational risk, not indicative of vulnerabilities or sabotage.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-implemented JWT backend with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
