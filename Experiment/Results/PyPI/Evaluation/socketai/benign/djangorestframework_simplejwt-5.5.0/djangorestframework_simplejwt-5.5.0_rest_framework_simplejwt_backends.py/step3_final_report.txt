{
  "purpose": "This code implements a JWT backend handler for encoding and decoding tokens with support for multiple algorithms and optional JWKs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, configuration attributes (algorithm, keys, audience, issuer, jwk_url, leeway), and external dependencies (jwt, PyJWKClient).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs encoded tokens via jwt.encode; decodes tokens via jwt.decode; retrieves signing keys from internal properties or external jwks client; raises exceptions on invalid tokens.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (payload, token) flow into encode/decode functions; keys are prepared from internal properties or external jwks client; decoded tokens are validated against configured parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious external network activity beyond standard jwks fetching, which is configurable and common.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard JWT utility with proper validation of algorithms, key management, and error handling. It supports external JWKs, which is typical for dynamic key retrieval. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented JWT backend module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external dependencies and configuration points are standard and do not introduce malicious risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect a low security risk.",
