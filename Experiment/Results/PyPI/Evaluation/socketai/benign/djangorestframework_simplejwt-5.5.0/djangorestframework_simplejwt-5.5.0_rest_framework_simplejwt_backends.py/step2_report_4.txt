  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard JWT backend implementation. It validates algorithms, manages keys, and performs encoding/decoding with proper error handling. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected; the code appears safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical JWT handler with support for external JWKs. No signs of malicious activity. The external jwk_url is a configuration point, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard JWT implementation with key validation and optional JWK support. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. External jwk_url is a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious features.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar findings; secure JWT handling with proper validation, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard, secure JWT handling, optional external JWK fetching, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or maliciously exploitable features.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. All reports describe a typical JWT backend implementation.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.2), justified by external configuration points (e.g., jwk_url), which are standard but could be misused if misconfigured. However, this does not constitute malicious code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a legitimate, standard JWT utility implementation.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation features)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to external configuration points, which are standard but should be securely managed)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and follows best practices for JWT handling. No further action needed.",
