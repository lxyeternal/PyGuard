  "purpose": "The code implements a JWT authentication backend for Django REST Framework, handling token extraction, validation, and user retrieval.",
  "sources": "Request headers (META), token validation classes, user model, token claims.",
  "sinks": "User lookup, token validation, potential exception raising on invalid tokens.",
  "flows": "Header extraction -> token parsing -> token validation -> user retrieval -> validation checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of get_md5_hash_password for token revocation is standard if implemented securely.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured JWT authentication implementation. It correctly extracts the token from headers, validates it against multiple token classes, and retrieves the user with appropriate checks for activity and token revocation. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The use of get_md5_hash_password for token revocation is a common approach, assuming the utility is secure. The error handling and validation logic follow best practices. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and aligns with standard secure JWT handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure JWT authentication module with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior, indicating low malware and obfuscation risk, with a low overall security risk score of 0.2.",
