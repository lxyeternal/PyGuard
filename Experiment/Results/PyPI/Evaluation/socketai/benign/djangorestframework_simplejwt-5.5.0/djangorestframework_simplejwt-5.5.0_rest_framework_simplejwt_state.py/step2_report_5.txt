  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same pattern: importing configuration settings from `api_settings` and initializing a `TokenBackend` object.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, typical for setting up token management, and rely on external configuration for sensitive data.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard configuration practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code snippets are consistent and correctly implement a standard token backend initialization.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant errors are evident. The only potential concern is the handling of sensitive data (keys, URLs), but this is outside the scope of the code snippet itself.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. The obfuscated scores are 0, also appropriate. The security risk scores are low, reflecting typical configuration practices.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and does not introduce risks beyond standard configuration.\n\n- **Are the claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly state that the code is standard configuration without malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Potential security concern:** The use of sensitive parameters like `SIGNING_KEY`, `VERIFYING_KEY`, and `JWK_URL` from configuration is noted, but this is standard practice, assuming secure storage outside the codebase.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The code does not perform any network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard nature of the code and no malicious indicators, a score of **0.1–0.2** is appropriate.\n\n**Overall, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's actual content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, straightforward setup for token handling, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, assuming external configuration management is secure. The scores provided in the reports are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
