  "purpose": "Initialize a TokenBackend instance with configuration settings for token handling.",
  "sources": "api_settings module attributes: ALGORITHM, SIGNING_KEY, VERIFYING_KEY, AUDIENCE, ISSUER, JWK_URL, LEEWAY, JSON_ENCODER",
  "sinks": "TokenBackend constructor that may process or store these settings internally",
  "flows": "Reads configuration attributes from api_settings and passes them to TokenBackend",
  "anomalies": "Use of sensitive data like SIGNING_KEY and VERIFYING_KEY directly from configuration; no encryption or obfuscation evident. No explicit validation or sanitization shown, but this depends on the implementation of TokenBackend.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration settings and initializes a token handling object using those settings. The sensitive keys (SIGNING_KEY, VERIFYING_KEY) are loaded directly from a configuration source, which could pose a security risk if the configuration is compromised. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions, but the handling of secrets should be reviewed to ensure they are stored securely and managed properly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or unusual data flows. The code is straightforward, with no evident security flaws in this snippet but relies on external modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely initializes token handling settings using external configuration. There is no malicious behavior or suspicious activity within this snippet, though attention should be paid to how the configuration secrets are managed outside this code.",
