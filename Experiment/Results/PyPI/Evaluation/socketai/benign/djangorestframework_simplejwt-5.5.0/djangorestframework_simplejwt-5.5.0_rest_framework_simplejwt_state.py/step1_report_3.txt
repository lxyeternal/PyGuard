  "purpose": "Initialize a TokenBackend object with configuration settings for token handling, likely for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration values from api_settings (ALGORITHM, SIGNING_KEY, VERIFYING_KEY, AUDIENCE, ISSUER, JWK_URL, LEEWAY, JSON_ENCODER).",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no untrusted data being output or used in sensitive operations beyond configuration.",
  "flows": "Configuration values from api_settings are passed directly to the TokenBackend constructor, with no further processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "All configuration values appear to be read from a centralized settings module; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes and settings, then creates a TokenBackend instance with parameters sourced from a settings module. There is no dynamic code execution, no external input handling, and no suspicious or obfuscated code. The use of settings for keys and parameters is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for token handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical implementation of initializing a security-related component.",
