  "purpose": "Initialize a token backend with settings for token operations such as signing, verifying, and algorithms.",
  "sources": "api_settings attributes (ALGORITHM, SIGNING_KEY, VERIFYING_KEY, AUDIENCE, ISSUER, JWK_URL, LEEWAY, JSON_ENCODER)",
  "sinks": "TokenBackend constructor which processes the provided parameters for token management",
  "flows": "Values from api_settings are passed directly into TokenBackend constructor; these are used internally for token handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code simply initializes an object with configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration and backend classes, then creates an instance of TokenBackend with parameters sourced from api_settings. These parameters likely include cryptographic keys and token validation settings. The code appears to be straightforward configuration setup without any obfuscated or malicious logic. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The usage pattern is typical for token management setup in secure applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard configuration initialization for token handling, relying on external settings. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code appears safe and consistent with typical secure practices.",
