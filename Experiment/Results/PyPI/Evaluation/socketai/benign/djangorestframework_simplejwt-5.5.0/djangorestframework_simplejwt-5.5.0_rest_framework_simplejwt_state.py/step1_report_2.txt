  "purpose": "Initialize a TokenBackend instance with configuration settings for token handling.",
  "sources": "Importing modules, accessing api_settings attributes for configuration values.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; configuration data used for token processing.",
  "flows": "Configuration values from api_settings are passed directly into TokenBackend constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple sensitive configuration parameters such as signing keys and JWK URL; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, then creates an instance of TokenBackend using parameters from api_settings. The parameters include cryptographic keys and URLs, which are sensitive but sourced from a presumably secure configuration module. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears standard for setting up token handling in an authentication context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical setup for token management, utilizing external configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this snippet. The use of sensitive parameters warrants secure storage outside the code but is not inherently malicious.",
