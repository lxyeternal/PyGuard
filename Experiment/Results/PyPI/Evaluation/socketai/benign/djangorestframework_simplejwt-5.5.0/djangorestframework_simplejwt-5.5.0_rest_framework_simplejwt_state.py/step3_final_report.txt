  "purpose": "Initialization of a token backend with configuration parameters sourced from external settings for token management.",
  "sources": "api_settings module providing ALGORITHM, SIGNING_KEY, VERIFYING_KEY, AUDIENCE, ISSUER, JWK_URL, LEEWAY, JSON_ENCODER",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly used in a vulnerable manner within this code snippet",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow from api_settings into TokenBackend constructor; no data flows to external systems or network",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for token setup, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration parameters and initializes a TokenBackend object with these parameters. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution. The parameters are sourced externally, which is standard practice. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The code's purpose is purely configuration, and proper secret management outside this code is assumed. No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration snippet for token management, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is low, and the scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
