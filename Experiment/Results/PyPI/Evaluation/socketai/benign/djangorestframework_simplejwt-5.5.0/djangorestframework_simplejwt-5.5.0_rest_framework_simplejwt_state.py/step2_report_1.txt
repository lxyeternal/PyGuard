  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward configuration.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is low (0.2). The confidence is high (0.9). These seem reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk score?** The low risk score is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Malware score?** Correctly 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Claims based on assumptions?** No; the report is cautious and based on observed code.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent findings.\n- **Scores:** Same reasoning applies; scores are appropriate.\n- **Malware?** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk?** Low, as expected.\n- **Conclusion?** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Malware?** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk?** Low.\n- **Conclusion?** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slight note on handling secrets:\n  - The code loads sensitive keys directly from configuration.\n  - While this isn't malicious, it emphasizes secure storage outside code.\n- **Scores:** Still appropriate; no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Malware?** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk?** Slightly higher (0.2) but justified given the sensitive data handling.\n- **Conclusion?** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as previous; standard setup.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Malware?** 0.\n- **Risk?** Low.\n- **Conclusion?** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Are the reported issues present?** No, all reports confirm the code is straightforward configuration.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?** None. The reports correctly identify the code as standard setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores adjustment?** The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?** No, all are appropriately low.\n- **Malware scores?** Correctly 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Claims based on assumptions?** No; the reports are cautious and based on observed code.\n- **Score consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard configuration with sensitive data handling, but no evident security flaw)\n\n**Note:** The code is a typical setup for token management, relying on external configuration. Proper secret management outside this code is essential but not part of this snippet.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the security risk remains low.",
