  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured TSV utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low security risk score (around 0.1 to 0.2) assigned in the reports is appropriate, considering the minimal potential for misuse. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the code is safe for use in supply chain contexts, with no security concerns."
