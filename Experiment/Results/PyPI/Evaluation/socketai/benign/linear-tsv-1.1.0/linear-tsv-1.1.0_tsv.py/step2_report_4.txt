  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward TSV parser and formatter.\n- It handles escape sequences, line consistency, and supports namedtuples and dictionaries.\n- No network activity, external calls, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code uses standard Python libraries and patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Benign TSV utility, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious intent, standard TSV processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard TSV utility, no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Analysis of securityRisk=0.2:**  \nWhile the code is benign, the report assigns a small security risk (0.2). Given the code's nature—pure data parsing and formatting with no external interactions—this seems slightly overcautious. However, since the code handles escape sequences and could potentially be used maliciously if misused (e.g., if input is untrusted and maliciously crafted), a small risk score is justifiable, especially in a supply chain context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate. The low security risk score reflects the minimal potential for harm in untrusted environments, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—standard TSV processing, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. Slightly lower risk score, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting cautious assessment of potential misuse, which is reasonable given the code's function.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are accurate.\n- The low security risk scores are justified considering the code's purpose and lack of malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (a very conservative, cautious estimate considering potential misuse, but the code itself is safe)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is a benign, standard TSV utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
