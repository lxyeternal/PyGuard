  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'linear-tsv', used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and dependency specifications; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or transmitted based on this script.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script only defines static data and does not process runtime input or output data flows.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; the script adheres to standard setuptools usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python package distribution. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed metadata, including package info, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not read external input, perform network operations, or contain any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
