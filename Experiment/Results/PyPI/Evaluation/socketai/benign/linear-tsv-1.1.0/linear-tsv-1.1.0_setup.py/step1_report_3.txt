{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'linear-tsv' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, such as name, license, version, description, author details, URL, modules, requirements, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present; the code does not write to files, network, or interact with environment variables dynamically.",
  "flows": "Since all data is statically defined, there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. The setup script appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to specify package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner. There are no functions, loops, or dynamic code execution. It does not include any external or untrusted input handling. All data is hardcoded, and no network or environment interaction occurs. The structure aligns with common Python package setup scripts. No signs of malicious intent or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup configuration script for a Python package. It does not contain malware or security risks. The package appears safe to use and distribute.",
