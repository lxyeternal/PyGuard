  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'linear-tsv' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data such as package name, license, version, description, author info, URL, module list, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user input handling present; no potential data leaks or effect-inducing operations.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static configuration data, with no dynamic input or data flow from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "This script employs setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It contains only static configuration data and standard setup parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. It appears to be a straightforward, benign setup configuration with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling features.",
