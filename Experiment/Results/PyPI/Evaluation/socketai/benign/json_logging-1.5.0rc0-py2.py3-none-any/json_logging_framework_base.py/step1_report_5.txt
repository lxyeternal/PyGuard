{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for request/response extraction, framework configuration, and request instrumentation configuration in a web application context.",
  "sources": "No data sources or inputs are explicitly read; classes only define interfaces and placeholders for implementation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present; no handling of untrusted data occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no executable flows or data transfer paths; code contains only class definitions and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely abstract, with no implementation details, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple singleton-like abstract classes intended for request/response data extraction and framework configuration. All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are placeholders for concrete implementations elsewhere. There are no data processing, data transfer, or execution flows, and no input/output handling within this code segment. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected. The design promotes modular, framework-agnostic extension without embedding executable or harmful logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structural foundation for a logging or instrumentation system in a web framework. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or potentially malicious components. Overall security risk is negligible, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
