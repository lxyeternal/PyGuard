{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes for request/response info extraction, configuration, and instrumentation within a web framework, serving as interfaces for extension.",
  "sources": "Method signatures that accept request or response objects; no actual data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; potential data flow depends on subclass implementations.",
  "flows": "No concrete data flows; only method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of singleton pattern via __new__, which is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract base classes with method signatures raising NotImplementedError, serving as interfaces for framework extension. No executable logic, data processing, network activity, or data leaks are present. The singleton pattern is used in a conventional manner. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified given the purely abstract nature; the actual risk is minimal. The malware score of 0 is appropriate, as there is no malicious code or behavior. The obfuscated score of 0 is justified, as the code is straightforward and readable. The risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting that actual security concerns depend on subclass implementations, not this interface code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of abstract classes intended for extension in a web framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in its current form. The high risk scores assigned in some reports are not justified by the code's nature. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
