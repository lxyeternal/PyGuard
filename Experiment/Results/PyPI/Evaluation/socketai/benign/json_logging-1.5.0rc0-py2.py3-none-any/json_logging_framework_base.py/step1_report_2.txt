{
  "purpose": "The code provides abstract base classes for extracting request and response info, framework configuration, and request instrumentation setup for web frameworks.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; it defines class interfaces and static methods for request/response data extraction.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines interfaces with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The classes contain only method signatures with NotImplementedError, indicating they are intended as interfaces or abstract classes. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines abstract base classes with methods to be implemented in subclasses for request/response handling, configuration, and instrumentation. There is no actual logic or data processing, reducing the likelihood of malicious behavior. The pattern is consistent with design for modular, framework-agnostic request handling. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. It appears to be a standard, minimal framework interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of abstract base classes defining interfaces for request/response extraction, framework configuration, and instrumentation. It does not contain executable logic, data leaks, or malicious code. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malware. The code seems safe and intended for extension.",
