  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of abstract classes intended for extension in a web framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in its current form. The high risk scores assigned in some reports are not justified by the code's nature. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its purpose."
