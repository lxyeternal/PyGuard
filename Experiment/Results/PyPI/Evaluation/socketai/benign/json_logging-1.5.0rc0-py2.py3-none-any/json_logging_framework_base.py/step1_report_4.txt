  "purpose": "This code provides abstract base classes for extracting request and response information, configuring logging, and request instrumentation in a web framework-agnostic manner.",
  "sources": "Request objects in methods like get_http_header, get_remote_user, get_correlation_id_in_request_context, get_protocol, get_path, get_content_length, get_method, get_remote_ip, get_remote_port; Response objects in methods like get_status_code, get_response_size, get_content_type.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be accessed and potentially logged or used for further processing if derived classes implement these methods with insecure logic.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request and response objects through abstract methods to logging or other handling code; however, the provided code only defines interfaces without implementation, so actual data flows depend on subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is purely abstract and designed for extension. The singleton pattern via __new__ is consistent with design patterns but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple abstract base classes for extracting information from HTTP request and response objects, configuring logging, and request instrumentation. No executable logic or data handling is present, and no external input processing occurs within this code snippet. The singleton pattern is used to enforce a single instance for configuration classes. All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating that actual implementations should be provided elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to serve as a structured interface for extending framework-specific functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a set of abstract interfaces for request/response data extraction and logging configuration in web frameworks. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or malware evident. It is a well-structured foundation for further extension, with no immediate security risks identified.",
