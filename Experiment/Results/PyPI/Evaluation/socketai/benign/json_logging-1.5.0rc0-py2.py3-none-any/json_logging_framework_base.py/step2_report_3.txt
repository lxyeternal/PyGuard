  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines abstract classes with no implementation. No data input, external communication, or logic. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 (high).  \n  The high risk score seems unreasonable given the purely abstract nature. Since no concrete implementation exists, the potential for malicious activity is minimal. The high risk appears to be an overestimate.\n- **Justification:** Without implementation, these classes cannot execute malicious actions. The singleton pattern is standard. No data leaks or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—abstract classes with no implementation, standard singleton pattern, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  The low risk score aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity possible here.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely interface definitions, so the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—interfaces with no implementation, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  Slightly higher than Report 2, but still reasonable given the abstract nature.\n- **Justification:** No concrete logic or data handling, so the risk remains low.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Abstract classes with potential data flow in subclasses, but no actual implementation here. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  Slightly higher, but still consistent with the abstract, non-executable nature.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Purely structural, no data or logic, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Completely aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no concrete implementation or behavior indicating malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** The high risk scores in Reports 1 and 2 are inconsistent with the code's nature. Given these are interface definitions with no implementation, the potential for security issues is negligible. A more appropriate risk score would be around 0.1 to 0.2 for all reports, reflecting minimal inherent risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely abstract, defining interfaces for request/response handling and framework configuration.\n- No data flows, no execution, no external input processing, no network activity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The singleton pattern used is standard and not suspicious.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 for all reports, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to the interface nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of abstract classes intended for extension. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. The high risk scores assigned in some reports are unjustified given the context.",
