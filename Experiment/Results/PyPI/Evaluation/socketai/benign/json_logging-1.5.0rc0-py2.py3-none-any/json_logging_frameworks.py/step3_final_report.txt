  "purpose": "Register support for various web frameworks in a logging utility, ensuring proper class validation and support mapping.",
  "sources": "Class parameters for request/response extractors, app configurators, and app request instrumentation configurators.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, external data processing, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Validation functions verify class inheritance; support map is updated with validated classes; optional logging on re-registration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward registration process.",
  "analysis": "The code performs framework support registration with class validation, support map updates, and optional debug logging. It imports known modules, validates class inheritance, and registers support classes into a global map. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or network activity are evident. The process is standard plugin registration, with validation ensuring class correctness. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard registration mechanism for framework support with validation. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and has a very low security risk profile. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
