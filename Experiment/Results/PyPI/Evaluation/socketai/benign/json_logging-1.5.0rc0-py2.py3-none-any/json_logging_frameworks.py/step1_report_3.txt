{
  "purpose": "This code registers support for various web frameworks with a logging library, configuring request and response extractors and app configurators.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, imported modules, framework-specific class references, and the 'register_framework_support' function calls.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that execute untrusted input or perform data leaks. No network connections, file writes, or eval-like functions are present.",
  "flows": "Framework registration functions pass class references and configuration parameters to a central registry without executing or transforming untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow detected. Use of 'import' statements and function calls appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports framework support modules and registers support for Flask, Sanic, Quart, Connexion, and FastAPI. The 'register_framework_support' function validates class types and updates a support map. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data manipulation is observed. The code appears to be well-structured and typical for a plugin registration mechanism without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin registration setup for a logging library to support multiple web frameworks. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. All operations involve class registration and validation without executing untrusted data or performing harmful actions.",
