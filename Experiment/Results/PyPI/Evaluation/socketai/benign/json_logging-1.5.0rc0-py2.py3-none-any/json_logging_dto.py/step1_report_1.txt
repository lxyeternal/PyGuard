  "purpose": "Defines data transfer objects (DTOs) for request instrumentation logging, capturing request and response timing details.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'request' and 'response' objects passed into class methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'util.iso_time_format' function for timestamp formatting; no other data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Request object is stored during initialization; response data is stored during 'on_request_complete'; timestamps are generated and formatted for logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data handling, or unusual code patterns detected. No external network calls, file manipulations, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages timing and request/response data. It employs standard Python modules and a utility for timestamp formatting. No suspicious input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior identified. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for logging request timing details. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
