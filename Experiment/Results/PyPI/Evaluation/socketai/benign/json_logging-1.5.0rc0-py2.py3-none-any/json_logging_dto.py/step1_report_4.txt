{
  "purpose": "Defines data transfer objects (DTOs) for request instrumentation logging, capturing request and response metadata.",
  "sources": "request object passed during initialization, response object passed to on_request_complete method, datetime.utcnow() calls, util.iso_time_format function.",
  "sinks": "util.iso_time_format calls could process data, but without implementation details, no direct sink identified.",
  "flows": "request -> initialization, response -> on_request_complete method, datetime.utcnow() -> timestamp variables, util.iso_time_format -> formatted timestamps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. No external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements DTO classes for logging request and response timing information. It uses standard datetime functions and a utility for formatting ISO timestamps. No user input handling or external data processing that could be malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of request/response logging objects with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
