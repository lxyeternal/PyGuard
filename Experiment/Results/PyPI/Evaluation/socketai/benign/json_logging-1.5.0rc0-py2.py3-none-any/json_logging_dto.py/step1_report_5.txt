{
  "purpose": "Defines data transfer objects (DTOs) for logging request and response information, including timestamps.",
  "sources": "Request object passed during instantiation, system datetime for timestamps, util.iso_time_format for formatting timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of request/response data if logged or transmitted insecurely, use of datetime and formatting functions are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Request data -> timestamp generation -> formatting -> storing in object properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code relies on standard library and a logging utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines DTO classes for request/response logging, capturing timestamps and formatting them. It uses standard modules (datetime, external util). No input sanitization or network operations are present. No signs of data leakage, malicious code, or sabotage. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward logging logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility for request timing, with no malicious intent or security risks observed. It does not contain malware or suspicious activity.",
