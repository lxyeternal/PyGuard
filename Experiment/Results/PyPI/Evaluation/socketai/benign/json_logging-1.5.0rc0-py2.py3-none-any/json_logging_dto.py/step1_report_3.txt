  "purpose": "Define data transfer objects (DTOs) for request and response logging, capturing timing and request data.",
  "sources": "request object in constructor, datetime.utcnow() calls, util.iso_time_format() function calls",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or external calls beyond data formatting functions",
  "flows": "request object is stored; datetime.utcnow() outputs are used to compute timing, and util.iso_time_format() formats datetime objects",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of datetime and formatting functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines DTO classes for logging request/response data, capturing timestamps using datetime.utcnow() and formatting with util.iso_time_format(). There are no external network operations, file writes, or sensitive data leaks. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility for web requests, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
