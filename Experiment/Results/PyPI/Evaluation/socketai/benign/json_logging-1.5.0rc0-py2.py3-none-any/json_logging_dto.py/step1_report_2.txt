  "purpose": "Define data transfer objects (DTOs) for request instrumentation logging, capturing request and response timing information.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'request' object passed to class constructors, and internal calls to 'util.iso_time_format' with datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable sink is 'util.iso_time_format' if it processes untrusted data improperly, but likely it only formats datetime objects. No other untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Request object flows into class constructors; 'datetime.utcnow()' outputs are formatted into ISO strings via 'util.iso_time_format'. Response data is added during 'on_request_complete' method, with timing calculations based on internal datetime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. Usage of datetime and dictionary extension is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines DTO classes for logging request and response data, using 'datetime.utcnow()' to timestamp request receipt and response sent times, formatted via 'util.iso_time_format'. The classes are standard and do not perform any data manipulation or network operations. No untrusted data is processed in a dangerous way. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for logging purposes, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It securely captures timing information for requests and responses without evident security risks.",
