  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign request instrumentation module for Quart with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero. The risk score of 0.2 is justified due to broad exception handling and potential log data exposure, but these are common trade-offs in such instrumentation code."
