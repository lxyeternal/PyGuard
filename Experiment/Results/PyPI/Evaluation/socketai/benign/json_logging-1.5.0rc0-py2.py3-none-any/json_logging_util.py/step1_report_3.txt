  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), request objects (via get_request_from_call_stack), and logger configurations.",
  "sinks": "Logger handlers, request header access, environment variable usage, and potential data outputs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Logging setup -> Request object retrieval -> Correlation ID management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utilities for logging, environment variable toggles, request handling, and time formatting. It validates subclasses and manages singleton request objects, extracting correlation IDs from request headers or generating new ones. It employs standard libraries and practices without unusual code constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on standard patterns for secure request and logging management, with no suspicious external communication or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for logging and request processing, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows common coding standards and best practices without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
