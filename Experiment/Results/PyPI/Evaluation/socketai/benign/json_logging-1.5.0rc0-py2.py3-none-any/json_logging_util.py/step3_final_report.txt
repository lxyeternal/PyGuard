  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging, environment variable toggles, request context extraction, and time formatting in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), request objects (via inspect and call stack), logging handlers, and external correlation ID generator.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not write untrusted data to network, files, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence toggles; request objects are retrieved from call stack; correlation IDs are generated or retrieved from request headers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys._getframe for call stack inspection is standard but can be sensitive if request objects are maliciously crafted; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for logging setup, environment variable interpretation, request context extraction, and time formatting. No hardcoded secrets, network communication, or malicious patterns are present. The use of call stack inspection and singleton pattern for request info extraction is typical in such utilities. The correlation ID generation relies on external configurable generators, which is standard practice. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for logging and request context management. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security threats. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.",
