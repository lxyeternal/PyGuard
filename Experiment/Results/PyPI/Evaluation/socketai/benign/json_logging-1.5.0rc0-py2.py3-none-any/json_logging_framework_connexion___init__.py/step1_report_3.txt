{
  "purpose": "The code configures request logging and information extraction for a web application using the connexion framework with Flask, including request lifecycle hooks and context handling.",
  "sources": "Reads data from request objects (_current_request), environment variables (request.environ), and request headers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes request data in logs, accesses environment variables, and modifies Flask's g object for context.",
  "flows": "Request data flows from _current_request and request.environ to logging, context setting, and response extraction methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports connexion and flask, uses broad exception handling without specific error logging, and assigns to flask.g without validation. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. No malicious payloads or covert channels present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to set up logging and request information extraction for a web app built with connexion and Flask. It includes functions to detect and import dependencies, configures request lifecycle hooks, and extracts request/response data. Exception handling is broad but doesn't indicate malicious intent. Data flows are standard for request processing. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is focused on logging and context management, consistent with legitimate monitoring activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical request logging and info extraction setup for a Flask/connexion app, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It appears safe and legitimate.",
