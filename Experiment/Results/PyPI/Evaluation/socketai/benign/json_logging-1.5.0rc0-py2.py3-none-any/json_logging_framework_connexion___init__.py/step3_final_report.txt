{
  "purpose": "Provides request and response instrumentation for a Flask/Connexion web application, enabling detailed logging and metadata extraction for requests.",
  "sources": "Request object attributes (path, method, headers, environment variables), global context g, environment variables, request headers, request environment.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions, setting attributes in global context g, request response data handling.",
  "flows": "Request data is read from the request object, stored in g or request_response_data, and then logged or processed after request completion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling that could mask errors; dynamic imports; no obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard instrumentation tasks: it checks for the presence of the 'connexion' module, sets up request logging before and after requests, extracts request metadata, and logs request/response data. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical logging practices in web frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate request/response instrumentation module for a Flask/Connexion application. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The primary concern is potential privacy issues if sensitive data is logged, but this is a configuration matter rather than a security flaw. The overall security risk is low.",
