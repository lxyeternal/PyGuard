  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the observed behavior.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The core code is a straightforward dependency check: attempting to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette' within a try-except block.\n- If successful, it conditionally imports internal modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.\n- The broad exception handling (except:) suppresses all errors, which could hide underlying issues, but does not inherently indicate malicious activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The import pattern is typical for optional dependencies in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify the core logic: dependency detection via import attempts and conditional imports.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The main concern is the broad exception handling which can hide import errors, but this is a common pattern for optional dependencies, not necessarily a flaw. No malicious or suspicious code is detected.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  - Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n  - Security risks are low, reflecting the benign dependency check.\n  - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n  - Confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), appropriate given the clear, simple logic.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:**  \n  Correctly set to 0; code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk scores:**  \n  Slightly above 0.1 in some reports, but given the broad exception handling, a small risk score (e.g., 0.2) is acceptable. No evidence suggests higher risk.\n\n- **Potential for malicious activity:**  \n  None is evident; the code is a standard dependency check.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n- **Broad exception handling:**  \n  While not malicious, it could be refined to catch specific import errors, but this is a minor concern.\n\n- **Additional considerations:**  \n  Since the conditional import occurs only if the dependencies are present, and no suspicious behavior is detected, the overall security posture remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.2** (average across reports, acceptable) |\n\n**Overall:** The code is a benign environment check for optional FastAPI support, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward dependency check with conditional imports. The scores are reasonable and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary based on the provided information.",
