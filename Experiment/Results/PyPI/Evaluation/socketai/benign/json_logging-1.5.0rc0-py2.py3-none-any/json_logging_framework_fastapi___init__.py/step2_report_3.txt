  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a function that attempts to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette' within a try-except block.\n- If successful, they conditionally import internal modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.\n- The broad exception handling is noted as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code are identified.\n- The overall logic appears to be a standard dependency check for optional features.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; matches the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; conditional import based on detection.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad except block suppresses all exceptions, which could hide issues, but no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies benign behavior; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (minor concern about broad exception handling)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is a straightforward dependency check with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (low, aligns with the benign nature)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign dependency detection.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still low; acceptable)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes this is a standard dependency check with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (no risk)  \n  - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies benign conditional import pattern.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (low, acceptable)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are acceptable, reflecting minor concerns about broad exception handling but nothing serious.\n\n**Final Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to broad exception handling but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. No adjustments are necessary. The code is a typical dependency detection pattern with minimal security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the broad exception handling could be improved for robustness, it does not constitute a security risk or malicious activity. The overall security posture remains benign.",
