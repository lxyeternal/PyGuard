  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, reasoning, and scores to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Checks for FastAPI presence and imports related modules.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the function attempts to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette' to determine if FastAPI is installed. The broad exception handling is noted as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The broad exception could hide issues but isn't malicious. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard dependency check.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Identical to previous reports; no suspicious activity or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the dependency check and conditional import pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence and zero risk score are justified, given the straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, standard dependency check, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in the code or reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, mostly low, justified by the broad exception handling which could hide errors but isn't malicious.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (0.9 to 1), justified given the straightforward dependency check pattern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- The only minor concern is the broad exception handling, which could hide issues but doesn't introduce malicious behavior.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, due to broad exception handling but not malicious)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 to 1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code and reports indicate a benign dependency check pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate.",
