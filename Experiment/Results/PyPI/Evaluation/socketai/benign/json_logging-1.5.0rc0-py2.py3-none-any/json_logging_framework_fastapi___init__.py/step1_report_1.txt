  "purpose": "Check for presence of FastAPI framework and import related modules if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements within the is_fastapi_present() function, and conditional import of local modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential import of local modules, which could be malicious if the module path is compromised or altered.",
  "flows": "The function attempts to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette'. If successful, it proceeds to import specific local modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.",
  "anomalies": "The try-except block suppresses all exceptions, which could hide import errors or malicious module hijacking. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that checks if the 'fastapi' package is installed by attempting to import it along with 'starlette'. It returns True if successful, False otherwise. If FastAPI is present, it conditionally imports local modules related to instrumentation. The broad exception handling may hide underlying issues or malicious modifications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a straightforward feature detection and conditional import pattern typical for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign feature check for FastAPI presence and conditional import of related modules. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.",
