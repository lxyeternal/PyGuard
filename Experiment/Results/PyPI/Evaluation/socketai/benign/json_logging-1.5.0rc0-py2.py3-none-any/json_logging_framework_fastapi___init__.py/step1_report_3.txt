  "purpose": "Check for presence of the FastAPI framework and conditionally import related modules",
  "sources": "Attempted import of 'fastapi' and 'starlette' within a try-except block",
  "sinks": "Conditional import statement of internal modules (.implementation), which may be used later in the application",
  "flows": "is_fastapi_present() function determines whether to import specific internal modules based on the presence of FastAPI",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad except clause that suppresses all exceptions; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to detect if the 'fastapi' and 'starlette' packages are installed. If so, it imports internal modules relevant to FastAPI request instrumentation. The broad exception handling suppresses any import errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The conditional import pattern is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a feature detection mechanism to conditionally load modules related to FastAPI. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.",
