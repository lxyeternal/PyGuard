  "purpose": "The code dynamically checks for the presence of the 'fastapi' package and conditionally imports specific modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements within the function 'is_fastapi_present' that attempt to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette'.",
  "sinks": "The conditional import of modules from the current package based on the presence of 'fastapi', which could influence subsequent runtime behavior.",
  "flows": "The function 'is_fastapi_present' detects if 'fastapi' and 'starlette' are available. If so, it triggers the import of instrumentation modules related to FastAPI. The flow is from the import attempt to the conditional import based on the result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code performs a standard dependency check and conditional import. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to check for the presence of 'fastapi' by attempting imports within a try-except block. If the import succeeds, it returns True; otherwise, False. If True, it proceeds to import several modules from the current package, likely for instrumentation purposes. The logic is straightforward and typical for optional dependencies. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious activity, or security risks. The imports and conditional logic are standard for Python projects that support optional features based on available dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign dependency check and conditional import to support optional FastAPI instrumentation. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
