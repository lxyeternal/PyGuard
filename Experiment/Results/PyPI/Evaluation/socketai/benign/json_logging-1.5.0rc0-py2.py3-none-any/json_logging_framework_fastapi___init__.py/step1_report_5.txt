  "purpose": "Check for the presence of the FastAPI framework and conditionally import related modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement within the if block that is executed if FastAPI is present.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the import of modules 'FastAPIAppRequestInstrumentationConfigurator', 'FastAPIRequestInfoExtractor', and 'FastAPIResponseInfoExtractor' if executed.",
  "flows": "The function checks for 'fastapi' and 'starlette' modules; if present, imports specific internal modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated behavior observed. The code is straightforward and standard for optional module import based on availability.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that attempts to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette' modules, returning True if successful, False otherwise. If the modules are present, it imports three internal modules related to FastAPI instrumentation. The import is conditional and based on the environment's installed packages, with no apparent malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or hidden behaviors. It appears to be a typical environment check and conditional import pattern used in modular codebases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple environment check for FastAPI presence and conditionally imports related modules. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code is standard and safe.",
