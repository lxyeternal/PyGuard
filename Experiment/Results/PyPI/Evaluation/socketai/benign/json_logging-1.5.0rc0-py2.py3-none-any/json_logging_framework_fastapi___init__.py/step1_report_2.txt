{
  "purpose": "Checks for the presence of the FastAPI library and conditionally imports specific modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements within the function 'is_fastapi_present()' that attempt to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette'.",
  "sinks": "Conditional import of local modules 'FastAPIAppRequestInstrumentationConfigurator', 'FastAPIRequestInfoExtractor', 'FastAPIResponseInfoExtractor' if FastAPI is present.",
  "flows": "The function attempts to import external libraries; if successful, it proceeds to import internal modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The import logic is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to check for the presence of the 'fastapi' package by attempting to import it and 'starlette'. If the import succeeds, it returns True; otherwise, False. Based on this check, it conditionally imports modules related to FastAPI instrumentation. The approach is simple and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. It appears to be part of a larger system that instruments or monitors FastAPI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a runtime check for FastAPI presence and conditionally importing instrumentation modules. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data flow.",
