  "purpose": "Detects if 'fastapi' and 'starlette' modules are installed by attempting to import them, enabling conditional import of related instrumentation modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements within the try block for 'fastapi' and 'starlette'.",
  "sinks": "Conditional import of internal modules if dependencies are present; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import dependencies; if successful, proceed to import internal modules related to FastAPI instrumentation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (except:) which suppresses all errors, potentially hiding import issues but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward optional dependency check by attempting to import 'fastapi' and 'starlette'. The broad exception handling, while not best practice, is common for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. All reports correctly interpret this as a benign environment check. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minor concerns about exception handling but no actual security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard optional dependency detection pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate and scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
