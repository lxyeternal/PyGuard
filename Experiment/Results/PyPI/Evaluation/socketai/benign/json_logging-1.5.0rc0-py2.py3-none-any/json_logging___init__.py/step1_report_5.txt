{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures JSON-based logging support for various web frameworks and non-web applications, with utilities for correlation ID management and logger setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment variable checks, function parameters, global variables, and method arguments such as 'framework_name', 'custom_formatter', 'enable_json'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include JSON serialization via json.dumps, setting log formatters, and output to sys.stdout, but these are standard practices for logging.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or function arguments flows through configuration functions to set up formatters, request utilities, and logger handlers, primarily affecting logging output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of environment variables for toggles is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically sets up JSON logging for supported frameworks and non-web contexts, handling configuration, formatter setup, and logger adjustments. It uses standard libraries, environment variables, and method calls to manage logging behavior. No malicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be a legitimate logging utility with proper structure, without signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging configuration module intended for setting up structured JSON logging across different frameworks and contexts. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. All observed patterns are consistent with standard logging practices.",
