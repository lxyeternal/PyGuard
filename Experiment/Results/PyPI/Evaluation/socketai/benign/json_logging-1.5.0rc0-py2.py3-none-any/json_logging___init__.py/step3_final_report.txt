{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive setup for JSON logging in Python applications, supporting multiple frameworks and non-web contexts, with environment variable toggles, correlation ID management, and customizable formatters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., ENABLE_JSON_LOGGING), request objects, function parameters, and standard libraries (json, uuid, logging).",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers, primarily stdout or existing loggers, producing JSON-formatted logs.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions read environment variables and request data; loggers output formatted logs via handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected. Use of uuid.uuid1() for correlation IDs is predictable but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging configuration module supporting multiple frameworks, with environment variable toggles and correlation ID support. It uses common libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of uuid.uuid1() for IDs is predictable but typical for correlation purposes. No external data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and purpose align with legitimate logging setup, and the absence of suspicious patterns indicates low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2 are justified and appropriate given the context.",
