  "purpose": "Retrieve the active cloud configuration for Azure CLI, with considerations for deprecated API versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'azure.cli.core.cloud' module, and the 'try-except' block handling ImportError.",
  "sinks": "The 'return get_active_cloud()' call, which depends on the imported function, but not directly untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from 'azure.cli.core.cloud', followed by returning the result of 'get_active_cloud()' if import succeeds.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code includes deprecation notices and exception handling but no suspicious or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'get_active_cloud' from 'azure.cli.core.cloud' and calls it. If the import fails, it raises an ImportError with a detailed message. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors present. The exception handling is standard, and the function serves as a wrapper to access a potentially external API. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are detected. The code relies on external modules, which is common in CLI tools, and there are no data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward wrapper for a deprecated Azure CLI API function, with proper exception handling. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
