  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code to assess the presence of issues, malicious activity, or anomalies.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code attempts to import `get_active_cloud` from `azure.cli.core.cloud`.\n- If the import fails (e.g., module not installed or outdated), it raises an ImportError with a detailed message.\n- If successful, it returns the result of `get_active_cloud()`.\n- The code includes deprecation warnings and version notices, but no suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious code are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all conclude similarly:\n- The purpose is to retrieve Azure CLI cloud configuration.\n- The sources are the import statement and the function call.\n- The sinks are the return value or exception.\n- The flows are straightforward: import -> call -> return or error.\n- No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is deemed safe, well-documented, and standard.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Proper exception handling for missing dependencies.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or untrusted input.\n- The deprecation warning and detailed error message are standard for SDK version management, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking with the Code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is simple and performs a standard import with error handling. No issues are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The code does not perform any network calls, execute untrusted code, or contain hidden logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Zero. The code is a utility wrapper around a known SDK function.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nEven though the code handles deprecated API versions, this is a standard practice and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nBased on the reports and the code, **the overall scores should be:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0**\n\nThe code is benign, standard SDK interaction, with no indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, well-behaved, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports align with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or indirect malicious behaviors in dependencies, but based on this static review, the code is safe.",
