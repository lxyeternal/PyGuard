{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the active cloud configuration from the Azure CLI environment, with deprecation warning handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'get_active_cloud' from 'azure.cli.core.cloud'. The code also reads the module's exception handling when ImportError occurs.",
  "sinks": "Return statement calling 'get_active_cloud'. No data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Import 'get_active_cloud' -> return 'get_active_cloud()' invocation. No untrusted data flows to external systems or causes side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecation warning and a version check, but no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a function from an Azure SDK module, handling ImportError to provide an informative message if the module is missing or outdated. It simply returns the result of 'get_active_cloud()'. No external data is received from untrusted sources, no data is leaked, and there are no suspicious code behaviors. The exception message warns about potential data corruption if used improperly with incompatible versions, but this is documentation rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility function for interacting with the Azure CLI SDK. It performs no malicious actions, data leakage, or supply chain attacks. The code appears safe and well-behaved.",
