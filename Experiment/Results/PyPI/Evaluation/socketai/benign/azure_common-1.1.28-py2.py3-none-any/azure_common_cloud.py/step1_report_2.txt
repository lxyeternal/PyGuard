  "flows": "Import azure.cli.core.cloud, then invoke get_active_cloud() to obtain cloud data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; proper exception handling for missing import.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import get_active_cloud from azure.cli.core.cloud, then calls it to return the active cloud configuration. It includes a try-except block to handle ImportError, providing a detailed error message if the import fails. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It is designed to interact with a known, legitimate SDK module, with documented deprecation notices and version warnings. The code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations, nor does it contain hidden backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-documented function to access a specific SDK feature. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The function relies on a standard import and a straightforward function call, with proper error handling. It appears to be a legitimate utility function for Azure CLI integration.",
