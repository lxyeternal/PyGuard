  "purpose": "Retrieve the currently active Azure CLI cloud configuration if available.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from azure.cli.core.cloud import get_active_cloud'; potential exception handling for ImportError.",
  "sinks": "Return statement calling 'get_active_cloud()'; exception raising with detailed message.",
  "flows": "Import attempt → exception handling → either successful call to 'get_active_cloud()' or raising an informative error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the import is conditional and properly handled; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a function from a potentially external Azure CLI package. If the package is unavailable, it raises a detailed ImportError warning about deprecation and potential data corruption. The primary function is to return a cloud configuration object if possible. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The function is straightforward, with proper error handling, and does not perform any external network calls or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It merely handles the import and usage of a specific Azure CLI function with appropriate error handling. No malware or security concerns are evident.",
