  "purpose": "Retrieve the currently active cloud configuration for the Azure CLI.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'get_active_cloud' from 'azure.cli.core.cloud', and the ImportError handling.",
  "sinks": "Return value from 'get_active_cloud()'; exception raising for ImportError.",
  "flows": "Import statement -> function call to 'get_active_cloud' -> return value or exception.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecated API warnings and explicit error handling for missing dependencies; no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to import and call an Azure CLI SDK function to get the current cloud configuration. The import is wrapped in a try-except block to handle ImportError, providing a detailed error message if the dependency is missing or outdated. No input data from external sources is processed; the only external dependency is the 'azure.cli.core.cloud' module. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or execute untrusted code. The deprecation warning and explicit error message indicate awareness of SDK versioning but do not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function for retrieving cloud configuration information from the Azure SDK, with proper error handling and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
