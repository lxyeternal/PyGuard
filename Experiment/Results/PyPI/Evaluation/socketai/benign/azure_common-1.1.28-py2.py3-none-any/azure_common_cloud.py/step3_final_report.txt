  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and function call with error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility function that imports a specific SDK function, with proper exception handling for missing modules. It includes documentation and deprecation notices but no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or contain obfuscation. All signals indicate benign, standard SDK usage. The error handling is appropriate, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented utility function with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and very low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
