  "purpose": "This code provides a mixin class for managing multi-API version profiles in a client application, handling user inputs and profile validation.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters 'api_version' and 'profile', class attributes 'LATEST_PROFILE' and '_PROFILE_TAG', and profile definitions.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval of API version information from profile dictionaries, no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into profile setup, which is then used by '_get_api_version' to access profile dictionaries and return version info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. Error handling is standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward profile management mixin with validation of class attributes and user inputs, profile setup, and retrieval logic. It contains no external calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. Error handling ensures correct usage, and data flows are internal and safe. The code's purpose is configuration management, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs profile management tasks without malicious or obfuscated behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
