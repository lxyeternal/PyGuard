  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to instantiate Azure SDK clients using various authentication methods, including CLI profiles, JSON credentials, and auth files.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION), JSON files, and function input parameters for credentials and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Uses credentials and configuration data to instantiate SDK clients; does not directly send data to external systems or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and JSON data as input sources; flows into client instantiation functions which utilize credentials and configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; uses standard libraries and documented SDK functions; no suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles authentication and client instantiation for Azure SDKs. It reads credentials from environment variables, JSON files, or constructed dictionaries. It employs standard Azure SDK authentication flows, including deprecated methods such as adal.AuthenticationContext, which are documented and not inherently malicious. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be well-structured with proper warnings for deprecated usage. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for Azure SDK client creation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses accepted SDK practices and only accesses and processes configuration data as intended. No malicious behavior or sabotage identified.",
