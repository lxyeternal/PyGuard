  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating Azure SDK clients with various credential sources, including environment variables, JSON files, CLI profiles, and deprecated methods.",
  "sources": "Reads credentials, configuration data, environment variables, and JSON files; inspects class signatures.",
  "sinks": "Credentials and configuration passed into SDK client constructors; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source data (env vars, JSON, CLI credentials) flows into client instantiation via credential objects and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated functions (`get_client_from_cli_profile`, `get_client_from_json_dict`, `get_client_from_auth_file`), reflection via `get_arg_spec`, no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module for Azure SDK client creation, employing reflection and multiple credential sources. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The reliance on deprecated methods is a maintenance concern but not malicious. The code handles credentials securely in the context of SDK instantiation, with appropriate warnings about deprecated practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, intended for client setup, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary issue is reliance on outdated methods, which could pose future security or compatibility risks but do not constitute malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the outdated practices without indicating an immediate threat.",
