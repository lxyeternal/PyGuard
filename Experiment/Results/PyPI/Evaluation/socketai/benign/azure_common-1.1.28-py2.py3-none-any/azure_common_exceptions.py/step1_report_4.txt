  "purpose": "Import exception classes from msrest and msrestazure libraries, with dependency checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from msrest.exceptions and msrestazure.azure_exceptions modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only importing modules.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs imports with dependency checks.",
  "anomalies": "Standard import and dependency check pattern; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific exception classes from third-party libraries, handling ImportError by prompting the user to install missing packages. It performs dependency verification but does not process untrusted data or perform any suspicious operations. The code is straightforward and standard for Python projects that rely on external libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a routine dependency check for required exception classes from third-party libraries. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for a Python package initialization.",
