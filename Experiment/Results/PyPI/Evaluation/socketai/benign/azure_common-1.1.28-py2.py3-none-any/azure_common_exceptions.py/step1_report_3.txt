{
  "purpose": "The code aims to import specific exception classes from 'msrest' and 'msrestazure' libraries, providing import error messages if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "The source code reads data from the import statements, specifically attempting to import exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import modules and raising errors if not present, but no data flows or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices for dependency checking. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is dependency management, ensuring that required libraries 'msrest' and 'msrestazure' are installed. It uses try-except blocks to catch ImportError and provides informative messages if dependencies are missing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency check with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply ensures required modules are available, with clear error messages if not. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
