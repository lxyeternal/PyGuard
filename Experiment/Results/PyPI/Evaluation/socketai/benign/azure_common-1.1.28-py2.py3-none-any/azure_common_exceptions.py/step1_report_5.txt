{
  "purpose": "Import specific exception classes from 'msrest' and 'msrestazure' libraries to handle Azure-related errors in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'msrest.exceptions' and 'msrestazure.azure_exceptions' modules during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input could cause security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing exception classes; no untrusted data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code structure is standard for optional dependency checks; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import specific exception classes from external libraries required for error handling. If the libraries are not installed, it raises an ImportError with a message indicating the missing package. There are no data processing, network operations, or code execution flows that could be malicious. The code is straightforward dependency checking with exception handling for missing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency import block with error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It merely ensures necessary packages are available for error handling in an Azure SDK context.",
