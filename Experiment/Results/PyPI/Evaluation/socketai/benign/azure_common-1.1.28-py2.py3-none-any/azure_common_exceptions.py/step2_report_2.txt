  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward dependency import logic with error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks. The code's purpose is to ensure required dependencies are available, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that the code performs dependency checks without any suspicious behavior. No logical flaws or errors are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports and the code itself show no malicious intent or security risk, higher scores are unwarranted. The code is a standard dependency import pattern with no vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are based on the code snippet alone, with no assumptions about malicious intent. They correctly interpret the code as dependency management.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign dependency import check with no security concerns.**",
