{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import specific exception classes from the 'msrest' and 'msrestazure' libraries, with error handling to notify if dependencies are missing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'msrest.exceptions' and 'msrestazure.azure_exceptions'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; the code only raises ImportError if dependencies are missing.",
  "flows": "Dependency import attempts; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward dependency import and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard dependency check, importing exception classes from external libraries with error handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network activity, or execute dynamic code. The import failure handling is typical and benign. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code's purpose is to ensure dependencies are available, which it accomplishes safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency import block with standard error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
