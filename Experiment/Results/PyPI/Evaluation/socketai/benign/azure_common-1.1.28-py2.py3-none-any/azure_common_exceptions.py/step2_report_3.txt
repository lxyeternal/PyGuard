  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing exception classes from 'msrest' and 'msrestazure', with error handling if the modules are missing.\n- The code is straightforward, standard dependency management, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is not obfuscated (obfuscated score 0).\n- The purpose is dependency checking, not malicious activity.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or have any sinks.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; the code performs a benign dependency check with no security implications.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and do not raise any suspicion.\n- The import statements are standard, and error handling is conventional.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond dependency management.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- I concur with the reports' conclusions.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely dependency management, there's no indication of malicious intent or security risk. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
