  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the provided code snippet.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward dependency import and error handling block.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The import statements are standard, and the error handling is typical for dependency checks.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or signs of malware.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's goal—import exceptions from external libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard dependency check.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Same as above, with similar reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar observations; dependency import with error handling.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern; no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Again, standard dependency import pattern.\n- **Scores:** all zero — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking scores and potential issues:\n\n- **Malware score:** all reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** all zero, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** all zero, matching the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard dependency import with error handling, typical in Python projects.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or security concerns)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the nature of the code as a dependency check. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** The code snippet is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks.",
