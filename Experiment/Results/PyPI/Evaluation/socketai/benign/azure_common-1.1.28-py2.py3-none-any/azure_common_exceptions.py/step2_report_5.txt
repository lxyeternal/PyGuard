  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is straightforward: it attempts to import specific exception classes from two external libraries ('msrest' and 'msrestazure') and raises an ImportError with a message if the import fails.\n\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- The code performs dependency management, a common pattern in Python projects.\n\n**Step 2: Identify any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the purpose: dependency checking and import error handling.\n\n- They note the absence of data flow, sinks, or sources of untrusted data, which is accurate.\n\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n- The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n\n  - purpose: correct\n\n  - sources, sinks, flows: correctly identified as straightforward import statements with no data flow\n\n  - anomalies: none\n\n  - analysis: accurate\n\n  - confidence: 1.0 or 1, justified given the simplicity\n\n  - obfuscated: 0\n\n  - malware: 0\n\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any high risk or malware scores**\n\n- All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores as 0, which is justified.\n\n- No evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they interpret the code as dependency management, which is correct.\n\n**Step 6: Check for consistency**\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk beyond missing dependencies, which is handled explicitly)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the simplicity and transparency of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard dependency check with no security concerns.",
