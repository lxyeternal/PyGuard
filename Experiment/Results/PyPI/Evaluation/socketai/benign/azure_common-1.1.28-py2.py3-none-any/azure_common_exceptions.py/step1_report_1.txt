  "purpose": "The code aims to import exception classes from external libraries ('msrest' and 'msrestazure') and raises import errors if these libraries are not installed.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'msrest.exceptions' and 'msrestazure.azure_exceptions'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential vulnerabilities are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import dependencies; if not present, raise ImportError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is standard dependency import and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with importing specific exception classes from external modules and raising errors if the modules are not available. This is typical setup code for a library or application that depends on these packages. No malicious or suspicious code behavior is detected, and there are no sources or sinks of untrusted data or external control flow that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency check with explicit import error messages if dependencies are missing. No malicious intent or security risks are identified. The code is straightforward and safe.",
