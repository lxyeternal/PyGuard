  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward dependency import block, attempting to import specific exception classes from the 'msrest' and 'msrestazure' libraries.\n   - If the libraries are missing, it raises an ImportError with a clear message prompting installation.\n   - There are no data flows, no processing of untrusted data, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is typical setup or initialization code for an Azure SDK or related application.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or code that could be exploited.\n   - The import statements and error handling are standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious intent or code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified. The code is purely dependency management with no security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports seem to assume that dependency import failures could be malicious or risky, but in this context, they are standard dependency checks.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, nor any indication that the code could be used maliciously.\n\n5. **Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No changes needed; the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical dependency import check with no malicious or security concern.\n- All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) should remain at 0.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's straightforward purpose and the analysis provided.",
