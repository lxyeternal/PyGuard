  "purpose": "This code defines a version string for a software package, accompanied by licensing comments. It serves as metadata indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple static assignment with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single assignment of a version string to a variable. There are no functions, data flows, external inputs, or suspicious constructs. The code is typical boilerplate for package metadata. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence scores are 1.0, justified by the simplicity. No logical flaws or security concerns are present. The code poses no malicious or security threat, and the scores are consistent with its content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string declaration with licensing comments. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
