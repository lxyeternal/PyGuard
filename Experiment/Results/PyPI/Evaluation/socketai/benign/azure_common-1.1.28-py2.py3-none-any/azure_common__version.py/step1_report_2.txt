  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single version string assignment with licensing comments; no suspicious or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of comments, license information, and a version string assignment. There are no dynamic elements, input handling, or operations that could be malicious. The licensing comments indicate standard open-source practice, and the version string is typical for package versioning. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
