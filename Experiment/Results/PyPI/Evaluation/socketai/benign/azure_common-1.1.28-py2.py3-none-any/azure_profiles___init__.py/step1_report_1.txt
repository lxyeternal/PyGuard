{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and enums for managing Azure profile definitions and versions, allowing selection and usage of specific API versions.",
  "sources": "Importing 'Enum' from 'enum'; class attribute definitions; class methods; constructor and property methods; static and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or external command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization and usage of profile objects and enums, mainly involving internal attribute access and method calls without external data input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures (classes, enums) for managing Azure profile versions, with no external input processing, no network or file operations, and no code injection points. It contains static profile data, with no indications of malicious intent or behavior. The classes enforce type safety and controlled access to profile definitions. Overall, the code appears purely structural and configuration-oriented, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for Azure API profiles. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages static profile data with standard class and enum definitions.",
