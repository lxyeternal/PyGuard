  "purpose": "Defines profile management classes and known Azure profiles with versioning details.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum module; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. Profile data is static configuration; no malicious code appears present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions and static data structures to manage Azure profile versions. It uses enums, properties, and class methods to handle profile definitions. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or network operations. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The code simply manages version profiles for Azure SDK clients, which is standard configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as a configuration and profile management utility. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
