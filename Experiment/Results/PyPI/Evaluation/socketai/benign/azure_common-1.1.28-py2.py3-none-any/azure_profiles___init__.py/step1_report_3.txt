{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and enumerations for managing Azure profile definitions and versions, allowing users to select and switch API profiles.",
  "sources": "Import of the 'Enum' class from the 'enum' module, class constructors, property accessors, and class methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; code primarily manages data structures and profile settings without executing untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Initialization of profile objects -> usage of 'use()' method to set default profiles -> retrieval of profile definitions -> modification of class variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behavior. All data appears to be static configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures for managing Azure API profiles, including an Enum for known profiles and associated ProfileDefinition instances. It uses standard Python features such as classes, properties, and enums to organize this data. The code does not perform any external input/output, network activity, or system modifications. The only mutable state is managing profile selection, which is done through class methods and properties. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Overall, the code appears to serve as a configuration or utility module for API profile management without any security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration management utility for Azure API profiles. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The structure and static data suggest it is safe for inclusion in larger projects.",
