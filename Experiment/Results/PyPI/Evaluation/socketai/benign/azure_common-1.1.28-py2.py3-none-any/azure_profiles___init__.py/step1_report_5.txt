  "purpose": "Define and manage Azure profile versions and defaults, including known profiles with specific API version configurations.",
  "sources": "Initialization of classes, property accessors, and enum member definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that affects security; primarily configuration management.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from source to sink; the code primarily sets internal configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears to be configuration setup for profiles, with no evident malicious or anomalous activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling profiles, including a set of predefined Azure profiles with specific API versions. It uses Enum and class attributes to store and switch between profile configurations. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are processed dynamically. No functions perform network operations, data leaks, or system modifications. The code primarily manages internal profile data without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no obfuscation patterns, hidden code, or malicious intent observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration management module for Azure profiles, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines static profile data and provides mechanisms for selecting and using profiles. No evidence of malware or security threats present.",
