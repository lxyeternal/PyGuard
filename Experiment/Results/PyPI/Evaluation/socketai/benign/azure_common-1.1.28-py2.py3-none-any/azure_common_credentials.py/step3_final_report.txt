{
  "purpose": "The code manages Azure CLI profiles and credentials, providing token retrieval and session signing functionalities for SDK authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads local configuration files (azureProfile.json), imports internal profile methods, and accesses credentials via profile.get_login_credentials.",
  "sinks": "Returns credential objects, tokens, and signed sessions; potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data were processed, but none are present.",
  "flows": "Profile loading → credential retrieval → token generation or session signing; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated APIs and internal methods (_token_retriever), which could pose future compatibility issues but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard credential management tasks for Azure SDKs, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The reliance on deprecated APIs is a maintenance concern but does not introduce security risks. Internal method usage is documented and typical for SDK internal code. No suspicious network activity or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Azure CLI credential utility, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate due to deprecated API reliance but does not indicate a security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
