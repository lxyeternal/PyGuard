  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Azure-related HTTP errors with specific error subclasses.",
  "sources": "Import of version info from a local module (_version). No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exception objects; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up exception classes for Azure SDK error handling. It imports version info, defines custom exceptions, and dynamically changes class type based on status codes during instantiation. No input reading, data leaking, or malicious behavior patterns are present. The use of exception class swapping is standard for custom error handling and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Azure SDK errors. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
