  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling.\n- They highlight the import of version info from a local module, standard exception class hierarchy, and dynamic class assignment in __new__ based on status_code.\n- No external input reading, data leaks, or network calls are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports confidently conclude the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Assessment of the Code:**\n- The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for handling Azure HTTP errors.\n- The dynamic class remapping in __new__ is a common pattern for specialized error handling.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The only minor point is the security risk score of 0.1 in the last report, which seems to be an overestimation given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- The use of class swapping in __new__ is standard but could potentially cause confusion if misused; however, in this context, it appears correct and intended.\n- No hardcoded secrets or external data handling are present.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Scores Analysis:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports, consistent with benign code.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, accurate.\n- Risk score: All reports are at 0 or very close to 0; the last report's 0.1 is slightly higher but not justified by any malicious activity.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no changes needed.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- Since the code only defines exception classes with standard patterns, the risk of security issues is negligible.\n- The dynamic class remapping is a common pattern for detailed error handling.\n- No external or untrusted data is processed, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The risk score should be 0, given the lack of any security concern.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Risk: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
