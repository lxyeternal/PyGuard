  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling.\n- It imports version info from a local module (`_version`), which is standard.\n- The `__new__` method dynamically assigns exception subclasses based on the status code, which is a common pattern.\n- No external input reading, data leaks, or network activity is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, benign error handling setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  **No.** All reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious or security-related flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n\n- **Errors or mistakes in reports?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify the purpose, flow, and structure of the code. Their conclusions that the code is benign and standard are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Scores assessment:\n\n- **Confidence:**  \n  All reports have confidence scores of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  Most reports assign 0, with one report (report 5) assigning 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a small security risk score might be justified as a conservative measure, but it's not evidence of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Dynamic class swapping in `__new__`:**  \n  This is a common pattern for detailed error handling and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Any inconsistency in scores?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature. The only slight deviation is report 5's security risk of 0.1, which is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- All evidence points to no malicious activity.  \n- **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- Clearly not obfuscated.  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- The code is benign, but a minimal risk score of 0.0 or 0.1 could be assigned for conservative caution.  \n- Given the reports' scores, I agree with a **risk score of 0.1** for report 5, and 0 for others.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0.0 - 0.1       |\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The reports' assessments are accurate, and their scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo changes needed to the reports' conclusions or scores. They correctly identify the code as safe and straightforward.",
