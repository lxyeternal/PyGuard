{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling, including specialized errors for HTTP 404 and 409 status codes.",
  "sources": "Importing version information from a local module; no external data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation and raising, which are standard for error handling; no data leaks or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "Exception creation flows based on status code, leading to specific exception types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The use of class __new__ to dynamically assign exception types based on status code is standard in error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for Azure SDK, handling specific HTTP error codes by subclassing. The __new__ method alters exception class type based on status_code, which is a common pattern for detailed error handling. No input data sources or outputs to external systems are present; exception handling is standard and does not involve any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in an SDK context. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
