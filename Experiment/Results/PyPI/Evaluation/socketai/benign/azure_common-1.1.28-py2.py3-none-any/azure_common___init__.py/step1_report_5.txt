{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Azure-related errors, including HTTP errors and specific status code errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from a local module '_version' and uses static string metadata for author and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and exception handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version, defines custom exception classes for Azure errors, and overrides exception instantiation based on HTTP status codes. No input/output, network activity, or data handling is involved. The structure and content appear standard and straightforward, aimed at error handling within an SDK or client library.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard exception class definitions for Azure SDK error handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent. It is a benign and typical pattern for managing exceptions.",
