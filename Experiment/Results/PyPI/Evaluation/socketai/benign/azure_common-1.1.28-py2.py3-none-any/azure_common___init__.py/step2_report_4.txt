  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines custom exception classes for Azure SDK errors.\n- Uses class __new__ to dynamically assign subclasses based on status_code (404 → AzureMissingResourceHttpError, 409 → AzureConflictHttpError).\n- Imports version info from a local module (_version).\n- No input reading, data leaks, or external system interactions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The class swapping in __new__ is a common pattern for detailed error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic class assignment in __new__ is standard for error handling.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the purpose and behavior of the code. They note the absence of external data handling, data leaks, or malicious patterns. They also correctly interpret the class swapping as a common pattern.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0 or very low (0.1 in one case). This seems reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate. The code is purely for error handling and does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  No malicious activity is detected or suggested. The code does not perform network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions, correctly noting the standard pattern of exception handling.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis; no overestimation of risk.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended for error handling within an SDK.\n- The dynamic class swapping in __new__ is a common pattern, not malicious.\n- No external data or secrets are involved.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.** The code is benign, standard SDK error handling, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical implementation of custom exceptions for an SDK.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- The dynamic exception class swapping is a standard pattern, not suspicious.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This analysis assumes the code snippet is the entire file. If there are external modules (_version) involved, they should be checked for malicious content, but based on the provided code, no issues are present.",
