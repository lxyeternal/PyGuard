  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling, with dynamic class remapping based on HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local module (_version); no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and class remapping in __new__ based on status_code; standard exception hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard pattern for error handling, with no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical exception hierarchy with dynamic class assignment based on HTTP status codes (404, 409). It imports version info from a local module, defines exception classes, and uses __new__ for class remapping. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The class swapping pattern is common for detailed error handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
