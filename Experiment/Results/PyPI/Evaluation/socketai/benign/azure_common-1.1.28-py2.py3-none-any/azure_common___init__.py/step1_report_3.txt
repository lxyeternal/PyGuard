{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Azure-related HTTP errors with dynamic subclassing based on status codes.",
  "sources": "Import of version information from a local module (_version). No input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and class instantiation. No untrusted data processing or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exception objects, potentially with input messages and status codes, but no flow leading to data leaks or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. Standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions for Azure HTTP errors, including dynamic subclassing depending on status code (404, 409). It imports version info from a local module, defines exception hierarchies, and uses standard Python practices. No input sources, no sinks that process untrusted data, and no flow leading to security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for Azure SDK error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
