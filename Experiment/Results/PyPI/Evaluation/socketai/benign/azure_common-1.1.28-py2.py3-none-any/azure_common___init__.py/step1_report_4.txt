  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Azure-related HTTP errors with specific subclasses for common status codes.",
  "sources": "Import from ._version module for version info, and use of parameters passed to exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions, creating new exception instances, no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, status_code) flow into exception instances, which are raised or instantiated with no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, no external data handling, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to Azure HTTP errors. It imports a version value, defines exception classes, and dynamically remaps the class in __new__ based on the status code, redirecting to specific subclasses for 404 and 409 errors. There is no use of external input, no data leakage, no network calls, and no security-sensitive operations. The logic appears straightforward and solely focused on exception handling. No anomalies, malicious intent, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for Azure HTTP errors, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
