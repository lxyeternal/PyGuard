      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for managing Azure SDK profiles. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores are accurate; the minor overestimation of risk in one report should be corrected to zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Azure CLI credential utility, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate due to deprecated API reliance but does not indicate a security threat. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0."

The primary issue is reliance on outdated methods, which could pose future security or compatibility risks but do not constitute malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 appropriately reflects the outdated practices without indicating an immediate threat."
