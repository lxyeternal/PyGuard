  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'watchdog_gevent' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from the '__init__.py' file within the 'watchdog_gevent' directory.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data outputs or external calls that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file -> uses it in package setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The version extraction is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata, specifically the version, by reading a source file. It uses a helper function 'rel' to resolve file paths. The version is extracted by parsing a line starting with '__version__ =' from the '__init__.py' file. The setup() call defines package details and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or hidden behaviors are present. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate and standard setup configuration for a Python package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
