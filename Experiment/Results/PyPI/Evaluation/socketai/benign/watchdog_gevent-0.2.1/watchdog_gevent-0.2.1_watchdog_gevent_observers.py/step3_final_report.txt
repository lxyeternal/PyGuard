  "purpose": "Filesystem monitoring using gevent and watchdog libraries to detect directory and file changes.",
  "sources": "os.path.isdir, os.listdir, os.path.exists, os.path.isabs, os.path.join, os.path.abspath",
  "sinks": "queue_event calls with event objects (DirCreatedEvent, FileCreatedEvent, DirModifiedEvent, FileDeletedEvent, FileModifiedEvent, DirDeletedEvent)",
  "flows": "Source functions like _get_contents and os.path.* feed data into event queue via queue_event; _add spawns watchers that invoke _watch_dir or _watch_file, which generate events based on filesystem changes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; exception handling is broad but appropriate for filesystem operations",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard gevent-based filesystem watcher, with proper import checks, exception handling, and event queuing. It monitors directories and files, spawning greenlets for each, and generates appropriate events upon changes. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The code relies on well-known libraries and follows typical patterns for asynchronous filesystem monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a gevent-based filesystem monitoring system with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of approximately 0.1 are appropriate given its purpose and implementation.",
