  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs standard import handling with fallback logic and warnings. It finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and the report's assessment aligns well.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard import handling with no suspicious behavior. The confidence is slightly less (0.9), but still high.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues found; the report is consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical conditional import pattern with no signs of malicious activity. Confidence is high (1).\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern, standard fallback import with no suspicious behavior. Confidence is 1.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, straightforward import handling with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Analysis:** The code is a typical pattern for optional dependency handling in Python modules, with try-except blocks and warnings. No data is processed from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard pattern for managing optional dependencies with fallback mechanisms.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
