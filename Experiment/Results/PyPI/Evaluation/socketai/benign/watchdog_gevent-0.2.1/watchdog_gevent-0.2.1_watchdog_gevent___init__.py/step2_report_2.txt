  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward import setup with fallback logic.\n- No untrusted data handling, no code execution, no obfuscation.\n- The import pattern is common for optional dependencies.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The code is safe and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes import handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully justified.\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Justified; slightly less confidence but still appropriate.\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Justified.\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, as the code performs safe import handling with no security risks.\n\n**However, considering the overall context:**\n\n- The code is a standard pattern for optional dependency handling.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if we consider the fallback import pattern as a potential vector for misconfiguration, but in this case, it is benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a standard import pattern with fallback, no real security concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, with the understanding that the code is benign and standard. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- Slightly increase the overall risk score to 0.1 for completeness, but this is optional.\n\n**This code is safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.**",
