  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard import handling with fallback and warning mechanisms. No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified. The reasoning is sound, and the confidence level is high (1). The malware score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, this code manages optional imports with proper error handling and warnings. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still high. Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code handles conditional imports with warnings, no signs of malicious intent. The reasoning is consistent, and the confidence is high (1). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard fallback import pattern with no suspicious behavior. The confidence is 1, malware score 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The confidence is 1, malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is purely for import handling, with no data processing, network activity, or code injection. The code is straightforward and common in Python packages managing optional dependencies.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  None of the reports indicate obfuscated code; all scores for obfuscation are 0.\n\n- **Malware?**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Security Risks?**  \n  The code is safe; no security risks are evident.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the uniformity of the reports, the code, and the reasoning, I concur with the assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code is a typical pattern for optional dependency management in Python modules, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are justified. I agree with the assessments provided.",
