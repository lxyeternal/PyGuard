  "purpose": "Manage optional dependencies with fallback import logic and warnings in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'watchdog.observers' and local module '.observers', version and __all__ metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Attempted import of GeventObserver or GeventEmitter, fallback to warnings if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard import pattern with exception handling and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a common pattern for optional dependencies, attempting to import specific classes, with fallback to warnings if unavailable. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute malicious code. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard dependency management without malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, and security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
