  "purpose": "The code provides a client interface for managing dashboards in Sysdig Monitor, including creating, updating, adding panels, and removing panels.",
  "sources": "Reads data from method parameters, class attributes, and external API responses via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST and PUT requests to the Sysdig API endpoints, especially for dashboard creation and modification.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as dashboard templates, parameters, and scope expressions are processed and then transmitted over HTTP to the Sysdig API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets found; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code mainly handles API interactions and JSON manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around the Sysdig Monitor API to create, modify, and delete dashboards and panels. It performs data validation, constructs JSON payloads, and sends them via HTTP requests. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious data handling observed. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No suspicious functions or backdoors identified. The code is straightforward with standard API interaction patterns and no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for dashboard management in Sysdig Monitor, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not exhibit any malware signatures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows. Overall security risk is low.",
