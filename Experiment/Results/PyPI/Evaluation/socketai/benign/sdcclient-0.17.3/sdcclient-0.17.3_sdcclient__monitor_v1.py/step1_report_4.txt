  "purpose": "The code defines a client class for managing dashboards in Sysdig Monitor, including creating, editing, and removing dashboards and panels.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters, class attributes, and external HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST and PUT requests to external Sysdig API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and internal data structures flow into HTTP request payloads which are sent to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of external HTTP requests appears standard; no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard API client operations with no signs of malicious code. It processes data to configure dashboards and panels, with data sent securely over HTTP. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The HTTP requests use data from parameters and class attributes, which are expected in a normal API client scenario. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious code execution are detected. The code primarily manages dashboards through API calls and data manipulations, following typical patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in the logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for managing Sysdig dashboards without any malicious or sabotage behavior. It employs standard programming constructs, handles data securely, and does not contain hidden or suspicious functionality.",
