  "purpose": "API client for managing dashboards in Sysdig Monitor, including creating dashboards, adding/removing panels, and creating from templates.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, user inputs, API responses, configuration data sent via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST/PUT requests transmitting JSON payloads to API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are serialized into JSON and sent via HTTP; responses are processed to confirm actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK for dashboard management, performing expected API interactions without any malicious or suspicious logic. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with minimal validation appropriate for its context. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Data flows are predictable and typical for such clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk API client for dashboard operations. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
