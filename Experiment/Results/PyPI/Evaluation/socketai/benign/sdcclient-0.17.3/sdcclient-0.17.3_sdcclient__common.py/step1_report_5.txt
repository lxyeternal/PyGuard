{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client interface to interact with the Sysdig Monitor/Secure API, allowing operations such as user management, team management, notification channels, data retrieval, capture management, and access key handling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SDC_TOKEN, SDC_URL, SDC_SSL_VERIFY), input parameters for API calls (e.g., user details, team info, capture filters), user-supplied data in API request payloads.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests that send data to external Sysdig API endpoints, potentially transmitting user information, configuration data, or capture files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input parameters into API request payloads or URL parameters, then over HTTP/HTTPS to external Sysdig servers; responses are processed and returned. User info and tokens are fetched and stored locally for session management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; environment variables used for tokens; no obfuscated code; no dynamic code execution detected. The code performs extensive API interactions, but this is expected for a client library. No suspicious network domains or command execution. No malicious code patterns like backdoors, data exfiltration, or system sabotage are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive client class for interacting with the Sysdig API, handling user, team, notification, capture, and access key management through standard HTTP requests. It uses environment variables for sensitive tokens and constructs request payloads based on parameters. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or malicious network activity is detected. The code appears to be well-structured API client logic. While it performs many operations, they are legitimate functions of a monitoring client. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client for Sysdig, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles sensitive data appropriately via environment variables and performs expected API operations. No malware indicators or security risks are present.",
