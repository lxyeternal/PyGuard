  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a comprehensive Python client for Sysdig's API, managing users, teams, notifications, captures, and configurations.\n- It reads tokens and URLs from environment variables, which is standard practice.\n- All network interactions are via the `requests` library over HTTPS, with proper response validation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network domains are evident.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, system command invocation, or other malicious activities.\n- The request URLs, headers, and payloads are consistent with legitimate API client behavior.\n- Some minor inconsistencies (e.g., undefined variables like `product` in one method) suggest incomplete code snippets but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** API client for Sysdig, managing users, teams, notifications, etc.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears legitimate. The low security risk score is appropriate given the reliance on environment variables, which is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, a client for Sysdig API.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard use of environment variables.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The very low risk score reflects the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Client for Sysdig API, includes user, team, notifications, captures.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard API interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.95.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is a typical API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Client for Sysdig API, similar functionalities.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. Some incomplete code snippets noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is correct; the code appears legitimate. Minor code inconsistencies are likely due to incomplete snippets but do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** **Reasonable.** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Client for Sysdig API, managing users, teams, notifications, etc.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, standard API usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** **Appropriate.** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a legitimate, standard API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with their reasoning.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting careful analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 — low, primarily due to reliance on environment variables for tokens, which is standard but can be risky if environment variables are not secured.\n\n**However,** considering the nature of the code as an API client, the risk is inherently low but not zero. The main concern would be if tokens are compromised externally, but that is outside the scope of the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk due to environment variable usage)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for Sysdig with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current scores in the reports are appropriate, but I would slightly lower the risk score to 0.1 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Work out:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
