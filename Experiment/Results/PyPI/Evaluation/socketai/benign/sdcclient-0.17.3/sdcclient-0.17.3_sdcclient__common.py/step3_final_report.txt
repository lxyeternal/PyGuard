  "purpose": "A comprehensive Python client library for interacting with Sysdig's API, managing users, teams, notifications, captures, and configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for tokens and URLs; API request functions with user input and parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to API endpoints; response handling; data download functions.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or function parameters flows into API request payloads; responses processed for success or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation; no malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client that uses environment variables for sensitive data, performs HTTPS requests with retries, and handles responses appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Minor code inconsistencies are present but do not impact security. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, secure, and transparent API client for Sysdig, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects standard practices and the absence of suspicious activity.",
