  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of code behavior, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client library for Sysdig API, managing users, teams, notifications, captures, configs. No hardcoded secrets; tokens from environment variables; no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The analysis finds no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the detailed analysis. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, justified by reliance on environment variables, which is standard but can be risky if environment is compromised.\n\n**Conclusion:** The score seems reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, the code is a legitimate API client, handling tokens via environment variables, with standard request/response flows. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified as standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a comprehensive API client with environment variables for tokens, standard HTTPS requests, no malicious code or obfuscation. Content downloads are handled properly.\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the report's conclusion.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar findings; no malicious patterns, no obfuscation, tokens from environment variables, standard API interactions.\n\n- **Malware:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client for Sysdig, with environment variables for tokens, standard API calls, no malicious activity or obfuscation. The analysis confirms legitimacy.\n\n- **Malware:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but still justified given the use of environment variables and extensive API interactions, which are typical for such clients.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Sysdig, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n- The risk scores are low, justified by standard practices and no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity across all reports.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — low, acceptable given the code's purpose; slightly higher than zero due to environment variable usage, but this is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a standard, legitimate API client with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores reflect this assessment appropriately.",
