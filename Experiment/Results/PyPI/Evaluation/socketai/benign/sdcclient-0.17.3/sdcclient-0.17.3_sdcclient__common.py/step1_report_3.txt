{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client interface to interact with the Sysdig Monitor/Secure API, including user management, team management, notifications, data retrieval, capture management, and access key management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., SDC_TOKEN, SDC_URL, SDC_SSL_VERIFY), user inputs for function arguments, HTTP request responses, and data from environment variables for SSL verification.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests via the requests library (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), JSON serialization of data payloads, and content download (res.content).",
  "flows": "Environment variables and function parameters provide input data; data is used to build API requests and payloads; responses are parsed and returned; some responses are used to determine subsequent API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. No malicious obfuscation or obfuscated code detected. No indications of malicious network connections, system disruption, or data exfiltration. Use of environment variables for credentials is standard, not malicious. The class handles API interactions securely. No suspicious or malicious logic is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive client for the Sysdig API, handling various functionalities such as user, team, notification, capture, and access key management. It retrieves tokens and configuration data from environment variables, which is common for API clients. All data exchanges occur via HTTPS requests with appropriate headers. There are no code injections, reverse shells, system modifications, or network connections to suspicious domains. The download function retrieves capture data content directly. The code does not contain any backdoors, hidden behaviors, or malicious payloads. All functions appear consistent with their intended purpose and do not perform malicious or unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client for Sysdig monitoring and security platform, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely manages API interactions, user, and team data, and supports standard functionalities. No malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
