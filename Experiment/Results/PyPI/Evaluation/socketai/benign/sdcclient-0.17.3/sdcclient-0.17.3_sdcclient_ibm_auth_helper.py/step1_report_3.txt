  "purpose": "Authenticate with IBM Cloud IAM to obtain access tokens and headers for API requests.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: url, apikey, guid; also, responses from the requests.post call.",
  "sinks": "The response.json()['access_token'] which is used in Authorization headers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> __get_iam_token() -> requests.post -> response.json() -> get headers with 'Bearer ' + token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class for obtaining IAM tokens from IBM Cloud, using standard API calls. It correctly determines environment URLs based on input and securely retrieves tokens. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The use of requests.post for token retrieval and handling of response data is standard practice. The code does not include any data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be legitimate and designed solely for authentication purposes. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is detected.",
