  "purpose": "Helper class for obtaining IBM Cloud IAM access tokens via HTTPS POST request, dynamically selecting endpoint based on URL content.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: url, apikey, guid; network request to 'https://<endpoint>/identity/token'.",
  "sinks": "The HTTPS POST request to retrieve the token; the token is used in headers for authentication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> __get_iam_endpoint() -> requests.post() -> response.json()['access_token'] -> get_headers() -> headers with Bearer token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Endpoint selection based on URL substring is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard OAuth token retrieval for IBM Cloud IAM, with proper endpoint selection and HTTPS communication. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The handling of API keys and tokens is typical and does not involve insecure practices. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with legitimate authentication flows. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to sensitive data handling, which is standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward helper for IBM Cloud IAM authentication with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk score is low, and malware likelihood is zero. The assessments and scores from the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
