{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for dashboard and event client classes, facilitating their import in other parts of a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports of specific classes from internal modules (_dashboards_v2, _dashboards_v3, _events_v1, _events_v2).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; purely static imports and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. The naming conventions and structure are standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from internal modules and declares an __all__ list for controlling exports. No user input handling, no network operations, no code execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. This is typical boilerplate for Python packages to organize public API surface.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization code with no malicious behavior. There are no indicators of security risks or malware; it simply manages module exports.",
