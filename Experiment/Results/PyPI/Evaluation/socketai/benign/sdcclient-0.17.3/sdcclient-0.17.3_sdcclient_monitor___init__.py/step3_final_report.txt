  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file, importing specific classes from internal modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (_dashboards_v2, _dashboards_v3, _events_v1, _events_v2)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports and exports symbols without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setup, importing classes from internal modules and defining __all__ for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are from internal, presumably trusted modules, and no untrusted data handling or network operations are present. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate a benign purpose, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for module exports, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 from previous reports can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy, and overall, the code is safe for use.",
