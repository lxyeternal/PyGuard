  "purpose": "Exporting client classes for dashboards and events API versions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_dashboards_v2, _dashboards_v3, _events_v1, _events_v2).",
  "targets": "__all__ list indicating exported classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; the code only exports imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard module export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. No user input, environment variables, or network activity is present. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns observed. The structure suggests a simple package API interface. All imports and exports seem standard for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module interface defining exports for client classes. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
