  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is boilerplate code for module exports, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are both 0, and securityRisk is 0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes standard import/export patterns with no malicious intent. Slight mention of a securityRisk score of 0.1, which seems marginal.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, securityRisk is 0.1.\n- **Justification for securityRisk:** Given the code is just imports and exports, a score of 0.1 is probably too high unless there's an external concern about the imported modules.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should likely remain at 0, unless there's evidence that the internal modules (_dashboards_v2, etc.) are malicious, which is not indicated here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above—standard import/export code with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero for malware and obfuscated, securityRisk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same assessment—standard module interface code.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with previous reports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, standard import/export code.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward module setup.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** The only point of contention is the securityRisk score in Report 2, which is 0.1. Given the code snippet's simplicity, this should be 0 unless there's external context indicating malicious modules.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code is standard package initialization code, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks evident.\n- The scores assigned are generally appropriate, except for Report 2's securityRisk, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, purely boilerplate for module exports, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are mostly accurate, but the securityRisk score in Report 2 should be adjusted downward to reflect the lack of any real concern.",
