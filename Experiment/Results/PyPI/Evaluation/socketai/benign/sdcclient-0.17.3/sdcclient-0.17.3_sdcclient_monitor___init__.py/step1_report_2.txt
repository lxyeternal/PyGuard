{
  "purpose": "This code defines module imports and exports for various client classes related to dashboards and events, likely part of a larger package or SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (._dashboards_v2, ._dashboards_v3, ._events_v1, ._events_v2).",
  "sinks": "The __all__ list exports references to imported classes, no direct sinks for untrusted data in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported classes could potentially be instantiated and used elsewhere; no direct data flow within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard package module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and declares them for export. There is no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated elements, and no indications of malicious activity. It appears to be standard package module initialization code. The only concern would be if the imported modules contain malicious code, but within this snippet, nothing suspicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified in this snippet.",
