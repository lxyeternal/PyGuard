{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for different client classes related to dashboards and events, likely part of a package's API interface.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from internal modules (e.g., ._dashboards_v2, ._events_v1).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the internal module files into the imported classes, then to the __all__ list for module exports; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present; the code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from internal modules, which appear to be named systematically for versioning. It then exposes these classes via the __all__ list for module interface. The code is clean, minimal, and adheres to typical Python package conventions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behavior. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export setup for a Python package, with no malicious or security concern indications. It appears legitimate and safe.",
