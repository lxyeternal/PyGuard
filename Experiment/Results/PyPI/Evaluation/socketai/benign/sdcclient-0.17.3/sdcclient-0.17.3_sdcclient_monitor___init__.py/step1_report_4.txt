  "purpose": "This code is for importing specific client classes from local modules related to dashboards and events, and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_dashboards_v2, _dashboards_v3, _events_v1, _events_v2)",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or actions in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports class references.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns observed. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. No input handling, network communication, or dynamic execution present. The code appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module interface setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export configuration with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package structure.",
