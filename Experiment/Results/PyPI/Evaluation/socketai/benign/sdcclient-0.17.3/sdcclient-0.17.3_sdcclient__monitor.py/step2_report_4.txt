  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of code behavior, potential security issues, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client for Sysdig Cloud, with functions for alerts, notifications, configs, etc. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Regex used for scope parsing is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious activity or malware signs. The low security risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with API wrapper functions. The analysis emphasizes standard API interactions, no malicious behavior, and straightforward regex parsing.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No signs of malware or obfuscation. Slightly higher risk score possibly due to data flow through untrusted inputs, but still within normal bounds.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with CRUD operations. No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. Regex for scope parsing is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. No malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard API client functions. No suspicious code or behavior. Regex parsing is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: legitimate API client, no malicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the straightforward, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's nature as an API client, these are reasonable. No evidence of security vulnerabilities beyond standard API interactions.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malware)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (small, inherent API interaction risk, but nothing alarming)\n\n**Note:** The scores given in the reports are consistent with the detailed reasoning. The overall assessment indicates no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2                    |\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code appears safe and legitimate.",
