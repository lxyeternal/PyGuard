  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client for Sysdig Cloud, with functions for alerts, notifications, configs, etc. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Regex in scope parsing is straightforward. Overall, legitimate API client code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard API client with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence level (0.95) aligns with the findings.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low). These seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, but notes potential data flow from untrusted inputs into API requests, scope string parsing with regex, but no signs of malicious activity. No backdoors or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is cautious but concludes the code is a legitimate API client. The risk score (0.2) is slightly higher than report 1, reflecting some attention to untrusted data handling, but still low.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. These are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with emphasis on standard API interactions, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets, no malicious network activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with previous assessments. The risk score remains low (0.2), which is appropriate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with focus on data flow via API calls, no malicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation, standard regex parsing.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior conclusions. The risk score remains low.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a straightforward API client, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets, standard practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent, and the risk score (0.2) is appropriate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified given the code's nature. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's purpose as an API client and the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code, these scores are reasonable.\n\n### Final Justified Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malware or malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client with minimal security considerations)\n\n**Note:** The only potential concern is the handling of untrusted input in scope string parsing, but the code performs validation and uses regex carefully. No evidence suggests any security risk from this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Sysdig, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores across reports are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.",
