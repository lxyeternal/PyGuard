  "purpose": "Client library for interacting with Sysdig Cloud API, managing alerts, notifications, group configurations, metrics, and scope parsing.",
  "sources": "API request parameters, class attributes, and response data from HTTP calls.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests over network; no sensitive data handling beyond standard tokens; no secrets hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Parameters and method inputs flow into API request payloads; responses are processed via JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; regex used for scope parsing is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client with functions for CRUD operations on alerts, notifications, and configurations. It uses standard network requests, with input validation and regex parsing for scope expressions. No suspicious data handling, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. Regex parsing is used for expression validation, not malicious obfuscation. No secrets are embedded; the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Sysdig services. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The regex parsing is standard and not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
