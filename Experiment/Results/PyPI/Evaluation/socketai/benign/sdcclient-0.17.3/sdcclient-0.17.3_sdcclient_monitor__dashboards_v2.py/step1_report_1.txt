  "purpose": "This code provides a client for managing dashboards via an API, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving dashboards and views.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters, external files (JSON), and API responses.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to API endpoints via HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE); reads from files.",
  "flows": "User inputs or external data -> processed and manipulated within functions -> sent via HTTP requests to external API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard library modules and external API interactions are normal. No obfuscated code or unusual language features identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical API client operations for dashboard management, including creating, updating, deleting, and copying dashboards, with proper use of deepcopy to prevent side-effects. External interactions involve reading from files and making HTTP requests. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are observed. It handles input and output securely, assuming external API endpoints are trustworthy. The structure is straightforward and matches standard API client patterns. No suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for managing dashboards, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows expected patterns for such a client, with proper handling of external data and API interactions. Overall, it is safe based on this review.",
