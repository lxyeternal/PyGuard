  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** API client for dashboards, standard CRUD operations.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Reads input from parameters, files; writes via HTTP requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward API client; no malicious behavior or malicious code patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2, confidence: 0.9\n\n*Assessment:* The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The security risk is minimal, given the code's nature. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client for managing dashboards, similar to Report 1.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** API responses, user inputs, JSON files.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard REST API client; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate.\n\n**Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1\n\n*Assessment:* Scores are appropriate. The code is straightforward and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client for managing dashboards, similar pattern.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** HTTP requests, JSON files.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard API client, responsible JSON handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 0.95\n\n*Assessment:* Scores are justified; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client for dashboards in Sysdig Cloud.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** API calls, JSON files.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis:** Typical API client; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk.\n\n**Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 0.9\n\n*Assessment:* Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client for managing dashboards, similar pattern.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** API, JSON files.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Analysis:** Standard management client.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 0.9\n\n*Assessment:* Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** All are low (0.2 or 0), which makes sense given the code's nature as an API client without any evident vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical API client for dashboard management, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The high confidence levels reflect the thorough review and the lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client with minimal inherent risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
