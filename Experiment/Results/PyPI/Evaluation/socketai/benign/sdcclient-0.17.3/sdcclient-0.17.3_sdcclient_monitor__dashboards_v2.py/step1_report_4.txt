  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for managing dashboards in Sysdig Cloud, including creating, updating, deleting, and importing dashboards and views via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to API endpoints; reading JSON files from disk; converting scope strings to expressions.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external Sysdig endpoints; reading JSON files from disk; writing dashboard data to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON files or user inputs (scope strings, dashboard configurations) through functions that manipulate or send data via HTTP requests to Sysdig Cloud API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard API interaction patterns and library functions. The code properly handles input validation and data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a client implementation for managing dashboards in Sysdig Cloud. It uses standard libraries (copy, json) and imports from the sdcclient package. It performs HTTP requests to manage dashboards, including creating, updating, deleting, and importing dashboards from files or templates. It handles scope expressions, dashboard configurations, and file I/O for JSON serialization/deserialization. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors are evident. It appears to be a legitimate API client with proper data handling. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The code functions as a typical API client wrapper, with input validation and JSON processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and legitimate implementation of a Sysdig dashboard management client. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or supply chain attacks. It handles API interactions and file operations securely and predictably.",
