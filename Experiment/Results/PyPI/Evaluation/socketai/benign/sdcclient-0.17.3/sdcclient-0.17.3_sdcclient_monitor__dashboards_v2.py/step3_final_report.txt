{
  "purpose": "The code is a client library for managing dashboards via REST API, providing functions for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting dashboards, as well as handling dashboard templates and views.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to fetch dashboards, views, and templates; reading JSON files for dashboard configurations; input parameters for functions like dashboard data and names.",
  "sinks": "HTTP PUT/POST requests to update or create dashboards; writing JSON files when saving dashboards to disk.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (dashboard data, names, files) -> API requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) -> responses -> function outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No backdoors or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical API interactions for dashboard management, with proper use of deep copies to prevent side effects, standard JSON serialization, and no signs of malicious behavior. It handles file input/output securely, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is justified as zero. The obfuscation score is zero due to code clarity. The low risk score (~0.2) accounts for external API interactions but does not indicate any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for dashboard management with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall security posture is low risk.",
