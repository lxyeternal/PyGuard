{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and classes from the 'sdcclient' package related to security, monitoring, scanning, and authentication, and exposes them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sdcclient' modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code contains only static import declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import setup without data processing or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements and __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup with import statements and an __all__ list, with no functions, data handling, or dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The imported modules are typical for a security SDK. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The slight variation in risk score (0.1) in one report is a cautious estimate but can be considered negligible. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for a security SDK, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
