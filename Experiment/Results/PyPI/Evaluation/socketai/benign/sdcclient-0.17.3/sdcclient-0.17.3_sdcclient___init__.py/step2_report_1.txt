  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports identify that the code is solely composed of import statements from the 'sdcclient' package, including various modules and classes related to security, monitoring, scanning, and authentication.\n- They consistently conclude that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware scores are uniformly 0, indicating no malicious behavior is observed or suspected.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), aligning with the benign nature of import statements.\n\n**Confirmations and considerations:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, consisting only of import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data flows, untrusted data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The imported modules and classes are typical for a security or monitoring SDK, and their presence alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- The consistent absence of anomalies or suspicious patterns supports the conclusion that this code is benign.\n\n**Potential issues or flaws:**\n\n- The reports are accurate; the code does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only minor point is that the import of `IbmAuthHelper` could be involved in authentication, but without further context, it does not raise security concerns.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The overall security risk scores are very low, matching the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a typical setup module for a security monitoring SDK, with no malicious or security-compromising elements. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — Very low, primarily because it involves imports, which could be part of a larger system but pose no risk in isolation.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n- The code is purely import statements with no executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The presence of authentication helpers does not imply malicious intent; they are standard in security SDKs.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe report's assessments are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No changes are necessary.",
