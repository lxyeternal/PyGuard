{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a client wrapper for the Sysdig Secure API, enabling CRUD operations on rules, macros, lists, compliance tasks, image profiles, and other resources through HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "User-controlled parameters used in URL string formatting (e.g., in get_rules_group, get_falco_macros_group, list_compliance_results, etc.), and data payloads constructed via json.dumps().",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that send data and URLs to the API server; potential injection points if inputs are malicious and not sanitized.",
  "flows": "User inputs (parameters) flow into URL strings and JSON payloads via string formatting, then are sent through HTTP methods to the API server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with user-supplied parameters for URL construction without explicit sanitization; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with functions for resource management, constructing URLs dynamically with user inputs. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage. The primary concern is potential injection via URL parameters, but this is typical for such clients assuming backend sanitization. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate API wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Sysdig Secure, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The main security consideration is input sanitization in URL parameters, which is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical minimal concerns for API clients. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
