  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Sysdig Secure, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The main security consideration is input sanitization in URL parameters, which is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical minimal concerns for API clients. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9)."
