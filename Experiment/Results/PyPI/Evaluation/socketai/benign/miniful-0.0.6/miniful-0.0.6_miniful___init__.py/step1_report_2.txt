  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'miniful' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .miniful import *",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any functions or classes imported from 'miniful' could serve as sinks if used maliciously, but this code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flow in this line alone; it only imports symbols from another module.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'import *' can hide which components are imported, potentially masking malicious or unintended code. No specific malicious behavior is evident in this import statement itself, but the use of wildcard import can hide suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'miniful' module within the same package. It does not execute any code or contain direct malicious behavior. However, the use of 'import *' can obscure the imported symbols, which might hide malicious functions or variables if present in 'miniful'. Without inspecting the contents of 'miniful', no definitive malicious activity can be confirmed. The code is minimal and straightforward but lacks explicit control over imported symbols.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple relative import using a wildcard, which by itself does not indicate malicious intent. However, it may be used to conceal malicious imports within 'miniful'. No direct malicious behavior is detected from this snippet alone.",
