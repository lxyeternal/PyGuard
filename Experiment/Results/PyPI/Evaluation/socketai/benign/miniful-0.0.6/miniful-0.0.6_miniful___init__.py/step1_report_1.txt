{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'miniful' module, likely to use its functions or classes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'miniful'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports all entities from 'miniful', but no further data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is being imported, which might hide malicious code or unintended behaviors. No other anomalies are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports everything from a local module named 'miniful'. Without seeing the content of 'miniful', it is impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists within that module. The use of 'import *' can be a code smell if the module contains hidden or malicious code, but in isolation, this line alone does not demonstrate malicious intent. No other suspicious activity or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not contain malicious behavior but raises a minor concern due to the use of 'import *', which can conceal unwanted imports. Additional review of the 'miniful' module is necessary for a thorough security assessment.",
