  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the miniful module, likely to extend or utilize its functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package referencing miniful module",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data handling evident in this line",
  "flows": "N/A (single import statement, no data flow analysis possible from this snippet alone)",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') which can hide imported symbols and potentially import malicious or unintended code if the module is compromised; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import from a local module, which is a common but discouraged practice due to namespace pollution and potential security issues if the module is malicious. Without inspecting the miniful module itself, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The import statement alone does not execute code or handle data directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import operation, with the only concern being the use of a wildcard import that can obscure the source of imported functions or classes. No malicious activity is evident from this line alone, but the security posture depends on the contents of the miniful module.",
