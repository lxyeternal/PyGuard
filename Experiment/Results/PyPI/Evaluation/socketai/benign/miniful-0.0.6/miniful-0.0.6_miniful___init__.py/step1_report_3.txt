  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'miniful' module in the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'miniful' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "Importing modules generally does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious effects, but if 'miniful' contains malicious code, it could execute upon import.",
  "flows": "Import statement executes the code in 'miniful', which could include source-to-sink flows if 'miniful' performs malicious actions during import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement; however, importing all from a module can hide malicious code execution within 'miniful'. No direct anomalies in this snippet, but reliance on external module code introduces risk.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports all contents from the 'miniful' module located in the same package. This is a minimal import statement and does not itself contain malicious behavior. However, it depends entirely on the contents of 'miniful'. If 'miniful' contains malicious code (e.g., backdoors, data exfiltration, malicious system calls), then importing it could trigger such behavior. No other suspicious or unusual code structures are present. Since the analysis is based solely on this line, the actual risk depends on the 'miniful' module's implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code by itself is benign, but it acts as a potential trigger for malicious behavior if 'miniful' contains malicious code. Without reviewing 'miniful', the security risk cannot be fully assessed, but the import pattern itself is not inherently suspicious.",
