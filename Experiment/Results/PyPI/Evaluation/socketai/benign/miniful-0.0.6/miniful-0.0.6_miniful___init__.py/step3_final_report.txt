{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'miniful' module, potentially bringing in malicious or unintended code.",
  "sources": "The relative import statement 'from .miniful import *', which loads symbols from the 'miniful' module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "Any functions or variables imported from 'miniful' that could be executed later or used maliciously, especially if 'miniful' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads symbols into the namespace; subsequent code could invoke functions or access variables from 'miniful', potentially leading to malicious actions if 'miniful' is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which obscures imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious functions or variables; minimal code with no direct malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from 'miniful'. This pattern is discouraged due to obscurity and potential hiding of malicious code. The snippet itself is benign; however, the security risk depends on the contents of 'miniful'. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious activity is evident from the import alone. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting the concern that 'import *' can hide malicious functions if 'miniful' is compromised. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the minimal code and lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The use of 'import *' warrants further review of 'miniful' to ensure it does not contain malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is not malicious but introduces a risk of obscuring malicious code within 'miniful'. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood and moderate security risk due to import obscurity. Further inspection of 'miniful' is necessary for a definitive assessment.",
