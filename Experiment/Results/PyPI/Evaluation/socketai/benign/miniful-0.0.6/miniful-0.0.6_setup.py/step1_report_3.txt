  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'miniful' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "User input: package metadata (name, version, description, author info, URL, keywords, license, dependencies, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to a GitHub repository, which is typical; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core' for package setup, defines package metadata including author contact and repository URL, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and classifiers for Python versions. No dynamic code, no external data input handling, and no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate package distribution purposes.",
