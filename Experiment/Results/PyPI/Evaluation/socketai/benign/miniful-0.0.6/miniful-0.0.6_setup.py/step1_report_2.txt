  "purpose": "Define and configure the 'miniful' Python package for distribution using distutils.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call: package name, version, description, author info, URL, keywords, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no dynamic code execution, network communication, or user input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; configuration data is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward setup script with no unusual code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library named 'miniful'. It specifies dependencies, metadata, and classifiers. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are present. The URL points to a GitHub repository, which appears benign, although verification of its content is outside this script's scope. The script does not contain any code that could be used maliciously or that indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
