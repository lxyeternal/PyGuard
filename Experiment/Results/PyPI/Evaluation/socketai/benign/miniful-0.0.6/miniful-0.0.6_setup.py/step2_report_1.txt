  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script, with static metadata, dependencies, and no dynamic or user-input-driven behavior.\n- The only potentially suspicious element is the URL pointing to `https://github.com/aresio/stfu`. The name \"stfu\" could be benign or suspicious, but from the code alone, it's just a repository link.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present in the code snippet.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a typical setup script; no issues or anomalies in syntax or logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no code execution, dynamic code, or data processing.\n- **Potential concern:** The URL \"https://github.com/aresio/stfu\" could be a placeholder or malicious, but the code itself does not process or fetch data from it.\n\n### Specific review of scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is static and standard.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1, 1.0, or 0.9) are justified given the code's simplicity.\n- The risk score of 0.1 in report 1 might be slightly high, considering the URL could be suspicious, but since the code does not process it, the actual risk remains minimal. I would suggest lowering it to 0 or 0.1 at most.\n- The malware scores are appropriate at 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the static, benign nature of the code, and no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but keeping minimal due to the suspicious URL reference)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The only minor concern is the URL, which does not impact the code's security directly.\n- The current malware and obfuscated scores are correct.\n- The risk score could be lowered to 0, but 0.1 is acceptable for cautiousness.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
