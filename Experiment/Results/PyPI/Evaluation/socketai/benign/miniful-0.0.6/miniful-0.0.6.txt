The only minor concern is the URL's name, which does not impact the code's security directly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal, approximately 0.1 due to the URL's suspicious name but no evidence of malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of fuzzy logic reasoning with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The low risk score (~0.2) due to abrupt error handling is appropriate but could be improved with exception handling for robustness."

      "conclusion": "The import statement itself is not malicious but introduces a risk of obscuring malicious code within 'miniful'. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood and moderate security risk due to import obscurity. Further inspection of 'miniful' is necessary for a definitive assessment."
