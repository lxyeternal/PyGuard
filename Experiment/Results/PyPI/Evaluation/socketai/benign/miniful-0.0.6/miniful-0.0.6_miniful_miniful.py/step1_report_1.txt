{
  "purpose": "The code implements a fuzzy logic reasoning system with classes for fuzzy sets, membership functions, rules, and a reasoner, intended for fuzzy inference and visualization.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from input parameters such as points for fuzzy sets, variables for rules, and function arguments in methods like evaluate(), get_value(), and evaluate_rules(). No external data sources or untrusted input streams are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, network communication, or file operations are present. The code only performs calculations and plotting internally without external data leaks or transmissions.",
  "flows": "Input data (points, variables) flows into fuzzy set and rule objects; evaluation methods process these inputs; the result flows through the reasoning process into output values, mainly for visualization or inference results.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains import statements within methods (e.g., seaborn, scipy), which can be inefficient but are not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The 'exit()' calls could terminate the process abruptly, which is unconventional but not malicious. No apparent malicious code behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of fuzzy logic inference, with classes for fuzzy sets, membership functions, rules, and a reasoner. It uses standard libraries for numerical computation and plotting. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data theft, network activity, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The presence of multiple import statements within functions is a minor concern but not malicious. The abrupt use of exit() in error handling could disrupt normal operation but is not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code performs typical fuzzy inference tasks without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward fuzzy logic reasoning implementation with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not include any network operations, data exfiltration, or covert backdoors. It appears to be a benign utility for fuzzy inference and visualization.",
