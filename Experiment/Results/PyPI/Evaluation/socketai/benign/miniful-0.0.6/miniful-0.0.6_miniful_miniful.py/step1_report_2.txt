{
  "purpose": "The code implements a fuzzy logic reasoning system, including classes for fuzzy sets, membership functions, fuzzy rules, and a reasoner, for use in fuzzy inference applications.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters, function arguments, and class attributes, notably in methods like get_values, evaluate, and set_variable.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include output of evaluate methods, plotting functions, and any network or file operations (none present in the code).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables to fuzzy set evaluations, then through rules to produce output values, but no external data or untrusted sources are explicitly used or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. Use of exit() calls for error handling is notable but not malicious. Importing seaborn and scipy.interpolate suggests visualization; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for fuzzy logic operations, including fuzzy sets, membership functions, rules, and a reasoner. It reads input data via class methods and processes it through fuzzy inference. No external data sources, network operations, or code that could transmit or leak data are present. The plotting functions are for visualization only, and error handling uses standard exit() calls. The code appears to be a standard fuzzy logic implementation without malicious intent or covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate fuzzy inference system implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs standard fuzzy logic operations, with visualization support, and does not contain any suspicious or harmful code elements.",
