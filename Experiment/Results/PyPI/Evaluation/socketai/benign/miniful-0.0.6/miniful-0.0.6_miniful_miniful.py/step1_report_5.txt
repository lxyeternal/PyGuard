{
  "purpose": "The code implements a fuzzy logic system with classes for fuzzy sets, membership functions, fuzzy rules, and a fuzzy reasoner for inference and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as points for fuzzy sets, variables for reasoning, and rules for inference. It also imports data from libraries like scipy and numpy.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs include plotting functions using seaborn and matplotlib, and evaluation results of fuzzy rules. There are no apparent data leaks or direct data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables into fuzzy sets and membership functions, then through rule evaluation, culminating in visualization or inference outputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and functions typical for fuzzy logic implementations. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. No network calls or external data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for fuzzy sets, membership functions, and rules, all functioning as expected for a fuzzy inference system. The implementation includes methods for evaluation, interpolation, and plotting. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secretive operations are present. The code strictly performs computational fuzzy logic operations and visualization without any suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a fuzzy logic system with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard libraries and performs expected operations for fuzzy inference and visualization. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
