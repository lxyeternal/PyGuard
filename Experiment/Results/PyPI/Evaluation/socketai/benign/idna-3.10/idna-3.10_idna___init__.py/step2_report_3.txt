  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a straightforward Python module that imports various functions and constants related to IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) processing.\n   - There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation techniques in this snippet.\n   - The code simply imports and exposes functions and variables, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" messages with no additional details or explanations.\n   - Without specific content, it's impossible to determine if the reports identify real issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n   - The lack of details makes it difficult to assess whether the reports are valid or based on assumptions.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Since no specific issues are detailed, assigning high risk, malware, or obfuscation scores would be unwarranted.\n   - Without concrete evidence, scores should be minimal or zero.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - The code appears benign; it performs import/export functions without any suspicious activity.\n   - No malware-like behavior (e.g., code injection, obfuscation, malicious network activity) is evident.\n   - The risk score should be very low, likely close to 0, unless new evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, they seem to be either placeholders or incomplete.\n   - Any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware based solely on this code would be unfounded.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Given the lack of evidence, the scores should be consistent with a benign, well-structured module.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the absence of context; generally safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are empty and do not provide any concrete evidence of issues. Based on the code snippet, there are no indications of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation. Therefore, the scores should reflect a benign status, with very low risk and malware scores.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease provide more detailed reports if available for a more thorough review.",
