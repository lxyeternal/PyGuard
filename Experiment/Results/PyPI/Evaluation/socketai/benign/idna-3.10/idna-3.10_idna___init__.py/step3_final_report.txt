{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module initializer, importing various error classes, functions, and data related to IDNA processing and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core, .intranges, .package_data) such as error classes, validation functions, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows, merely imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines symbols for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import/export structure and no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python module setup, importing internal components and defining __all__ for public API exposure. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident. The reports provided are empty, containing only 'Empty response' messages, which do not offer any information for further analysis. Given the lack of detailed findings, no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors can be inferred. The code appears benign and standard, with scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk logically set to zero.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code and the incomplete reports, there is no evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation. The code is standard and safe. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. Therefore, all security-related scores should be set to zero, indicating a benign status.",
