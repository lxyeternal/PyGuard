  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code behavior, potential malicious activity, validation logic, external dependencies, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard IDNA implementation with extensive Unicode validation, relying on external modules (idnadata, intranges, uts46data). No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent). The report correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (accurate). No obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low). The only concern is external data trust, which is reasonable.\n- **Comments:** The report is thorough and aligns with the code's purpose. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard IDNA processing, Unicode normalization, and UTS46 remapping. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (appropriate). No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct). No obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low). The report emphasizes the standard nature of the code.\n- **Comments:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard IDNA implementation with validation, normalization, and remapping. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (appropriate). No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low). Based on reliance on external data, which is typical.\n- **Comments:** Well-aligned with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard validation and processing routines.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (minimal). No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a legitimate IDNA processing module, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, justified by reliance on external data modules, which is standard.\n- **Comments:** Consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), justified by reliance on external data, which is standard for IDNA implementations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — due to external data dependencies, but overall low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and behavior. No modifications necessary.",
