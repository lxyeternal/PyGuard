  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of IDNA processing routines, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The external dependencies are typical for this domain and do not introduce malicious risks. The overall security posture is high, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting external data trust. The code is safe for use in supply chain contexts."
