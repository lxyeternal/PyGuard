{
  "purpose": "The code implements IDNA encoding and validation functions, including Unicode normalization, bidirectional, contextual, hyphen, and length checks, relying on external Unicode data modules.",
  "sources": "Reads input domain strings, external modules (idnadata, intranges, uts46data) for Unicode properties and mappings.",
  "sinks": "Processes and validates domain labels; raises exceptions on invalid input; no network or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input domain string -> normalization and remapping -> label validation functions -> exception or processed output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy reliance on external data modules; no obfuscation or malicious code detected; no suspicious logic or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard IDNA processing with comprehensive Unicode validation, normalization, and contextual checks. External modules are trusted sources for Unicode data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The logic is straightforward, with exception handling for invalid labels. The external data reliance is typical for such implementations but warrants trust in those modules. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of IDNA processing routines, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The external dependencies are typical for this domain and do not introduce malicious risks. The overall security posture is high, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting external data trust. The code is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
