  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles IDNA encoding/validation, relies on external modules (`idnadata`, `intranges`, `uts46data`).\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, standard Unicode validation, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Secure, standard implementation; high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's structure. No issues found. The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the domain validation context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar IDNA processing, external data reliance.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, standard validation, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-implemented, low risk, high confidence (0.9). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate. No suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard IDNA encoding/decoding, validation.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard, safe implementation; high confidence (0.95). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** IDNA processing, normalization, UTS46 remapping.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, standard Unicode normalization, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate implementation, low risk, high confidence (0.95). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** IDNA functions, external Unicode data modules.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, standard validation, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard implementation; high confidence (0.9). Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code's purpose. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None identified across all reports.\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, aligning with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential reliance on external data modules, but overall low.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of IDNA processing, including Unicode normalization, bidirectional, contextual, hyphen, and length checks.\n- External data modules (`idnadata`, `intranges`, `uts46data`) are typical for such implementations; no signs of malicious manipulation.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration observed.\n- The validation steps and exception handling are appropriate and thorough.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — considering external data reliance, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears secure and legitimate for its purpose.",
