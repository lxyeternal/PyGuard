{
  "purpose": "This code provides data structures defining Unicode codepoint ranges and properties for use in Unicode normalization, character classification, and script handling within the idna data processing module.",
  "sources": "Data structures such as 'scripts', 'joining_types', 'codepoint_classes' are populated with Unicode codepoints and ranges; no external input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not perform any data output, network operations, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is present; the data structures are static and predefined, used internally for Unicode processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. The data appears to be static Unicode codepoint ranges and properties, typical for a Unicode database module.",
  "analysis": "The entire code comprises static definitions: dictionaries and tuples mapping scripts, joining types, and character classes to specific Unicode codepoints or ranges. No functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The code serves as a data repository for Unicode properties necessary for IDNA processing. The structure and content are consistent with standard Unicode data modules and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static data structure used to classify Unicode codepoints for use in IDNA and Unicode handling. It contains no executable or network-related code and appears to be a legitimate part of Unicode and IDNA data processing. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected.",
