{
  "purpose": "Static data module defining Unicode code point ranges, properties, and classifications used for IDNA processing and Unicode handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded tuples and dictionaries containing Unicode code points, ranges, and property mappings.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; purely static data used internally for Unicode property lookups.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static definitions into lookup functions within the Unicode processing library; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads; data appears consistent with Unicode standards and generated for IDNA purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data structures with Unicode code points, ranges, and property classifications. No functions, no input/output handling, and no dynamic code execution. The data is extensive but generated and standard for Unicode property files. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code's purpose is to facilitate Unicode and IDNA processing, which is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal, approximately 0.1, reflecting the static data nature but acknowledging the low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, generated Unicode property data module used for IDNA and Unicode processing. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
