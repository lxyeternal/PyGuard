  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions. No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious activity is detected.  \n   **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the minimal nature of the code and its lack of security issues. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is a simple version string assignment with no external inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious behavior, a high risk score is unwarranted. The current score of 0 or 0.5 (not explicitly stated but implied) is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All claims are based on the observable minimal code snippet, with no assumptions about hidden behavior. The assessments are justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I concur with the existing assessments. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk is present.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and is justified based on the code's content.",
