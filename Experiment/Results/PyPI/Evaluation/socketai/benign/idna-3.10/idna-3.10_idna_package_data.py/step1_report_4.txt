  "purpose": "This code defines the version of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to the variable '__version__' at the top level of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external calls.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply assigns a version string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard version declaration statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment setting '__version__' to '3.10'. There are no input/output operations, no function calls, no dynamic code execution, or external interactions. It appears to be a typical version string declaration for a Python package or module. Since the code is minimal and straightforward, there is no indication of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
