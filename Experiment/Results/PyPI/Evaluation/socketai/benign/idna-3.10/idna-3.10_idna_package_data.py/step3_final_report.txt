  "purpose": "Assigns the version number of the package; serves as metadata.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic that could be exploited. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code's simplicity and standard pattern confirm its benign nature. Scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate, with confidence level 1.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring aligns with the code's simplicity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
