  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string value to the variable __version__, which is a common practice for versioning in Python modules. No external input, no data processing, no malicious or unusual behavior present. The minimal content reduces the likelihood of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
