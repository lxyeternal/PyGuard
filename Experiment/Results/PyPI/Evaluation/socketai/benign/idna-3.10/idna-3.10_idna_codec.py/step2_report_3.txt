  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code with the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation of an IDNA2008 codec, supporting incremental and stream processing.\n- It uses external functions (`alabel`, `ulabel`, `encode`, `decode`) assumed to perform standard label transformations.\n- No network, file, or external system interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code registers itself under the name `'idna2008'`.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard implementation, high confidence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The report correctly notes the use of external functions, regex for Unicode dots, and proper error handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- The logic aligns with the code.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:** Standard IDNA implementation, no malicious activity, high confidence.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, the report correctly identifies the code's behavior.\n- No network activity or malicious patterns.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but justified.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0.2 — perhaps slightly conservative; the code is quite benign, but minimal risk could be considered due to potential misuse of domain labels, but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:** Same as above, standard IDNA codec, no malicious activity.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Consistent with the previous assessments.\n- No suspicious code or behavior.\n- The confidence is 1, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:** Standard implementation, no malicious activity, very similar to previous.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk is 0.1, perhaps slightly conservative, but acceptable.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:** Standard, straightforward IDNA2008 codec, no malicious activity.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.\n- Confidence is 0.9, which seems justified given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- The external functions (`alabel`, `ulabel`, `encode`, `decode`) are assumed to be standard and safe.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, **0** or very close to zero.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an IDNA2008 codec with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and do not require adjustment.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed.",
