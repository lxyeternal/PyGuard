  "purpose": "Implementation of an IDNA2008 codec for encoding and decoding internationalized domain names, supporting incremental and stream processing.",
  "sources": "Input data for encode/decode methods, external functions alabel, ulabel, encode, decode, regex for Unicode dots splitting labels.",
  "sinks": "Processed labels passed to external functions, resulting in encoded/decoded domain name strings or bytes.",
  "flows": "Input data -> regex split into labels -> label processing functions (alabel/ulabel) -> join with '.' -> output encoded/decoded string or bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard regex, no suspicious patterns, no external network or file I/O, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of an IDNA2008 codec, relying on external functions presumed to be safe. It handles errors properly, registers itself correctly, and performs label processing without suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious code, or external system interactions are present. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible. External functions are assumed safe; no logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an IDNA2008 codec with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the overall risk is very low. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
