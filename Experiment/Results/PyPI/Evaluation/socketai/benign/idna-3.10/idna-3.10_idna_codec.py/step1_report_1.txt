{
  "purpose": "Implement a codec for IDNA2008 (Internationalized Domain Names) encoding and decoding, supporting incremental and stream processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data for encoding/decoding from parameters of functions such as encode, decode, _buffer_encode, and _buffer_decode.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks found; the code processes data internally without sending data to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through encoding/decoding functions, split into labels, and converted using alabel/ulabel functions, then reconstructed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The regular expression and processing appear standard for domain name normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard codec implementation for IDNA2008, with proper handling of input, errors, and incremental processing. It uses external functions (alabel, ulabel, encode, decode) assumed to perform expected transformations. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code registers the codec under 'idna2008' name. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior, and it appears to be a legitimate implementation for domain name processing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign implementation of an IDNA2008 codec with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It adheres to expected patterns for such a module.",
