{
  "purpose": "Convert a list of integers into a compact range representation and perform efficient containment queries using binary search on encoded ranges.",
  "sources": "The list of integers is sorted and processed to identify consecutive runs; ranges are encoded as 64-bit integers with start and end points.",
  "sinks": "The containment check uses binary search on the encoded range tuple to determine if an integer falls within any range.",
  "flows": "Input list -> sorted list -> identify consecutive runs -> encode ranges -> store in tuple -> containment query via binary search -> decode range for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward implementation with standard libraries and bitwise operations.",
  "analysis": "The code sorts the input list, merges consecutive integers into ranges, encodes each range as a 64-bit integer, and performs containment checks using binary search. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external data leaks are present. The logic is clear, efficient, and standard for range compression and querying. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's simplicity and correctness justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score, approximately 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, efficient utility for range encoding and membership testing, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are consistent with this assessment, and the scores assigned are appropriate.",
