{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for encoding and decoding labels, and a placeholder for nameprep processing, likely part of a domain name processing library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'label' (str, bytes, or bytearray), and 's' (Any type).",
  "sinks": "The encode and decode functions imported from '.core' are potential sinks if they process untrusted data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to encode/decode functions; no other data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "The nameprep function raises NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete implementation; no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: ToASCII calls encode on a string, and ToUnicode calls decode on bytes or bytearray. The 'nameprep' function is a stub raising an exception, suggesting incomplete or placeholder implementation. Since encode and decode are imported from a local module, their security depends on their implementation. No untrusted data handling, external calls with user input, or malicious constructs are present. The structure is straightforward, with no anomalies like obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple utility code with no malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger library for processing domain name labels. The placeholder for 'nameprep' suggests incomplete functionality but not malicious intent. No security risks are evident in this fragment.",
