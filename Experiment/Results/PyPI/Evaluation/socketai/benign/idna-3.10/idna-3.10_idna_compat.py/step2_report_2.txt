  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scores assigned, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions `ToASCII` and `ToUnicode` that wrap `encode` and `decode` functions imported from `.core`.\n- Contains a `nameprep` function that raises `NotImplementedError`, indicating it's a placeholder.\n- No evident malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The functions are straightforward wrappers, and the core encoding/decoding logic's security depends on the imported functions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code matches the description in all reports; no issues or anomalies are present beyond the unimplemented `nameprep`.\n- No data leaks, no suspicious data handling, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The `nameprep` function raises `NotImplementedError`, which could be considered incomplete but not malicious.\n- The reliance on external `encode` and `decode` functions means security depends on their implementation, but this is outside the scope of the provided code.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which seems reasonable.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are around 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, which is consistent with the benign analysis.\n- The `confidence` scores are high (0.9), which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected, a `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n- The `securityRisk` score of 0.1 is acceptable, considering the incomplete `nameprep` implementation and reliance on external functions, but nothing dangerous is indicated.\n- The placeholder `nameprep` raises no red flags; it's a known placeholder for unimplemented features.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only point of concern is the unimplemented `nameprep`. If this code is used in production, missing this feature could lead to incorrect handling of internationalized domain names, but this is a functional concern, not a security one.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, due to incomplete implementation but no security threat)\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security issues. The placeholder `nameprep` function indicates incomplete implementation but does not introduce vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores for malware and obfuscation. Consider marking `securityRisk` slightly higher if the incomplete `nameprep` is critical in the deployment context, but as per the provided data, 0.1 remains appropriate.",
