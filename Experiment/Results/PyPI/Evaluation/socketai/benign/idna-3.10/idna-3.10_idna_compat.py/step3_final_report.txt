  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding domain labels, with a placeholder for name preparation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'label' in ToASCII and ToUnicode functions; external encode/decode functions imported from .core.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed into sensitive sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input label -> encode/decode functions -> output; no complex source-to-sink flows; nameprep raises exception if called.",
  "anomalies": "The nameprep function raises NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete implementation but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward wrappers around external encode/decode functions, with a placeholder nameprep. No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The security depends on the external functions, but the wrapper itself is benign. The nameprep function's exception is a normal placeholder. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are consistent with minimal, non-malicious utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility wrapper with an unimplemented placeholder. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The existing scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
