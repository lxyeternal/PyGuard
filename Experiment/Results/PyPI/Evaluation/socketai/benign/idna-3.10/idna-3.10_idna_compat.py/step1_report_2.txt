  "purpose": "Provides functions for encoding and decoding domain name labels, and a placeholder for nameprep functionality.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to ToASCII (label: str), ToUnicode (label: bytes or bytearray), and the argument to nameprep (s: Any).",
  "sinks": "encode() and decode() functions may process data; however, without implementation details, their behavior is unknown.",
  "flows": "Input data from label parameters flow into encode() and decode() functions; nameprep raises NotImplementedError, no data flow occurs there.",
  "anomalies": "The nameprep function raises NotImplementedError explicitly, which is normal for unimplemented features; no suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions for encoding and decoding operations, relying on external functions 'encode' and 'decode'. The nameprep function intentionally raises an exception, indicating the feature is not supported or implemented. There are no hardcoded secrets, input validation, or suspicious operations. The imported modules and functions seem standard for handling string encoding conversions. Without implementation details of 'encode' and 'decode', the overall security impact cannot be fully determined, but nothing suspicious is evident within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions for encoding/decoding domain labels with no malicious intent. The explicit NotImplementedError in nameprep is normal and not suspicious. No security risks or malware indications are present based on this fragment.",
