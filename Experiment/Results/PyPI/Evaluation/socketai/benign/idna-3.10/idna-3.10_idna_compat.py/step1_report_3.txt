{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding and decoding labels, likely for domain name processing, and a placeholder function for nameprep which raises an error.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read input from untrusted sources directly; they operate on input parameters passed to them.",
  "sinks": "The functions return encoded or decoded data, but do not directly output or transmit data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to encode or decode functions and their results are returned; no external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "The 'nameprep' function intentionally raises NotImplementedError, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code relies on external 'decode' and 'encode' functions, but their implementations are not shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple wrapper functions around external encode/decode methods and a placeholder function that raises an error. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present. The code appears to serve domain name or text processing purposes, with no dangerous data handling or insecure operations detected. The raise in 'nameprep' may indicate incomplete implementation but does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malware or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger library for text or domain name handling, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident in this fragment.",
