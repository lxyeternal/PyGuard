  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding labels, likely related to IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names).",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'label' for ToASCII and ToUnicode functions, and 's' in nameprep (though unused).",
  "sinks": "The encode() and decode() functions called within ToASCII and ToUnicode, which process label data.",
  "flows": "Input label data flows into encode() and decode() functions, which then output encoded or decoded strings/bytes.",
  "anomalies": "The nameprep function raises NotImplementedError and does not perform any processing or sanitization; this is unusual and may indicate incomplete implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple wrapper functions for encoding and decoding labels. It imports 'decode' and 'encode' from a local module '.core'. The functions themselves are straightforward and do not perform any unsafe operations. The nameprep function explicitly raises an error, indicating that it is not implemented, which could be a placeholder. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity. The code appears to be part of a larger library for IDNA handling but on its own, it does not show malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, providing simple wrappers for encoding/decoding with a placeholder for nameprep. No malicious behavior is evident. The incomplete nameprep implementation suggests ongoing development rather than malicious sabotage.",
