{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for encoding and decoding labels, likely for handling IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names). It also includes a placeholder function for nameprep, which is not implemented.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'label' parameter in ToASCII and ToUnicode functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input from 'label' flows into encode/decode functions, which are imported from another module; no further processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "The nameprep function raises NotImplementedError; no suspicious or unusual code present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and straightforward, providing encoding/decoding wrappers. The encode and decode functions are imported from a core module, but their implementation isn't shown, so potential risks depend on that. The placeholder nameprep function explicitly states non-utilization of IDNA nameprep protocol, which is not suspicious. No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a utility wrapper around encoding/decoding functions. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
