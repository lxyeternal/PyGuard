  "purpose": "Unit tests for the idna.codec module, verifying encoding, decoding, stream handling, and incremental processing.",
  "sources": "Test data from the external test_idna module, controlled within the test environment.",
  "sinks": "Standard encoding/decoding functions within the codecs library.",
  "flows": "Data flows within the controlled test data through encoding and decoding functions, including stream-based processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code uses standard libraries and testing patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit testing suite for the idna.codec module, focusing on encoding, decoding, stream handling, and incremental processing. It employs standard Python libraries and controlled test data, with no external untrusted inputs or malicious code. The tests are comprehensive for the module's functionality but do not process untrusted data or perform network operations. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and purpose are transparent and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit testing suite for the idna.codec module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
