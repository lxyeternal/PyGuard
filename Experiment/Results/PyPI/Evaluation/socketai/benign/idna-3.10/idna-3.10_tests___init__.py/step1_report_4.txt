  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear from the snippet provided. It appears to be a simple Python script that imports modules and performs basic operations, but without additional context or functionality, its intent is ambiguous.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and any input sources if present, but specific data input points are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data transmissions are evident in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Without concrete functions or data manipulation, there are no identifiable data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be standard boilerplate or a minimal script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and performs minimal operations. No network, file, or environment interactions are visible. Absence of dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic reduces concern. Due to the limited snippet, comprehensive analysis is constrained. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in nature.",
