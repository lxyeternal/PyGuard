  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially sensitive functions such as eval(), exec(), network communication points, and data input points.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into functions like eval(), exec(), network connections, or file operations that could leak data or execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "Sources like untrusted input or code patterns flow into sinks such as eval(), exec(), or network functions, indicating potential risk if untrusted data is processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() without context, moderate obfuscation scores, and suspicion of dynamic code execution; no concrete malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate no definitive malicious activity across all reports. Most reports show no obfuscation or malware, with low to moderate security risk scores. Report 3 mentions suspicious patterns like eval()/exec() and moderate obfuscation, justifying slightly higher suspicion but lacking concrete evidence. Confidence levels are moderate to high, aligning with cautious assessments. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, with minor room for adjustment if actual code confirms suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Slight suspicion in Report 3 warrants a marginally increased obfuscation score but not high malware risk. The security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting cautious but low threat levels. No significant adjustments are necessary; scores are consistent with the provided analysis.",
