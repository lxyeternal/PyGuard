  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Slight suspicion in Report 3 warrants a marginally increased obfuscation score but not high malware risk. The security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting cautious but low threat levels. No significant adjustments are necessary; scores are consistent with the provided analysis."
