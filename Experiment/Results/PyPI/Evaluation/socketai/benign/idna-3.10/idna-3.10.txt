      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of IDNA processing routines, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The external dependencies are typical for this domain and do not introduce malicious risks. The overall security posture is high, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting external data trust. The code is safe for use in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Slight suspicion in Report 3 warrants a marginally increased obfuscation score but not high malware risk. The security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting cautious but low threat levels. No significant adjustments are necessary; scores are consistent with the provided analysis."
