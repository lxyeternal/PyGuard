  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS MediaLive SDK, providing static typing support for paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Calls to client.get_paginator() with specific operation names, and the use of **kwargs in paginate methods for API parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, no network or file operations, only class and method signatures for static typing.",
  "flows": "Calling get_paginator() to obtain paginator objects, then calling paginate() with optional parameters; no data processing or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated set of type stub classes for boto3 paginators, providing static type annotations for various AWS MediaLive API operations. It uses typical patterns like class inheritance, method signatures with Unpack for kwargs, and documentation links. There are no suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no runtime logic. The use of kwargs in paginate is standard for API parameter passing and does not introduce security risks. The code is purely structural, serving as a static type layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for static type support, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard pattern for boto3 type stubs, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.",
