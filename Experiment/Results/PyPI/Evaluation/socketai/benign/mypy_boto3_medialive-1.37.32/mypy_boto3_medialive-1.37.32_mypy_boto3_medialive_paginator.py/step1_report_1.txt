{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginators for AWS MediaLive service client, facilitating paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of paginator configurations and request parameters, and imports from external modules such as 'sys', 'typing', 'botocore.paginate', and local type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The code defines class methods that invoke 'paginate' with dynamic keyword arguments unpacked from provided types; no dangerous sinks like network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling 'client.get_paginator' with a string, then calling 'paginate' with unpacked request parameters, resulting in page iteration over responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code strictly consists of class definitions, type annotations, and method signatures. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up typed paginators for AWS MediaLive responses, with clear class hierarchies and type checking, following standard patterns. It uses conditional type definitions to support different Python versions. There are no code injection points, network operations, or external commands. The import statements are safe, and the code structure is typical for type stub definitions. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is clearly for type safety and pagination support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type annotations and class wrappers for AWS MediaLive paginators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a type-safe interface for paginated API responses and contains no harmful or suspicious logic.",
