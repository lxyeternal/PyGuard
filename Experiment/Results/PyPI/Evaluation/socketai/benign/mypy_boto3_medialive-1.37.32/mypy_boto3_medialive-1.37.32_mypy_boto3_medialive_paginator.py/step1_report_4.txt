{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS MediaLive service, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated API responses in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definition modules (type_defs), system version info (sys.version_info), and imports from botocore and typing_extensions. It does not process external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network requests, or data leaks. It primarily defines classes and methods for paginating AWS API responses with no data sink involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code sets up class inheritance and type annotations for paginators, with methods like 'paginate' receiving **kwargs with specific types. There are no dynamic execution, data manipulation, or untrusted data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or hardcoded secrets, are present. The code strictly adheres to standard type annotation and class definitions for a client library.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of paginators for AWS MediaLive API, including detailed type annotations for responses and requests. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, defines paginator classes with 'paginate' methods, and does not contain any network, file, or system command executions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, purely for type safety and interface definition, with no malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured type annotation and class setup for AWS SDK paginators, with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected. It functions solely as an interface layer for safe API response iteration.",
