  "purpose": "Define paginators for AWS MediaLive service client with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports of system modules, third-party libraries (botocore, typing, typing_extensions), and local type definitions; reading of __future__ annotations for forward references.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external network interactions present in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code consists of class definitions and method signatures without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive type definitions and docstrings; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes for AWS MediaLive SDK, with detailed type annotations and documentation links. The classes inherit from a generic Paginator base, with no runtime logic or external calls beyond standard boto3 pattern. No input/output flows indicate potential security risks. The code appears to be a well-structured type stub layer, facilitating static analysis and IDE support. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type definition module for AWS boto3 paginators, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It serves as an interface layer with extensive type hints and documentation references, providing no security threats.",
