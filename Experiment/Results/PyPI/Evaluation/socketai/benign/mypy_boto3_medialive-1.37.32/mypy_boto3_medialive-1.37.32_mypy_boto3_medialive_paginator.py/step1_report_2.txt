{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for AWS MediaLive service client paginators to facilitate type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; type annotations within class methods and global class declarations.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted input handling or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and class methods define source-to-sink flow; paginate methods accept kwargs and return PageIterator objects, but do not process untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily auto-generated boilerplate for boto3 paginator type definitions. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides structured paginator classes with type annotations, following standard boto3 and mypy conventions. The classes extend from Paginator, parameterized with response types. The paginate methods correctly accept kwargs with specific type hints and return PageIterator objects. No network, file, or data exfiltration operations are present. No hardcoded credentials or potentially malicious logic are detected. The code is purely structural and for type safety, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated type-safe interface for AWS MediaLive paginators, with no signs of malware or security risks. It strictly defines classes and methods for paginating API responses with proper type annotations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.",
