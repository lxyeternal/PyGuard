  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the module as an SDK interface for MediaLive, importing classes from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static setup.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual element is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future. This suggests a placeholder or misconfiguration but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly notes the code's static nature, absence of network calls, and lack of malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 (low, given the static, SDK-like nature).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The future date is noteworthy but not security-critical.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on the straightforward import/export structure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK wrapper, static, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—imports and exports, no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical SDK module, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on the module as an API wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Future copyright date (2025) again noted, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; static import/export.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the future date is a minor anomaly but not security relevant.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the module as facilitating resource management via AWS SDK classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Same future date noted; no other suspicious elements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK interface, static, and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Verification:** The code matches the descriptions—it's an SDK interface module with static imports, class aliases, and exports.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code. All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the static, SDK-like nature, the risk scores are appropriately low (around 0.1 or 0). The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date, which is not security-critical.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all analyses are consistent with the code's static, import/export pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, mainly due to the future date placeholder)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No further action is necessary.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, static SDK interface module with no security risks or malware. The minor anomaly (future date) does not impact security.",
