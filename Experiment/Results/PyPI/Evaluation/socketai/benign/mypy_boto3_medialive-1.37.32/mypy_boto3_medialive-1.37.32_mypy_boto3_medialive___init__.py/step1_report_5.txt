{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface for the MediaLive AWS service, providing access to client functionalities, waiters, and paginators for managing media live streams and related resources.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from module imports, class instantiations, and method calls to fetch waiters and paginators from the MediaLiveClient.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to pass untrusted data to sensitive sinks such as network connections, system commands, or file operations. It primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining variables that instantiate waiters and paginators via the MediaLiveClient, but it does not process external input or generate outputs based on external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The code is straightforward, mainly imports and variable definitions, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules related to AWS MediaLive service and assigns the client class to a variable. It defines a set of waiters and paginators used for asynchronous operations and list management within the service. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic. It appears to be a standard SDK wrapper or interface module for AWS service management, with no signs of backdoors, hidden data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK interface for AWS MediaLive, containing no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It only facilitates resource management through well-defined AWS SDK classes and functions. No security risks or malware are identified.",
