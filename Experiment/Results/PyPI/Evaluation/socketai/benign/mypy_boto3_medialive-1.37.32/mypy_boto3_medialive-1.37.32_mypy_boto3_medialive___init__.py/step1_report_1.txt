{
  "purpose": "This module provides a client interface and associated waiters and paginators for interacting with the AWS MediaLive service.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and the module's own code defining client and resource access points.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or external communications. It primarily defines class imports and assignments.",
  "flows": "The code establishes client and resource objects and their waiters/paginators, with no untrusted data flow or user input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward and primarily defines class imports and assignments. There is a copyright notice with a future date (2025), but it does not affect code security.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions from internal modules, then assigns the main client class to a variable and exposes all imported classes and functions via __all__. The structure suggests it is a standard SDK wrapper or interface module. No dynamic code execution, external URL requests, or data manipulations are present. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are identified. The code is static and appears to be an SDK interface, not containing malicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical SDK interface for AWS MediaLive, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform any network or file operations that could be malicious. The code is well-structured, static, and intended for SDK usage. Overall, it is safe.",
