  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the module as a client interface with waiters and paginators for AWS MediaLive, importing from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static setup, no runtime data processing, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** Future date (2025) in copyright, but this is likely a placeholder or oversight.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a static SDK wrapper, with no malicious logic, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 (very low), Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the static, non-executable nature of the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward imports and exports, no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with a standard SDK module, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the absence of runtime logic, data flow, or external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, straightforward SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Notes the future date (2025) in the copyright, but otherwise standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious implications, just a possible placeholder.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Describes the module as an interface for resource management, importing classes, defining waiters and paginators.\n- No external input or untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, SDK interface module.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright date (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static nature and absence of vulnerabilities, a score of **0** or very close to it is appropriate. The existing scores of 0.1 or 0 are reasonable.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard SDK interface with no security issues or malware risks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, static, and safe. No changes to scores are necessary.",
