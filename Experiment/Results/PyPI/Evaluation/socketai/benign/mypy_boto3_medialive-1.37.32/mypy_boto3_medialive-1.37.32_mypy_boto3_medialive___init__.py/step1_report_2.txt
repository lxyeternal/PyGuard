{
  "purpose": "This module provides an interface to the AWS MediaLive service, importing client, paginator, and waiter classes for managing media channels and related resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module files (.client, .paginator, .waiter), static class and function definitions, string literals for __all__ and documentation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no handling of user input.",
  "flows": "The code sets up class and function references, primarily static imports and assignments; no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, secrets, or tokens. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code. All code appears to be straightforward imports, class definitions, and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines imports from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and re-exports various classes and constants related to the AWS MediaLive service. There are no code execution paths, no network connections, no use of environment variables, nor handling of external input. It appears to be a standard API wrapper module, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The presence of copyright notice and documentation URL is typical. No anomalies, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface module for AWS MediaLive, consisting of imports and exports with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any runtime operations that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
