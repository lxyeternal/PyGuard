  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is an SDK interface importing classes, waiters, and paginators.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing, network calls, or untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The future date (2025) is noted but is likely a placeholder or a typo.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a static SDK wrapper, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, possibly reflecting the future date anomaly, but acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that it's a straightforward SDK interface with no dynamic or external data handling.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; no modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Again, confirms the code is a static import/export module with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Notes the future date (2025) in the copyright, which might be a placeholder or typo.\n- Otherwise, confirms the code is a benign wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Describes the code as a standard SDK interface, importing classes and defining waiters/paginators.\n- No external data, no code injection, no suspicious patterns.\n- The only notable point is the lack of runtime logic or data processing.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Risk: 0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is purely static, importing and exporting classes/functions related to AWS MediaLive SDK.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by the future date anomaly, but overall very low risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks; the only anomaly is the future date, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate; I would maintain them as-is, perhaps adjusting the risk score to 0 in all cases for clarity, but the current low value is acceptable.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Keep risk scores at 0 or 0.1 if emphasizing the future date anomaly, but it's not a security issue.\n\n**Overall assessment:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious content.",
