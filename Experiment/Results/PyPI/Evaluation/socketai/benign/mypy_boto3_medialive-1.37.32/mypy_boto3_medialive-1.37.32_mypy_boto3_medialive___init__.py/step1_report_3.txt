{
  "purpose": "Defines and exports classes and functions for interacting with AWS MediaLive service, including waiters, paginators, and client.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs identified. No code execution, data transmission, or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly declares imports and exports class references.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic present. The code appears to be standard module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements, class and function exports, and type aliasing. No runtime logic, data processing, or external communication is implemented. The structure aligns with typical SDK module patterns. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms are evident. The code is clean, straightforward, and typical for a service interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for AWS MediaLive SDK components, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly organizes imports and exports for usability. No malware or security issues identified.",
