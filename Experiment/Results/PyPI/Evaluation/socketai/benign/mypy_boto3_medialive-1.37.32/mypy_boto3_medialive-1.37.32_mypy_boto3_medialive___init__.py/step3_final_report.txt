{
  "purpose": "Static SDK interface for AWS MediaLive, importing waiters, paginators, and client classes for resource management and event handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: client, paginator, waiter classes; no runtime data input.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing; static setup only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; purely static class and function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder; no secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static SDK wrapper with no dynamic logic, network calls, or data processing. It imports classes and assigns them to module exports, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor anomaly is the future date, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. The future date is likely a placeholder and not a security concern.",
