{
  "purpose": "Provides type annotations and custom waiters for AWS MediaLive service client to facilitate waiting for specific resource states in a type-safe manner.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, botocore.waiter.Waiter, and various type definitions from local modules; no external or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network connections, file writes, or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines classes and method signatures for waiters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is solely for type annotations and class definitions. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a set of specialized waiter classes for AWS MediaLive, inheriting from botocore's Waiter. It conditionally imports Unpack for type annotations. No runtime behavior, external input handling, or malicious logic is present. The structure and content are consistent with standard SDK extension patterns, focusing on type safety and documentation links. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and class extension module for AWS waiters, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module for improving type safety and documentation clarity.",
