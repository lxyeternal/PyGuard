{
  "purpose": "Define custom waiters for the AWS MediaLive service using boto3, providing type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.waiter, type definitions from .type_defs, sys.version_info for compatibility, and the class method definitions with wait functions.",
  "sinks": "The wait methods call the parent class's wait function; no untrusted data or external input handling is present within the code itself.",
  "flows": "The class definitions inherit from Waiter and override the wait method, which calls the base implementation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is primarily boilerplate class definitions with docstrings and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of Waiter for specific AWS MediaLive wait conditions, with structured documentation links. No external input handling, data processing, or suspicious logic exists. The use of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard for compatibility. The wait methods are overridden but only call the parent class method without additional logic, indicating straightforward extension without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of class definitions for AWS MediaLive waiters, intended for type-annotated usage in a larger codebase. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as boilerplate extension of the boto3 Waiter class for specific AWS resource states.",
