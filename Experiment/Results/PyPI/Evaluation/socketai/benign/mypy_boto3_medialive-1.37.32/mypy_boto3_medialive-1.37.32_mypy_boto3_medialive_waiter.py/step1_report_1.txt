{
  "purpose": "Provides type annotations and custom waiter classes for MediaLive service in boto3, facilitating asynchronous resource state waiting.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, botocore, and local type_defs module; class method parameters utilizing imported type defs.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted input, network operations, or data leaks within this code.",
  "flows": "Class methods call the parent 'wait' method with unpacked kwargs; no untrusted data flow or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and structured for type annotations and waiters. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom waiter classes inheriting from botocore's Waiter, with each class providing a wait method documented with links to boto3 and stub documentation. All classes and methods are static and do not process or handle untrusted inputs, execute external commands, or perform network operations. The imported modules are standard and from local type definitions. No obfuscated or malicious code features detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and custom waiter classes for boto3's MediaLive client. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a type-safe extension for waiting on AWS MediaLive resources.",
