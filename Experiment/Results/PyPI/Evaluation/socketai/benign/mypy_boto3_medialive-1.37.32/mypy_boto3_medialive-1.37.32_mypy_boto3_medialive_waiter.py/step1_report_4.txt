{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom waiter classes for the AWS MediaLive service, providing typed interfaces for waiting on specific resource states.",
  "sources": "The code imports data types from type_defs and sys, and reads no external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sink points are present; the code does not perform network operations, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The waiter classes define wait methods that invoke the parent Waiter class with specific typed kwargs, but no actual logic or external data flow is implemented here.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely structural, defining subclasses with no executable logic or data handling, and no suspicious operations or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines waiter subclasses with type annotations and documentation links, adhering to standard class inheritance and method signatures. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data manipulation occurs within this fragment. The imports are for type definitions and standard library modules, with no apparent malicious activity. The overall structure indicates a standard SDK extension for typed waiters, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of custom waiter classes with type annotations. It does not contain malicious code or security risks. The purpose is purely to facilitate type-safe API calls, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
