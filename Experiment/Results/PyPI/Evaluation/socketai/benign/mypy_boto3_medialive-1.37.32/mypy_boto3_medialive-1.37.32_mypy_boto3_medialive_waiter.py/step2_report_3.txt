  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the actual security implications based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code provides type annotations and custom waiter classes for MediaLive, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely class definitions extending botocore's Waiter, with no runtime logic beyond method signatures. No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Risk Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. This aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety and documentation links. No external input or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static class definitions for type annotations. No dynamic or unsafe operations.\n- **Risk Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.9 seems slightly high but can be justified as a conservative measure, though the code itself is benign.\n- **Note:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.9, which appears excessive given the benign nature. A score of 0.1 would be more appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the high security risk score is unjustified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines subclasses with detailed documentation, no external data handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely structural, with no runtime or external effects.\n- **Risk Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. This is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the structural and benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic behavior, no external input, no code execution.\n- **Risk Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. All consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is boilerplate class extension with no suspicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** All indications point to safe, static class definitions.\n- **Risk Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, malware, or obfuscation. I agree with a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation detected. I agree with 0.\n- **Risk Score:** The only concern is Report 2, which assigns a high security risk (0.9). Given the code's static, benign nature, a risk score of **0.0 to 0.1** is more appropriate.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of class definitions for AWS MediaLive waiters, serving as type-safe extensions with no malicious or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (for conservative caution, but practically 0)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
