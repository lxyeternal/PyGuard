  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the presence of issues, logical soundness, and appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** The report states that the code provides type annotations and custom waiter classes for MediaLive, with no untrusted input, network activity, or data leaks. It emphasizes that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious features.\n\n- **Issue Confirmation:** The code defines subclasses of `botocore.waiter.Waiter`, with each class providing a `wait()` method documented with links. No runtime logic or data processing is present.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report is accurate. The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (since no issues). The report's score aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety, documentation, and lack of external or untrusted data handling.\n\n- **Issue Confirmation:** The code is a set of class definitions for waiters, with no dynamic or external operations.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The report's low risk score is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** The report notes the classes define waiters with type annotations, no external input, and no malicious behavior. It assigns a slightly higher security risk score (0.1), perhaps considering the potential for misuse if misused, but still finds no actual malicious activity.\n\n- **Issue Confirmation:** The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic or external effects.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The assessment is correct; no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlighting the structural, non-malicious nature of the code, with documentation links and type annotations.\n\n- **Issue Confirmation:** The code is a straightforward extension of boto3's Waiter classes, with no dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1. The report's risk score of 0 is slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** The report confirms the code is boilerplate class definitions for AWS waiters, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Issue Confirmation:** The code is purely structural, with no external or untrusted data handling.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 or 0.1. The report's score of 0 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious code present. Malware = 0 across all.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** No obfuscation detected; all are 0.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, but generally very low (0 or 0.1). Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0.1 is acceptable for the possibility of misuse, but not indicative of actual security issues.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (very low, appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and custom waiter classes for AWS MediaLive, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Recommended final scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal potential for misuse, but no actual security concern)",
