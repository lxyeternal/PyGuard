  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided details.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code provides type annotations and custom waiter classes for MediaLive, with no suspicious activity, external effects, or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward class definitions inheriting from botocore's Waiter, with no runtime logic beyond calling the parent wait method. The imports are standard, and no untrusted input or external commands are executed.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion that there's no malware or security risk is consistent with the code. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety, documentation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely structural, defining subclasses with type annotations, no dynamic code, network calls, or data leaks.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. Scores are reasonable, with malware=0 and risk=0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code defining typed interfaces for waiting on AWS MediaLive resources, with no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code only defines subclasses and wait methods that invoke the parent class, with no runtime logic or external effects.\n- **Justification for scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (a very low, negligible security risk due to the structural nature). The security risk score is slightly above zero but still minimal, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code. The slight security risk score might be a conservative acknowledgment that, as a utility module, it could be misused if integrated into malicious code, but on its own, it's benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom waiter classes for AWS MediaLive, with no data processing or external effects.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely structural, inheriting from Waiter, with no dynamic logic or external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on class inheritance, type annotations, and documentation.\n- **Assessment:** No runtime logic beyond calling the parent wait method; no external input or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is a standard extension of boto3's waiters with type annotations.\n- **Malicious activity or malware:** None detected. All reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low or zero, reflecting the benign, structural nature of the code.\n- **Consistency:** The scores and conclusions are consistent across reports and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to zero, e.g., 0.0 or 0.1, as in Report 3, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is purely for type annotations and class definitions, with no runtime logic, external communication, or data handling that could pose security risks. It is a standard, benign extension for AWS SDK usage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action required.",
