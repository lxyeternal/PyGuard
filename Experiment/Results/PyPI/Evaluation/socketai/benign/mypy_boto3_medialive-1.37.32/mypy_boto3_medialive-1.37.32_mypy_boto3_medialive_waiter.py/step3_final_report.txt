  "purpose": "Type annotations and custom waiter classes for AWS MediaLive service client, facilitating wait operations with clear documentation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from botocore.waiter.Waiter, type annotations, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external commands, or runtime data processing; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance from Waiter, method signatures with type annotations, no data flow or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of botocore's Waiter with type annotations and documentation. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or network activity. The classes serve as type-safe extensions for AWS MediaLive waiters, with documentation links for reference. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external effects are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module providing type annotations and class definitions for AWS MediaLive waiters. It poses no security risks, contains no malware or obfuscation, and is purely structural. The risk scores should be 0 or very close to zero, with no concerns for malicious activity.",
