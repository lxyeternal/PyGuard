  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and risk assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and custom waiter classes for MediaLive, with no signs of malicious activity. It notes that the code is static, only providing class definitions and documentation links, with no external effects or untrusted input handling.\n\n- **Evaluation:** This is consistent with the code. The classes inherit from botocore's Waiter, define wait methods with type annotations, and contain no runtime logic beyond calling the superclass. The report's conclusion that there is no malware or security risk is accurate.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is for type safety, with no external or untrusted input, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. It recognizes the code as a standard extension for AWS waiters.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely structural, with no malicious features. The high confidence score (0.9) is justified.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report notes the code's purpose for defining typed waiter classes, with no external input or malicious activity. It mentions the code's focus on static structure, documentation links, and lack of dynamic behavior.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis is consistent. The security risk score is slightly 0.1, possibly considering the potential for misinterpretation or misuse, but given the code's static nature, this is minimal.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes that the code is purely structural, with no data processing, external input, or suspicious operations. It recognizes the class inheritance and documentation links as standard.\n\n- **Evaluation:** Accurate. The code is benign, serving as a type-safe extension. The confidence score is high, and malware/security risk scores are zero.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report describes the code as boilerplate class definitions for AWS waiters, with no malicious logic, external input, or obfuscation. It notes the use of sys.version_info for compatibility, which is standard.\n\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is correct. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated features.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is transparent and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the static, structural nature of the code.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of class definitions for AWS MediaLive waiters, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n- **My own estimate:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign utility module for type safety and documentation, with no security concerns.",
