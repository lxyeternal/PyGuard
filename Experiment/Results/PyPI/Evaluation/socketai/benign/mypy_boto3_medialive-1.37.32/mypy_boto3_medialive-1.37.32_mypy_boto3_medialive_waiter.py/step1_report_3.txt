{
  "purpose": "Defines custom waiter classes for the AWS MediaLive service, providing type annotations and documentation links for waiting on specific resource states.",
  "sources": "Constant string identifiers passed to 'client.get_waiter()' method; type definitions imported from '.type_defs' module; method parameters unpacked from predefined type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The wait() methods do not process untrusted input or execute system commands; they only invoke the superclass method with predefined parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily sets up class definitions and method signatures for waiting on AWS resource states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. All imported modules and class definitions appear to serve legitimate type annotation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of the 'Waiter' class for various AWS MediaLive resource states, with each class containing a wait() method that accepts parameters unpacked from specific type definitions. The class structures include detailed docstrings linking to AWS and boto3-stubs documentation, indicating an emphasis on type safety and clarity. The imported type definitions are likely used for static type checking and do not involve runtime dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, secret leakage, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type-annotated implementation intended for improved developer experience.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, non-malicious set of class definitions for AWS MediaLive waiters, providing type safety and documentation. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is solely for structuring wait operations with static type annotations, with no indications of security risks.",
