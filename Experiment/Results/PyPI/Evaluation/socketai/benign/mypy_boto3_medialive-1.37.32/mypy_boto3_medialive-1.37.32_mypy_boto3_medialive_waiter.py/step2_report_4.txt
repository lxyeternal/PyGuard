  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides type annotations and custom waiter classes for MediaLive, with no malicious behavior detected. The report notes the classes inherit from botocore's Waiter, with no untrusted input or external effects.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, justified by the code's static, non-executing nature.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely structural, focused on type safety and documentation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of runtime behavior, external input, or malicious logic. The code defines subclasses with detailed docstrings and type annotations.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, justified. No dynamic or external operations are present.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious features or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code defines static subclasses for waiters, with documentation links and type annotations. The report notes a security risk score of 0.1, citing \"securityRisk\" as 0.1.\n- **Justification of Risk:** The report suggests the score is high because of the documentation links and static class definitions, but emphasizes no actual logic or external data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** The assigned risk score of 0.1 appears slightly high given the absence of any runtime or external data processing. The code is purely structural, with no external effects or secrets. A risk score of 0.0 would be more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines subclasses with type annotations, no external input, no malicious activity, and standard class inheritance.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, serving as type-safe extensions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—boilerplate class definitions with documentation links, no external data handling, or malicious logic.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is purely structural, defining custom waiters inheriting from botocore's Waiter class, with type annotations and documentation links.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, except Report 3, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's nature, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be 0.0 for all reports, as the code does not perform any runtime operations, external communication, or data handling that could pose security risks.\n- **Confidence:** High, as the code is straightforward and well-documented.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured extension for type safety in AWS MediaLive waiters, with no security concerns.",
