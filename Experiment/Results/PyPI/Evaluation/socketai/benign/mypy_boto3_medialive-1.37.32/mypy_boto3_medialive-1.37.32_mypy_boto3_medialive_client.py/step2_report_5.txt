  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious indicators, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the given scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states an \"Empty response\" with no data, and notes that the code is a large, auto-generated SDK interface with no suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the code as purely SDK stub definitions, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code is a set of type annotations and SDK interface definitions, with no evidence of untrusted data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the static, stub-like nature.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as auto-generated SDK stubs intended for static type checking, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on the type annotations and method signatures, with no malicious behaviors observed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly concludes that the code is a standard SDK stub, with no malicious payloads.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes the code as providing type annotations and method signatures, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately characterizes the code as static SDK definitions, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—type annotations and interface definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the static, stub-like nature.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as purely for static analysis and documentation.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations, method signatures, overloads, and documentation links for the AWS MediaLive SDK, likely auto-generated.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None evident; the code is purely interface and type hinting definitions.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the nature of the code as SDK stub definitions intended for static type checking, with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling that could pose a security threat. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and auto-generated for type hints.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks detected.\n\nThis code is a benign, auto-generated SDK interface for AWS MediaLive, serving static type annotations and documentation support.",
