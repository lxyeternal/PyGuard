  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n- **Assessment:** The report indicates an \"Empty response\" with no further context. This is likely just a placeholder or an artifact from a monitoring tool. It does not suggest malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears to be a standard SDK stub with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and interface definitions for the SDK.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No untrusted data handling, no code execution, no external data processing.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a large, auto-generated stub providing static type hints for the boto3 MediaLive client. It contains no executable logic, network calls, or dynamic code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK stub for static type checking, with no malicious or security-compromising elements.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on method signatures and type hints.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, data leaks, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** This is a typical auto-generated SDK interface class. It only defines method signatures, overloads, and documentation links. No malicious behavior or backdoors are present.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of supply chain sabotage; the code is a benign SDK stub.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, providing type annotations and method signatures.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No dynamic or executable code, no external data handling.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely static type annotations for the boto3 client, serving IDE and static analysis tools. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard SDK stub, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on SDK interface.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No executable logic or data processing.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and method signatures for static type checking. No signs of sabotage or malware.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. The code is purely static SDK stub code, with no executable or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. No obfuscation, encryption, or hiding techniques are present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or below. The code is standard, auto-generated SDK interface code with no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a well-structured, auto-generated SDK stub for AWS MediaLive, primarily for static type checking and IDE support.\n- No runtime code, no external data handling, no network activity, no embedded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The extensive type annotations and overloads are typical for SDK stub files, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, as it's a stub for a legitimate SDK)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThere is no evidence of supply chain sabotage, malware, or malicious behavior in this code. It is a standard, auto-generated SDK interface meant for static analysis and type safety.",
