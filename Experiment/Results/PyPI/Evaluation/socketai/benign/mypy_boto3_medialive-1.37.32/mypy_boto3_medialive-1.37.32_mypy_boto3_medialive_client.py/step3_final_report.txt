{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS MediaLive SDK client, primarily for static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, overloads, and documentation links; no untrusted data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external data handling, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Static method signatures with overloads; no runtime data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of runtime logic, network calls, or dynamic code; extensive overloads are typical for SDK type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, auto-generated SDK stub for boto3's MediaLive client, containing only class definitions, method signatures, overloads, and documentation links. No executable logic, network activity, or data processing is present. The purpose is to facilitate static analysis, IDE autocompletion, and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK interface for static type checking, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a standard SDK stub, and scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified as zero.",
