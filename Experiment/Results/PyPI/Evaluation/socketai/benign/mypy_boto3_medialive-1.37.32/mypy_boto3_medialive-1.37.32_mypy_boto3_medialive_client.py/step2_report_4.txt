  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, data leaks, and logical flaws.\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All reports indicate that the code is a large, auto-generated SDK stub with detailed type annotations for the AWS MediaLive boto3 client.\n- They emphasize the absence of untrusted data handling, network activity, or executable logic.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The purpose appears solely to provide type safety, documentation, and IDE support.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and malware/security risk scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency\n\n- **Code Content:** The code consists exclusively of class definitions, method signatures, overloads, type annotations, and documentation links.\n- **Behavior:** No runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.\n- **Imports:** Standard and third-party SDK modules, plus local modules for types and paginators.\n- **Purpose:** To serve as static type hints and interface definitions for the boto3 SDK.\n\n### Potential Issues or Anomalies\n\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or network activity.\n- Overloads are typical for SDK typing, not suspicious.\n- The \"error\": \"Empty response\" report likely refers to a non-executable, stub file with no runtime behavior.\n\n### Scores and Justification\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, justified because no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward and auto-generated SDK stub.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since there's no indication of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is purely for type annotations and SDK interface support.\n- They do not assume malicious intent without evidence, which is appropriate.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk (Supply Chain/Security):** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, auto-generated SDK stub providing type annotations for AWS MediaLive client interactions. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The purpose is purely to facilitate static analysis and IDE support.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malware detected.  \n- No obfuscation present.  \n- No security risk or supply chain sabotage evident.\n\nPlease let me know if further deep-dive analysis into specific parts is needed.",
