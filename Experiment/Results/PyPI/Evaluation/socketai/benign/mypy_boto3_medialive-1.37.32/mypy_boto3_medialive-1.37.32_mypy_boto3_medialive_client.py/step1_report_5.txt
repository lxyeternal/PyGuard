  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for AWS MediaLive service, providing method signatures and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and method definitions, and overloads for paginators and waiters.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations are only signatures; no actual data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicating data flow from input parameters (mostly type definitions) to return types; no runtime logic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code consists solely of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation references.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and method signatures for the MediaLive client, including overloads for paginators and waiters. It is designed for static type checking and does not contain executable logic or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are observed. The structure is consistent with auto-generated stubs for boto3 clients, with no embedded or hidden code. No suspicious imports or code that could be used for malicious purposes are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable set of type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS MediaLive service. It is purely for static type checking, documentation, and IDE support, and contains no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators.",
