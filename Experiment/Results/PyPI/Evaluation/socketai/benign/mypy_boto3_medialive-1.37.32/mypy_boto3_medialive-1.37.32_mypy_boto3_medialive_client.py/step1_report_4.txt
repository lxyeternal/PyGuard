{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS MediaLive service, providing method signatures for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions including properties, overloads, and API call wrappers.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No data output, network connections, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "Method calls and property accesses within the MediaLiveClient class, including paginator and waiter creation, and API operation wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. Extensive use of overloads for typing, typical for SDK stub classes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations, method signatures, and class structure for the AWS MediaLive client, leveraging type overloads for precise typing of paginators and waiters. No runtime code execution, no dynamic code eval, and no network or file operations are present. The structure is consistent with SDK stub implementation, and all imported modules serve standard purposes. There are no signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation and SDK interface definition for AWS MediaLive, with no malicious intent or behavior. It serves to improve type checking and IDE support. No security risks or malware detected.",
