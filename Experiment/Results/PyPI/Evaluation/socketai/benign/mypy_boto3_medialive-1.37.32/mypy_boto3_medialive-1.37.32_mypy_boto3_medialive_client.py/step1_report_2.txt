{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS MediaLive service, providing type hints and method signatures for interacting with the service via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; method definitions and overloads within MediaLiveClient class.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include input parameters to API calls, but no untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sources are directly processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Method calls take structured parameters; no untrusted data sources, direct data injection, or network interactions are performed within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code mainly defines type hints and method signatures for an SDK interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large, auto-generated-looking interface definition for the boto3 MediaLive client with detailed method signatures, overloads for paginators and waiters, and type annotations. It imports standard libraries, third-party SDK components, and local modules. There are no signs of code injection, hidden network connections, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or encryption is present. The purpose appears solely to provide type safety and documentation for legitimate AWS SDK interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, structured SDK interface with no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around AWS MediaLive service calls, with no signs of supply chain sabotage.",
