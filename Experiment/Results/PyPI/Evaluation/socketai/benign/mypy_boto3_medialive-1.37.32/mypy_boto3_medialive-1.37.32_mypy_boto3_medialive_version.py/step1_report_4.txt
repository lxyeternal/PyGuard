  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a version string assignment with a copyright comment. No input handling, no data processing, and no dynamic or executable code. The version number is hardcoded, which is common in package versioning. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard practice for version control in Python packages.",
