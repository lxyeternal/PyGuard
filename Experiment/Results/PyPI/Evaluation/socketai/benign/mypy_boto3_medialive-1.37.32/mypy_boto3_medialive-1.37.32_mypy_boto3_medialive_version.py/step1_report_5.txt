  "purpose": "Define and expose the package version information",

  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple assignment statement",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with an unusual year (2025) which may be a future date but not malicious, no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of a version string for the package, with a copyright comment. There are no external input reads, no data processing, and no suspicious code or behavior. The version is hardcoded, which is common for package metadata. The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define the version of the package. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
