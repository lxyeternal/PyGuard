  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.32\"\n```\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string.\n- No input/output, dynamic code, or external dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.\n- The only notable aspect is the future year (2025) in the copyright.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No significant errors. The reports are consistent, emphasizing the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores given (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk)?**  \n  All reports assign 0 to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code only assigns a static string to `__version__`, there's no malicious activity. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present. Score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  The code contains no dynamic or external interactions. The only unusual aspect is the future date (2025), but that is not inherently malicious or risky. Score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions about vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The future year (2025) is unusual but not malicious. It might be a typo or a future-dated copyright, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n- No code execution, no secrets, no external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security concerns)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a simple version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, standard for package versioning, and contains no suspicious elements.",
