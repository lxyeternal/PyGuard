  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code content verification**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to `__version__` and contains a copyright notice.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**:\n   - No factual inaccuracies are apparent. All reports consistently describe the code as benign and standard.\n   - The only minor note is the mention of the year 2025, which is future-dated but not suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues**:\n   - All reports assign `malware`, `obfuscated`, and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious or risky behavior; all assign zero to malware and security risk.\n   - The code is a static version string, which is standard practice.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - No suspicious assumptions are made; all analyses correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- The code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence to suggest any hidden malicious intent or security vulnerability.",
