  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.32\"`) with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no input sources, sinks, data flows, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious constructs are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, standard, and contains no malicious or security issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - No overstatement or unwarranted suspicion is present.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 1.0 for confidence, and 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores for malware and security risk are 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) supports the conclusion that the code is safe.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores are justified as 0, given the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score = 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they focus on the code's static, straightforward nature.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, static version declaration with no dynamic or external interactions. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the evidence.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a benign, standard version declaration. No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with high confidence in the benign nature of the code.",
