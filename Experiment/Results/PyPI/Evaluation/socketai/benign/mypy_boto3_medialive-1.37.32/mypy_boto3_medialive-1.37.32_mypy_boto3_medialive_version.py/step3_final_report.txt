  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version declaration with a future year in the comment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a copyright comment and a static assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external dependencies. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for version declaration. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The future year (2025) in the comment is unusual but not malicious. The scores assigned in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence in the benign assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and safety. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
