  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as static type annotations for AWS MediaLive literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes no data handling or external I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as straightforward static declarations, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is benign with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a collection of string literal type aliases, serving as type hints, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines Python literal types for AWS MediaLive enumerations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Recognizes the conditional import pattern and the static nature of the literals.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is precise. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining string literals for AWS MediaLive configurations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes the absence of dynamic execution or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is a static type definition module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines literals for AWS resource identifiers and states.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Recognizes the conditional import pattern and the static nature.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes safety and benign intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is correct; no malicious elements are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as static type literals for AWS MediaLive options.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No handling of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notes the lack of external input, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is a benign, declarative set of type definitions.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports agree that this code is a static, benign set of type alias declarations for string literals used in AWS MediaLive SDK or configuration typing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** The code does not process, handle, or output untrusted data; it only provides type annotations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Clear, straightforward static definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risk inherent in static type declaration code.\n\n**Summary:** This code is a standard, safe, and well-structured set of type aliases intended to improve code correctness and developer experience. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
