  "purpose": "Define Python literal types for various AWS MediaLive service enumerations to ensure type safety and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "The source code itself, which contains string literals for various configuration options and enumerations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sink that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data. It only defines type aliases for literals.",
  "flows": "The type aliases are used as annotations in other parts of code that would use these types for validation or type checking; no runtime data flow occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines string literal types for documentation and type safety purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard. It then defines a comprehensive set of string literal types for AWS MediaLive configuration options. The '__all__' list explicitly exports these types, which indicates intended use for type annotations and auto-completion. No code executes any logic, makes network calls, handles sensitive data, or includes obfuscated or malicious patterns. All definitions are straightforward and serve as static type hints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definitions module for AWS MediaLive service literals, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It purely serves as a type safety aid and documentation aid for developers using these literals.",
