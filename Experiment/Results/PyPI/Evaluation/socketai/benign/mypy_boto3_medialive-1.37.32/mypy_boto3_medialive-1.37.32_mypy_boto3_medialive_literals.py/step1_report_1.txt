{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations for various string literal types used in AWS MediaLive service configurations, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals defining permissible values for different configuration options and service identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform I/O operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares type aliases for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward static declaration of string literal types. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. It does include a copyright notice and usage example, but these are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines numerous type aliases as string literal unions. These types serve to restrict variable assignments to valid predefined strings, supporting type checking. No dynamic execution, external network access, or obfuscated patterns are observed. The code's structure and content are typical for generated type definitions or SDK stubs. No malicious logic, data leakage, or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias declarations for AWS MediaLive configuration options. It is designed to improve code correctness and readability and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
