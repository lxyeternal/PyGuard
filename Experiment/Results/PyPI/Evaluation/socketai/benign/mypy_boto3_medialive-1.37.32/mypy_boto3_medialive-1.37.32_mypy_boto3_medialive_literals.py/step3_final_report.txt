{
  "purpose": "Static string literals defining enumerations and configuration options for AWS MediaLive services, used for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it consists solely of predefined string literal type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only provides static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type alias declarations using Python's Literal types, conditionally importing Literal based on Python version. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or obfuscated code. It serves as a type safety aid for SDKs or codebases interacting with AWS MediaLive, with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and purely declarative, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard type declaration module for SDK or documentation purposes.",
