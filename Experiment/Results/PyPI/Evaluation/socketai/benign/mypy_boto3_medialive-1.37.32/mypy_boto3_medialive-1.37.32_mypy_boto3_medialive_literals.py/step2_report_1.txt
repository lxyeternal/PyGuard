  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a static declaration of string literal types used as type annotations for AWS MediaLive configurations.\n- No dynamic execution, data processing, or external I/O is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors.\n- The code is purely declarative, meant for type safety and autocompletion.\n\n**2. Logical Flaws or Mistakes:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and free of malicious logic.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- The extensive list of string literals is consistent and appears to be auto-generated or maintained for SDK purposes.\n- No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Risk scores are also 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating that the reviewers agree on the benign assessment.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no security concern.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- Therefore, the risk scores are justified as zero.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- The malware score is zero across all reports.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n- The code only defines type aliases, which is safe.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports base their assessments on observable facts: static definitions, no runtime logic, no external interactions.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made; the conclusion of benignity is well-supported.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with Content:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- The code is a benign, static set of type alias declarations for AWS MediaLive literals.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and well-justified.\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe type declaration module with no security concerns.",
