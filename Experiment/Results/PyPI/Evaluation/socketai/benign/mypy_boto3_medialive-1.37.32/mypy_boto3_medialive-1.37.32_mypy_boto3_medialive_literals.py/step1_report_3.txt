{
  "purpose": "To define Python type literals for various AWS MediaLive service enumerations and other string constants, facilitating type safety and autocompletion in code that interacts with AWS MediaLive APIs.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions imported from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version; list of string literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, input, or data output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this module only defines constants and types, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code strictly defines string literal types for AWS MediaLive enumerations without any dynamic or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports to handle different Python versions for typing.Literal support. It then defines a large number of string literal types for various AWS MediaLive configuration options, status indicators, resource identifiers, and common AWS resource names. The purpose appears to be purely for type safety, autocompletion, and documentation clarity. There are no input sources, no sinks that handle untrusted data, no dynamic execution, nor code that could execute malicious behavior. The only concern would be the inclusion of copyright information and documentation links, but these are benign and standard for open-source projects. Overall, the code is a well-structured set of type definitions with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a static type and constant definition module for AWS MediaLive service, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It is a standard, safe, and purely declarative codebase intended to improve developer experience and type safety.",
