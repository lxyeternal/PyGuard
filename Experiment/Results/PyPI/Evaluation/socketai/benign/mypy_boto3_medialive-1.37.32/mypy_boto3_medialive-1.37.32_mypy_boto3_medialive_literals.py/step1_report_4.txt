{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for MediaLive service and related AWS resource identifiers to facilitate type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Constant strings in Literal[] definitions, imported modules (sys, typing, typing_extensions)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output present",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard type aliasing for literals, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides static definitions of string literals used as type annotations for AWS MediaLive and other AWS resource identifiers. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. The extensive list of literal definitions covers various AWS resource types, states, and configuration options. No code executes external commands, writes files, or reads untrusted input. No obfuscated or dynamically generated code detected. The module appears solely as a set of static type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS MediaLive literals with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
