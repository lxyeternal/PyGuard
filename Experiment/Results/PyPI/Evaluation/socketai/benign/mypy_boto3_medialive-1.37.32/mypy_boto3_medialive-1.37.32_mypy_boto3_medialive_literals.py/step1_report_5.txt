{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various AWS MediaLive service configurations, status indicators, and supported options to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Literal type definitions, imports of 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. No external input sources or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only defines constants and types without processing untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data is evident; this is purely a type definition module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code contains only static type literals and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring describing the purpose and usage of the module, which is to provide type annotations for AWS MediaLive literal values. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, avoiding obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The bulk of the code consists of a large number of literal type definitions for enumerated options used in AWS MediaLive configurations, statuses, and resource identifiers. No code reads external input, executes system commands, or contains logic that could be malicious. It is a static type declaration module intended for type safety and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a straightforward, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS MediaLive service options. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code is purely declarative, serving as a helper for type checking, and poses no security risks.",
