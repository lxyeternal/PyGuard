  "purpose": "CLI tool for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output messages.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers info or version display; outputs written directly to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI entrypoint with functions to display package info and version. It only reads command-line arguments and outputs static information to stdout. There are no external network calls, no use of environment variables, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling. The code appears well-structured and simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions solely as a CLI interface for displaying static package information and version details. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity is present. It is a benign utility script.",
