{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a Python package that provides information about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs package info or version via sys.stdout.write.",
  "targets": "Outputs are directed to stdout; no untrusted data sources or external inputs are involved.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in sys.argv, the code calls print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, it calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The script functions solely as a CLI tool, printing static information based on command-line input. It imports sys and uses sys.stdout.write for output, with no input parsing beyond checking for '--version'. There are no external data sources, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The code's purpose is benign and typical for CLI utilities. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clean, straightforward, and safe.",
