  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), checks for '--version', and writes static info to stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs static strings; no untrusted data or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input: command-line argument '--version' -> Output: version info or package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI script that performs a simple argument check and outputs fixed information. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
