  "purpose": "CLI script providing package information and version details for boto3 MediaLive stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, writes package info and version to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout, no untrusted data sinks or external calls.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check in main() → calls print_version() or print_info() → outputs to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool that outputs static information about a package. It reads command-line input but only uses it to determine whether to display version info. It writes predefined static strings to stdout without any external calls, data processing, or handling untrusted input. There are no suspicious behaviors, external network access, or data leaks present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a informational CLI utility with no malicious or security risks detected.",
