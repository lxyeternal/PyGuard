  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- A minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version.\n- Checks for \"--version\" argument.\n- Uses sys.stdout.write for output.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- Overall, benign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports correctly identify that the code only outputs static information and does not perform any malicious or suspicious operations.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent with the code. They correctly state that the script is simple, static, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  No, the code does not warrant higher scores. The assessments are justified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code shows no signs of malicious activity, so malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the static and benign nature.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n  The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Potential hidden issues?**  \n  No hidden issues are evident. The code is very straightforward.\n\n- **Any overlooked security concern?**  \n  No. The code does not handle untrusted input beyond a simple argument check, and it outputs static info only.\n\n- **Are the documentation links or static info suspicious?**  \n  No, they are standard documentation links.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risk.\n\n**Overall:** The reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes needed. The code is safe, straightforward, and carries no security risks.",
