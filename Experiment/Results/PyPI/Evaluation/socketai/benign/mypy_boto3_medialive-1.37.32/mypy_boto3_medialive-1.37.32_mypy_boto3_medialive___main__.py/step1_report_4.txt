  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a Python package related to boto3 MediaLive, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output messages",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing package info and version",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> main() function -> print_info() or print_version() -> output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and primarily outputs static information.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs package and documentation info based on command-line arguments. It does not process untrusted input beyond checking for '--version' in sys.argv. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. The code structure is clean, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. All data printed is static and intended for informational purposes. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a CLI informational script. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
