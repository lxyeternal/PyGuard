  "purpose": "Provide CLI interface for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs data).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs info to stdout).",
  "flows": "Command line input (--version) triggers print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors. External network access is only for documentation links, which are safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides CLI options to display static package information and version. It imports sys for input/output operations and defines functions to print details. The main function checks for a '--version' argument and outputs the relevant info. There are no external data sources, network calls, or data processing beyond simple printing. No secrets, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are detected. The code appears straightforward and intended for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI tool to display package info and version. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
