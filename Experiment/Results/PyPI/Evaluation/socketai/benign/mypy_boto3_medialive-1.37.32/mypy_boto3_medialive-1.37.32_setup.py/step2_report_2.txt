  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; code is a standard setup script.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Given no malicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is static, well-structured, and contains no suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; standard package setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. No malicious activity, so risk score of 0 is justified.\n- **Justification:** No external inputs, no suspicious code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; typical setup script.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. No security concerns, so risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Static configuration, no dynamic or malicious code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; standard setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. No malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** Static, well-structured code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected; typical setup script.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** No dynamic behavior or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is clear and static.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.5, which is a default low risk score for benign scripts. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, a risk score of **0** would be more appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are reasonable but could be adjusted to reflect the absence of any risk more accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and typical for package setup.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The risk score should be lowered from 0.5 to 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed explanation or further analysis.",
