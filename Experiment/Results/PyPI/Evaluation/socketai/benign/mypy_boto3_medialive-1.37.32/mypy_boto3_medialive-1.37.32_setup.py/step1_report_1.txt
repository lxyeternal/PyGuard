  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-medialive package, used for packaging and distribution of Python modules.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing 'setup' from setuptools; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no external data or inputs are processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads a local README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed parameters. All data appears static and related to package configuration. No external input handling or network activity is present. The code follows standard Python packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely handles package configuration and metadata.",
