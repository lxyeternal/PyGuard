{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-medialive package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing 'setup' from setuptools; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for long description during setup; importing and executing setup function to install package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a standard setup script without obfuscated or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for filesystem operations and setuptools for packaging. It reads the README.md file for long description, which is standard practice. The setup() call contains typical package metadata, including name, version, URL, author info, classifiers, keywords, and dependencies. All data appears consistent with a legitimate Python package setup. No user input, untrusted data sources, or suspicious behaviors are detected. No code injection, external network connections, or malicious code execution points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to prepare the package for distribution, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
