  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-medialive package, used for package installation and metadata specification.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; imports from pathlib and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points present in the code.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION; passes static arguments to setup() with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: importing modules, reading a README file, and calling setup() with fixed arguments. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed. The code appears to be a typical, benign package configuration script. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
