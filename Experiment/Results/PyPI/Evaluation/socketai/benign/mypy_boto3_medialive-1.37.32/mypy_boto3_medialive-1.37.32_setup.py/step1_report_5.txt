{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-medialive package, used to define package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted data processing or network connections.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the script mainly sets package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the script adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No hardcoded secrets, no code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and reads a local README.md file for long description. It then calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, author, description, classifiers, keywords, URLs, requirements, and package data. All components are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated segments, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
