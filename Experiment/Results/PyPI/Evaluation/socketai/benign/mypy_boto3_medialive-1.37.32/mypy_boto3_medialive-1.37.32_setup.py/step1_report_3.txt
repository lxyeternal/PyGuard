{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-medialive package, used for configuring and installing the package with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and static string values for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, user input, or external data sources; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script performs static configuration without dynamic data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The script only performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata and configuration. There are no dynamic inputs, no code execution beyond static configuration, and no network or system commands. The dependencies are standard, and the structure follows common Python package setup patterns. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
