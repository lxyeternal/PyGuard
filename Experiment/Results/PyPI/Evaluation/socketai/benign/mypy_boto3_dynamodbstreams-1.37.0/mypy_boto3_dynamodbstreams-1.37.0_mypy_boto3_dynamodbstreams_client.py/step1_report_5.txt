  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS DynamoDB Streams service, providing type safety and structured API access.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially sys.version_info checks for conditional imports; class attributes; method definitions with parameters; type definitions imported from type_defs module.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters such as **kwargs with Unpack[TypeDef], generate_presigned_url with Params; return values including str and custom type defs.",
  "flows": "Input source: method parameters (kwargs, Params), class attributes. Output sink: return values from methods like generate_presigned_url, describe_stream, get_records, get_shard_iterator, list_streams.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info to conditionally import modules; no apparent hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious external network activity; the code mainly defines type annotations and a client interface. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for DynamoDB Streams with proper type annotations and exception handling. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. The class methods are well-documented, wrapping underlying boto3 calls, and use type hints to specify expected inputs and outputs. There are no signs of malicious payloads, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The generate_presigned_url method handles URL creation with provided parameters, which is typical for AWS SDK clients. Overall, this code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-annotated client interface for AWS DynamoDB Streams. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident. It primarily provides type safety and method signatures for interacting with the service.",
