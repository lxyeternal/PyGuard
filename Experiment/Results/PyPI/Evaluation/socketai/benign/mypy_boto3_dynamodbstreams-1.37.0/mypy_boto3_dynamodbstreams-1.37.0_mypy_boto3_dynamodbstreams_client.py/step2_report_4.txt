  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard type annotation and client class wrapper for DynamoDB Streams, with no malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code aligns with AWS SDK standards.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (default low risk).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The code is primarily type annotations and class definitions, with no signs of malicious activity. The risk score of 0.5 is acceptable, given the potential for misuse of presigned URLs, but since no actual execution or data manipulation occurs, a lower score (e.g., 0.1) could be justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's straightforward nature, no suspicious patterns, and standard structure.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly above zero but minimal).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent. The code is a typical SDK wrapper with type annotations. The low risk score is justified. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK interface with proper typing, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** The only notable aspect is the presigned URL method, which could theoretically be exploited if misused, but in this context, it is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly elevated due to potential misuse of presigned URLs).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe risk score is appropriate; presigned URLs are common but can be misused if the user is malicious. Still, the code itself does not contain malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard type annotations and class wrapper, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and justified. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK interface, with no malicious activity. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to URL generation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, but the mention of URL generation slightly increases concern about potential misuse.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is reasonable. The code is safe; the small risk score accounts for potential misuse of URL generation but does not reflect actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malware (0).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (0).\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low, with some justified slight increases (0.1-0.2) due to URL generation features, which is appropriate.\n\n### **My Final Assessment**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation and SDK wrapper for AWS DynamoDB Streams.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The risk scores assigned are reasonable, considering the potential for misuse of presigned URLs but not indicative of actual malicious intent.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal potential misuse, but not actual threat)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and well-typed. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1 for conservative accuracy, but overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
