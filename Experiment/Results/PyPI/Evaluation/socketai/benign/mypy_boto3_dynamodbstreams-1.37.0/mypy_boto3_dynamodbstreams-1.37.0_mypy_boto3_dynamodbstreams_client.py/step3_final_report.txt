  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for DynamoDB Streams SDK wrapper, facilitating type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (kwargs), class properties, method signatures, conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "API call parameters, return values, exception handling, presigned URL generation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API methods; outputs and exceptions flow out; presigned URLs are generated for clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; version-dependent imports are standard; future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations, exception classes, and conditional imports for compatibility. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data exfiltration logic. The presence of generate_presigned_url is typical and not malicious. No signs of obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The risk of misuse of presigned URLs is acknowledged but is a common feature in AWS SDKs, not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static, type-safe wrapper for DynamoDB Streams API. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minor risk associated with presigned URL generation is standard and does not imply malicious activity.",
