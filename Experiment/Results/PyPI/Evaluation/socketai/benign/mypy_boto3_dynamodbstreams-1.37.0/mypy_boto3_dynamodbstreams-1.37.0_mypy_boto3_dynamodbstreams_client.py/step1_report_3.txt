  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for DynamoDB Streams service, providing a typed interface for AWS DynamoDB Streams API.",
  "sources": "Module imports (sys, typing, botocore), type definitions from .type_defs, and class/method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Methods like generate_presigned_url, describe_stream, get_records, get_shard_iterator, list_streams, which handle AWS API calls and parameters.",
  "flows": "Inputs from method parameters, especially the kwargs unpacked into specific input types, flow into AWS API calls via boto3 client methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data flows. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily consists of type annotations and API interface wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations and a class interface for the DynamoDB Streams client, following standard patterns for AWS SDK wrapper classes. No code performs network communication directly; it relies on boto3/botocore, which are established libraries. No suspicious or malicious constructs such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection are present. The only notable aspect is the presigned URL generation method, which could theoretically be exploited if misused, but in this context, it is standard for AWS SDKs and does not contain malicious logic. Overall, the code appears to be a well-typed, standard SDK interface with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation and interface wrapper for the DynamoDB Streams AWS SDK client, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly annotates AWS API methods and handles input/output types without performing any suspicious operations.",
