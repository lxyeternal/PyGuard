  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations and client class for DynamoDB Streams.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard imports, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely structural, defining types and class interfaces aligned with boto3. No dynamic execution, no network activity, no data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured, safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, standard patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward type annotation and class definitions, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with detailed input/output handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a standard AWS SDK wrapper with type annotations. The only notable feature is `generate_presigned_url`, which is typical and not malicious.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.1 (0.1), justified because presigned URLs can be misused if exposed, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Malware score:** 0, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Risk: 0.1 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous reports.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a well-typed client interface, with no dynamic code or external system calls.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same general purpose.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, standard imports, conditional version handling.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of `generate_presigned_url` is typical and not suspicious.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, justified because the presigned URL could be misused if the code were compromised, but the code itself is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis. No malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1/0.2, justified by the presence of presigned URL functionality, which could be misused if the code were compromised, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\nGiven the review, I agree with the scores provided. The code is a standard, well-typed, non-malicious SDK interface wrapper for DynamoDB Streams.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the presigned URL's potential misuse if exploited, but the code itself is benign)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No further adjustments needed.",
