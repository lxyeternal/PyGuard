{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client wrapper for DynamoDB Streams service in boto3, intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs module; environment version checks; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (kwargs) through method calls to AWS SDK functions, with no manipulation of untrusted data within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected. The code is primarily type annotations and straightforward wrapper methods. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations and class structure for interacting with DynamoDB Streams via boto3. It includes environment-based imports, class definitions with exception typing, and method signatures with type hints. There are no code injection points, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code snippets. The code is well-structured and appears to be a standard, documented client interface for AWS DynamoDB Streams.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type annotations and client class wrapper for the DynamoDB Streams AWS service. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks. It is a well-formed, safe interface for AWS SDK usage.",
