{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for DynamoDB Streams service in boto3, providing structured typing and exception handling for Python developers.",
  "sources": "Reading input parameters for API calls (kwargs unpacked for methods like describe_stream, get_records, get_shard_iterator, list_streams), import statements for modules, and class property/method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Return values of methods, exception attributes, and the generated presigned URL, which could potentially be misused if malicious code modifies inputs or intercepts outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) flow into API method calls; return values flow out; exceptions are accessed via self.exceptions; generated URLs flow out of generate_presigned_url.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code primarily defines type annotations, class structure, and method signatures aligned with AWS boto3 standards. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard type annotation and client class wrapper for AWS DynamoDB Streams, including exception class definitions. It imports necessary modules, uses conditional imports based on Python version, and defines methods that correspond to boto3 client operations with appropriate typing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious control flow. The presigned URL method is typical for AWS SDKs and not inherently malicious. The class and exception definitions serve to facilitate safe API interactions, not to perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Python module providing type annotations and a client wrapper for DynamoDB Streams. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident. It appears to be a benign part of a SDK or type stub package intended for safe development and type checking.",
