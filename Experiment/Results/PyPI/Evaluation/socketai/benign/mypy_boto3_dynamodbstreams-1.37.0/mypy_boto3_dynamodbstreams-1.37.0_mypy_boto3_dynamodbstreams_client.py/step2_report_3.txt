  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, logical flaws, or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code is for type annotations and client class definitions for DynamoDB Streams, based on reading API call parameters, imports, and class/method structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input parameters flow into API calls; outputs and exceptions flow out. The presigned URL could be misused if intercepted.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard, aligning with AWS SDK patterns. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is benign, serving as a type stub/wrapper for AWS SDK. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1—type annotations and client class for DynamoDB Streams, with standard imports and version checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No apparent data leaks or external calls beyond API method signatures.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns. The future date (2025) is again noted but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, standard for AWS SDK wrappers, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or risky behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type annotations, class wrappers, and method signatures for DynamoDB Streams.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs flow into API calls; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The use of sys.version_info is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a well-typed, standard SDK interface, with no malicious behavior. The mention of the presigned URL as a potential exploitation vector is theoretical; in context, it’s standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—type annotations, class, and method definitions for DynamoDB Streams client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or suspicious external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual patterns; code is mainly type annotations and wrappers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is standard SDK interface code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type annotations, class interface, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into API calls; no untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Use of sys.version_info is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface, with no malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a well-structured, standard AWS SDK type stub/wrapper for DynamoDB Streams.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** The only minor concern is the presigned URL generation, which is a standard AWS feature; potential misuse is theoretical and not specific to this code.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** All reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** Given the overall benign nature, I would set it at approximately **0.05 to 0.1**, acknowledging the theoretical misuse of presigned URLs but recognizing that this is standard SDK behavior.\n\n**Note:** The existing scores in the reports are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-typed, standard SDK interface for DynamoDB Streams. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The reported issues are accurate, and the scores are justified.",
