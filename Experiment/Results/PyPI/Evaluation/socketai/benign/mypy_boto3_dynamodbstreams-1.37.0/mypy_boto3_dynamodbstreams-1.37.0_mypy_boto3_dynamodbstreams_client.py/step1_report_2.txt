  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the DynamoDB Streams service in boto3, facilitating type-checked AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs module; usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no use of untrusted input sources, external system calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily defines types and client interface; no runtime data flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. The license comment states 2025, which is future-dated but not suspicious. Usage of conditional imports is standard for version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and client class wrapper for the boto3 DynamoDB Streams service. It includes class definitions, method signatures, and exception class mappings, with no dynamic execution or data manipulation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious injections, or backdoors are present. The code relies on established libraries and standard patterns for AWS SDK type annotations. All imports and class structures are conventional and explicitly documented. No suspicious or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured type annotation and interface definition for boto3 DynamoDB Streams client, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
