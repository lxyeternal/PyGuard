  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a type annotation and client class wrapper for DynamoDB Streams, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It highlights the absence of dynamic code execution, network connections, or data exfiltration logic.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely structural, defining types, exceptions, and method signatures aligned with boto3. No runtime logic or data manipulation is present. The presigned URL method is standard in AWS SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (reasonable given the nature of SDK wrappers).\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. Notes the future-dated copyright (2025) but finds it non-suspicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code remains a standard SDK interface with no signs of malicious activity. The use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard practice.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes the code's standard pattern, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious flows. It mentions the presigned URL as a potential concern but correctly states that it's typical in AWS SDKs.\n\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.1 is justified because, while presigned URLs can be misused if mishandled, in this context, it's a standard method. The code does not perform any dynamic or malicious operations.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard type annotation and client wrapper, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It highlights the version-dependent imports and standard method signatures.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is to facilitate type-safe API calls.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's standard structure, with no suspicious anomalies. It notes the use of conditional imports for compatibility and standard method signatures.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The risk score of 0.2 is slightly higher but still reasonable given the presence of URL generation, which can be misused if exposed improperly. However, in the context of an SDK wrapper, this is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with a malware score of 0.0. The code is a standard SDK interface with no dynamic or malicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as not obfuscated, score of 0.0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are generally low, reflecting the nature of the code as a type annotation and SDK wrapper. The highest is 0.5, which is reasonable given the presence of URL generation, but even that is standard.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, type-annotated wrapper for AWS DynamoDB Streams client, primarily serving as a static interface with no runtime logic or data processing.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The presence of URL generation is typical for SDKs and does not imply malicious intent.\n- The code does not handle untrusted input directly; it merely defines interfaces and types.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — Clear, standard code structure.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to URL generation, but still very low given the context.\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across reports.",
