  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for reference.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward version declaration with comments and a copyright notice. No inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs are present. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. Confidence scores are high, reflecting the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The minor anomaly (future year) does not impact security. All reports are accurate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
