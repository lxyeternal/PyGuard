  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package, serving as a source of truth for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ from a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future, but this is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable and contains a copyright comment. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, no network calls, or code execution. The license and versioning are standard. The future copyright year could be considered unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or malware. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not harmful.",
