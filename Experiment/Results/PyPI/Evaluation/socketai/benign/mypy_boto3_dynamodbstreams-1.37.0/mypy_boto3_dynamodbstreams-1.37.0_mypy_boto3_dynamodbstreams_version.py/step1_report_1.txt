  "flows": "Simple assignment, no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only metadata; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string for the package, with a comment indicating the source of truth and a copyright notice. There are no input operations, data processing, or external communications. The version is hardcoded, which is typical for package versioning, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
