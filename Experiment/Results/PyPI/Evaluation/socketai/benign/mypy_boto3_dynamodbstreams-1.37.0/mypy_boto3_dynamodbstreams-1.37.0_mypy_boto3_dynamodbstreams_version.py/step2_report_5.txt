  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\nThe code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a comment and a copyright notice. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or complex logic. The code is typical for Python packages to declare their version.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No, all reports correctly identify that the code only sets a version string with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. All reports correctly note the benign nature of the code, the absence of data flows, and the lack of anomalies other than the future copyright year.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Confidence scores:** All are 0.9 or 1, which is appropriate given the straightforwardness.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Security risk:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Specific Anomalies:\n- The only recurring anomaly is the future copyright year (2025).  \n  This is not malicious but could be considered outdated or placeholder info. It does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** Since there's no malicious behavior, all scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, a score of 0 is justified. No report suggests any malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The fifth report assigns a confidence of 0.9, which is slightly lower than the others but still acceptable.  \n- The same report notes the future copyright year as an anomaly, but this does not warrant an increased risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** All reports are consistent with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Overall Security Assessment:** The code is benign, serving only as a version indicator.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming the code's benign and standard nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor anomaly of a future copyright year does not impact security. The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and standard.",
