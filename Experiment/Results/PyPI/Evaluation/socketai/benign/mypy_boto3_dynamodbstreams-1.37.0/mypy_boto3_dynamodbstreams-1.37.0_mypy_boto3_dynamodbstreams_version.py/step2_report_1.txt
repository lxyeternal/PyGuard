  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe code is a straightforward version declaration:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\nIt contains only comments, a copyright notice, and a static assignment of the version string. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, the code is minimal and standard.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code is purely metadata.\n- **Obfuscation:** No, the code is clear.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n- All correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string, with no data flow, no external input, and no suspicious behavior.\n- They note the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but benign.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The conclusions are appropriate: standard version declaration, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the future year.\n- It correctly states no security risks or malware.\n- The mention of the future year as an anomaly is reasonable; it doesn't imply maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is the future year (2025). While unusual, it does not constitute a security risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the future copyright year as a minor anomaly, but not necessary)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minor anomaly (future year) does not impact security.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the reports' conclusions or scores. They correctly reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.",
