{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS DynamoDB Streams service and other AWS resource identifiers, primarily for type annotations and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from sys.version_info and imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no input/output operations, network connections, or data handling from external sources are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code only assigns predefined string literals to type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code consists of static type definitions, version checks for compatibility, and a large list of string literals for type annotations. No hidden code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides type annotations for AWS DynamoDB Streams and other AWS resource identifiers using Literal types. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. The module only contains type definitions and constant string literals, with no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity. The license comment and documentation links are non-executable and typical for open-source projects. No signs of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK components, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, harmless module for type hinting support.",
