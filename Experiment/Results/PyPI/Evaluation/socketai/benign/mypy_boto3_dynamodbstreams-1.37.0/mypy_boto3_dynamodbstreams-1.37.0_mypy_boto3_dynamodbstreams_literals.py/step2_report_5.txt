  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is purely static type definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** None identified. The future date (2025) in the copyright is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk scores?** No risk or malware scores should be higher; the report's assessments are justified.\n- **Potential assumptions?** The report correctly notes that this is static, benign code.\n- **Overall:** Accurate, no concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code only defines static string literal types.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The import version check is standard.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Justification?** No malicious activity; the report's reasoning is sound.\n- **Potential assumptions?** None; the report avoids assumptions.\n- **Overall:** Correct and thorough.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Static constants for AWS resource types.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None detected.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0, justified.\n- **Justification?** The code is purely static type annotations.\n- **Potential assumptions?** No, the report correctly states this.\n- **Overall:** Well-reasoned.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is static type alias definitions.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Justification?** The code is safe, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Potential assumptions?** None.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Static type annotations with version compatibility checks.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware and security risk are 0, justified.\n- **Justification?** The code is purely static, with no malicious intent.\n- **Potential assumptions?** No, the report correctly identifies this.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward static type definitions.\n\n**Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign static type definition module for AWS SDKs, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
