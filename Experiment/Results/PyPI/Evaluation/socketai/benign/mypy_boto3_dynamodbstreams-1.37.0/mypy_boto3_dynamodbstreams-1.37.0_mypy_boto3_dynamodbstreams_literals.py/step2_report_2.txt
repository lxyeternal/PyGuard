  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for DynamoDB streams literals.\n- Sources: Static data, no external input.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static, no data flow.\n- Anomalies: Future copyright date (2025) noted, but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Standard import pattern, static definitions, no dynamic code or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Benign static type definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.95\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type annotations with no malicious activity. The future date is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS DynamoDB Streams.\n- Sources: Standard modules, static literals.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: None.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Standard version check, static literals, no dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: Safe static type alias definitions.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report accurately states that the code is safe, purely static, and intended for type checking.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for AWS DynamoDB Streams and related constants.\n- Sources: Static literals.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static definitions only.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: Standard import pattern, static data, no dynamic execution.\n- Conclusion: Safe, static, benign.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly notes the code is static and harmless.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: String literal types for AWS services and regions.\n- Sources: Import statements, version check, static literals.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no dynamic code or external data.\n- Conclusion: Benign static type definitions.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's static nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: String literals for AWS resource identifiers.\n- Sources: Version check, static literals.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: None.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity.\n- Analysis: Static definitions, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, static type annotations.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as static and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is static, solely defining string literal types for AWS SDK type checking.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk, static type definitions only)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the consistent evidence across all reports, I concur with their conclusions. The code is a benign, static set of type annotations with no security concerns.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis module is safe, harmless, and intended solely for static type checking support in Python projects.",
