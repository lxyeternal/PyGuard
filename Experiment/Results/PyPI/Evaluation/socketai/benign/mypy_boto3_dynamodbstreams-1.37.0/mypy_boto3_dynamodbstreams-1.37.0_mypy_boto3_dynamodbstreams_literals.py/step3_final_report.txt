  "purpose": "Define static type annotations for AWS DynamoDB streams literals and related constants to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals and import statements for type aliases; no external or user input involved.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data flow.",
  "flows": "Static definitions without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using string literals, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. No dynamic code, external data, or obfuscation present. The future date appears to be a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDKs, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
