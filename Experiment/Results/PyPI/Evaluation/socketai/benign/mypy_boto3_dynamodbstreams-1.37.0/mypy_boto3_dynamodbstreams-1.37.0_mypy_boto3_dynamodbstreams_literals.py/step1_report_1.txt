{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for DynamoDB streams service literals used in type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The module sources data from string literals and imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It does not read external inputs or user data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code only defines constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; this is purely a type definition module.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright statement with a future date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. It defines numerous string literal types for AWS service names, regions, and DynamoDB stream key types. The purpose is to facilitate static type checking. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The large number of service and region definitions are static data, not executable code. The copyright date appears in the future (2025), which might suggest an error or placeholder, but this does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is a straightforward static type annotations module with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign collection of type definitions intended for static type checking. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It is a standard pattern for defining literal types for AWS SDKs.",
