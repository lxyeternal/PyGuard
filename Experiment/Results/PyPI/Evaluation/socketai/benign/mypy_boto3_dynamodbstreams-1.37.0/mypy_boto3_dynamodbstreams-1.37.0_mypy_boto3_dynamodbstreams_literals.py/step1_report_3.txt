  "purpose": "Define type annotations and string literals for AWS DynamoDB Streams service and related AWS service identifiers.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions with string literals for AWS resource names, regions, and types. The only input data is static literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; the code solely defines static type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of conditional import for type annotations based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines string literal types for AWS services, regions, and DynamoDB Streams specific types. It includes a version check for conditional import of 'Literal', which is a common pattern to support multiple Python versions. No external input, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, nor any network or file operations are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with safe, static type annotation definitions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a safe, static type definition module for AWS resource and DynamoDB Streams types. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of constant definitions for type annotations with no security risks.",
