  "purpose": "Define string literal types for DynamoDB Streams service and various AWS service constants for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check for importing Literal, and the assignment of string literals to type variables.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs; all type definitions and imports are static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; the code solely defines type literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for DynamoDB Streams and AWS services using Python type hints. It conditionally imports Literal from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard. All variables are simple string literal types assigned to descriptive variable names, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or data handling. The extensive list of AWS service names, regions, and resource types are static definitions, serving as type hints for developers and static analyzers. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module for AWS service string literals, with no malicious intent or security threats. It is solely for type hinting and validation purposes in AWS SDK usage.",
