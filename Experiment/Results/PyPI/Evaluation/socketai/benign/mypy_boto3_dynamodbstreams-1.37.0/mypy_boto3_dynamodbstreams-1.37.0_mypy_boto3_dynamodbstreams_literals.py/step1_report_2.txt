  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS DynamoDB Streams service literals for use with type checking in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing, and the definition of various Literal types and string constants.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources or external data inputs are processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; all definitions are static literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward type annotation definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, performs a version check to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It defines numerous string literal types representing AWS resource names, regions, and service names, all static. There are no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external data handling. The purpose is solely to provide type hints for AWS SDKs, which is a standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains standard type alias definitions for AWS DynamoDB Streams literals, with no malicious or security risk behaviors. It is a benign, static configuration code intended for type checking purposes.",
