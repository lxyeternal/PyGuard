  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 DynamoDBStreams stub definitions and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes package info and version)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputs information), potential sys.argv (input), but only for display logic",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior or hidden logic",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that prints package info or version based on arguments. It imports sys for input/output, defines functions for printing static information, and has a main guard. No external inputs other than command-line arguments are used, and output is limited to static, predefined strings. There are no external data sources, no code execution from untrusted sources, and no suspicious activity or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple informational CLI utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data collection, network activity, or obscure operations.",
