  "purpose": "This script serves as a CLI entry point for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "targets": "Outputs package info and version info to stdout; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version(), otherwise calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward command-line interface logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines functions to print package info and version info to stdout. The main() function checks if '--version' is in sys.argv; if so, it prints the version; otherwise, it prints package info. The script is protected by the standard if __name__ == '__main__' guard, ensuring it runs only when executed directly. There are no obfuscated elements, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. No external network connections, data collection, or malicious operations are present. The code appears to be a typical CLI utility for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that displays package information and version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation with no suspicious or malicious code.",
