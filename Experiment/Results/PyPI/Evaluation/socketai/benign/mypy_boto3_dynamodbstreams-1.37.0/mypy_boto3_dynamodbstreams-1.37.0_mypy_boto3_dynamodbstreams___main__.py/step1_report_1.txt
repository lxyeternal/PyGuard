{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point to display package information or version details for a Python package related to boto3 DynamoDBStreams.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv); writes output to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers a flow from source (sys.argv) to sink (print_version); otherwise, flow from main() to print_info() which outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It uses standard Python libraries (sys) for input/output. No untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external network activity are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The structure and content indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that outputs static package information and version details. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
