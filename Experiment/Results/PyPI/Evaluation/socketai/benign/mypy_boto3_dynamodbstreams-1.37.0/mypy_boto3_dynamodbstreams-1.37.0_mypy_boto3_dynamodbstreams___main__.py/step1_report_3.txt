  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint that provides package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and outputs information to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Input: Command-line argument '--version' -> Output: Version info or package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscation detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines functions to print package information and version, which are invoked based on command-line input. No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data flows are present. The logic is straightforward, mainly printing static strings. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a simple CLI utility designed to provide package info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI utility to display package info and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
