  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static information about a package or its version. It checks for '--version' argument and displays relevant info accordingly. All data displayed is hardcoded and publicly available. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed. The code structure is simple, with clear functions and no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code.",
