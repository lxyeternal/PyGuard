  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to either print_version() or print_info() output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static strings, no dynamic code, no secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It uses standard Python libraries and performs straightforward checks without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: near zero) are accurate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports' assessments and scores are correct and do not require modification.",
