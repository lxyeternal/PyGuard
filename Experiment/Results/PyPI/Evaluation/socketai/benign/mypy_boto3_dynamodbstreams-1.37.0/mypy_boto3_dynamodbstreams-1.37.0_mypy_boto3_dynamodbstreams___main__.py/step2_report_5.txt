  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It outputs static package info or version info based on command-line arguments.\n- Uses only standard Python libraries (`sys`).\n- No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data handling beyond printing static strings.\n- No obfuscation, no secrets, no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and non-malicious.\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- No logical or security flaws are present.\n- No errors or mistakes in reasoning within the reports.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0.1 or 0, indicating negligible or no risk. Given the benign nature, 0 is justified.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No claims are based on assumptions; all identify the code as benign.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious activities, nor does it handle untrusted data.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nConsidering all reports and the code:\n\n| Score Type      | My Estimate |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0            |\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and justified. No changes needed. The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security risk.",
