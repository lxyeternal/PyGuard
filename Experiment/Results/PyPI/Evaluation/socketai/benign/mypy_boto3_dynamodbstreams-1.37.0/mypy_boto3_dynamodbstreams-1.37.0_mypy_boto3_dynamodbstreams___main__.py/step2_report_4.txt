  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond printing static strings.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward. The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scoring consistency:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0` and `securityRisk: 0` or very close to zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Correctly set to 0 across all reports. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Correctly set to 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a very low risk score (~0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerability, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero)  \n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a straightforward CLI utility with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports correctly reflect this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
