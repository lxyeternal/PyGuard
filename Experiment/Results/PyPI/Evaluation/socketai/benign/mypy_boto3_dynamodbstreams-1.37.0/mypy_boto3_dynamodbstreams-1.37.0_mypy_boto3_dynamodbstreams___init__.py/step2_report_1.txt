  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code details, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: it imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exports it.\n- The documentation includes usage examples, which are standard.\n- No dynamic data handling, user input, network operations, or data processing is present.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future year (2025) in the copyright and version comments, which could be placeholder or placeholder-like.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as a simple interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Future date (2025) noted as suspicious, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states the code is benign, importing and exporting classes.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- Same as above, consistent analysis, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- Similar to previous, mentions the future date but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Notes the malformed URL in documentation (https://youtype.github.io), likely a typo or placeholder.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n**Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score due to the malformed URL, but this is more of a documentation issue than a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Very low across all reports, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**However,** considering the overall analysis:\n\n- The code is very simple, with no security issues.\n- The only anomaly is the future date (2025), which is not malicious but somewhat unusual.\n- The malformed URL in report 5 is a minor documentation oversight, not a security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (minimal, mostly due to the future date and placeholder info, but not a security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores in all reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's actual behavior. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a benign, straightforward SDK interface module with no security threats. The minor anomalies (future date, placeholder URL) do not impact security but could be cleaned up for clarity.",
