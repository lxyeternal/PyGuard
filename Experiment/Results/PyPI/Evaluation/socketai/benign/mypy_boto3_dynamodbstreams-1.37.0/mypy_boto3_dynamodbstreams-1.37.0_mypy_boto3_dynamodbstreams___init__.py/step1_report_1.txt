{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for interacting with the DynamoDB Streams service using boto3, including documentation and client instantiation.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.client) and the comment block containing documentation and usage example.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the code simply imports and exposes classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly defines aliases and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright statement from 2025, which is in the future, suggesting possible tampering or placeholder text; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local client class for DynamoDB Streams, sets an alias, and defines exports. It includes documentation and usage instructions. No code executes untrusted input, performs network operations, or manipulates data in a suspicious manner. The presence of a future-dated copyright is unusual and could be a sign of tampering or placeholder info, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward interface module for DynamoDB Streams with no malicious behavior. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which warrants further review in context but does not indicate malicious activity.",
