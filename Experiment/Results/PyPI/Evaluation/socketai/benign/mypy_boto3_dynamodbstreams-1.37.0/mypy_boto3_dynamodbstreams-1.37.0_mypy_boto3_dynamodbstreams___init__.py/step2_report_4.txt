  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scores assigned, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the interface and source code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling; straightforward import/export.\n- **Anomalies:** The future copyright date (2025) is unusual.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; the future date may be placeholder or tampering but isn't inherently malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, given the unusual date but no real threat)  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear; static code with no external data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, typical SDK wrapper.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate) given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous; straightforward interface with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** Future year (2025) again noted but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar assessment; simple interface with documentation.\n- **Anomalies:** Future date in the copyright.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; mentions a typo in URL.\n- **Anomalies:** The URL (https://youtype.github.io) appears to be a typo or placeholder, which suggests incomplete documentation but not malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just incomplete or placeholder documentation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (due to placeholder URL, but minimal security concern)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low across all reports, with minor concerns about future dates and placeholder URLs, which are not security threats but might warrant a slight increase if desired.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **risk scores** are appropriately low; however, the **future date (2025)** and **placeholder URL** are minor anomalies but not security issues.\n- Given the consistent pattern and the nature of the code, I would **not** increase the malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The **risk scores** could be marginally increased to 0.2 for reports mentioning placeholder or future-dated info, but it's not necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor anomalies, but not security threats)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a straightforward SDK interface with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
