{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to the DynamoDB Streams service, acting as a wrapper or alias for the DynamoDBStreamsClient class, and includes documentation for usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module (.client import DynamoDBStreamsClient), and the docstring with example usage.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code does not process external input or output data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual or suspicious constructs. The docstring contains a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is atypical but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client class, assigns it to a variable for external use, and defines module exports. It contains only documentation, a license-like comment, and import/assignment statements. There are no embedded or hidden malicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no code injection, or suspicious network activity. The presence of a future copyright year does not impact security but is somewhat unusual. Overall, the code is simple, clean, and typical for a service interface module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured module providing an interface to DynamoDB Streams. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard part of an SDK or library wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
