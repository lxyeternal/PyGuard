  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface for DynamoDB Streams service, importing a client class and exporting it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing DynamoDBStreamsClient from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sources; static code.",
  "flows": "Import of local class to a variable, then export; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Future year (2025) in comments and documentation; malformed URL in documentation (https://youtype.github.io).",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface module with minimal logic. It imports a class, assigns it to a variable, and exports it. The documentation includes usage examples. No dynamic data, user input, network operations, or security-sensitive code are present. The only unusual aspects are the future date (2025), which appears to be a placeholder or oversight, and a typo in the documentation URL. No obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The anomalies (future date, placeholder URL) are minor and do not indicate malicious activity. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minor anomalies but no security threat.",
