{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the DynamoDB Streams service, mainly importing and exporting a client class for external use.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; static code with imports and assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code primarily defines and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module documentation, licensing information, a usage example, and simple import/export statements. There are no dynamic or malicious operations. It imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and declares module exports. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code is straightforward and typical for a Python SDK wrapper module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a wrapper or interface for DynamoDB Streams without any malicious intent or security risks.",
