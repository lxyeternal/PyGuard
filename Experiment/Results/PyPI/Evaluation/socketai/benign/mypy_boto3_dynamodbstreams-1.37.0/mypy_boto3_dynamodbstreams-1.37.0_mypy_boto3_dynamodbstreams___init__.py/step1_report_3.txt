{
  "purpose": "This code provides a main interface for the DynamoDB Streams service, primarily for importing and exposing the DynamoDBStreamsClient class for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements, the version information comment, and the example usage in the documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing classes and assigning the DynamoDBStreamsClient to a variable named Client, with no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a version comment with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. The example usage is standard and does not contain suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and defines module exports. The documentation string provides usage guidance. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a simple interface setup with no untrusted data handling, external network operations, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module interface for DynamoDB Streams with no malicious intent or security threats identified.",
