{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-dynamodbstreams package, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads environment variables indirectly through setuptools; no explicit input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow targets that process untrusted input; setup configurations are static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; package configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setuptools to define package metadata. It reads a markdown file for long description and sets up package configuration with static values, dependencies, and URLs. No input validation or untrusted data handling is present. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations are evident. The code appears standard for a Python package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It solely configures package metadata for distribution.",
