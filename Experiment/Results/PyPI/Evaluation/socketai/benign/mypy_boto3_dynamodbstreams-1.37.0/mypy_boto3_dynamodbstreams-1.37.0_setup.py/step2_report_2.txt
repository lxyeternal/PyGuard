  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and the associated scores.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Claim:** The script is benign, standard setup code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Verification:** The code is a typical setup.py, reading a README for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and defining static metadata.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified as there's no indication of security issues.  \n**Conclusion:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Claim:** Standard setup script, no malicious activity.  \n- **Verification:** Same as above; no dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Claim:** Standard, benign setup code.  \n- **Verification:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no external network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified.  \n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Claim:** Standard setup script, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Verification:** Reads a local README, static package data, no dynamic or external operations.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, consistent.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Claim:** Typical setup script, no malicious activity.  \n- **Verification:** Reads local files, static metadata, no dynamic code or network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, aligned.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified.  \n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Analysis:** All reports correctly identify that the setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** All zero, justified as there's no security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nGiven the consistency and correctness of all reports, I concur with their assessments. The setup script is a straightforward, safe package configuration.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are accurate and justified.",
