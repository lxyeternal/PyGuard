  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-dynamodbstreams package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks. The script configures package metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script structure, no hardcoded credentials, no code execution beyond package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path to read a README file for long description, then calls setup() with static metadata about the package. All data is hardcoded or derived from local files without user input or external data. No suspicious code, network activity, or environment variable misuse detected. No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The code follows typical Python package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. It solely defines package metadata and configuration, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
