  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-dynamodbstreams package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's own file content to assign to LONG_DESCRIPTION; reads package data files specified in package_data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects the system or leaks data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content to LONG_DESCRIPTION during setup; using static package data; installing dependencies with specified conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, no external network calls, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools, reads a local README file for the long description, and invokes setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The install_requires conditionally specifies a dependency based on Python version, which is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be a normal, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It only reads local files and configures package metadata for distribution.",
