  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code / Behavior**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n   - The code reads a local README.md file, imports standard modules, and calls `setup()` with static data.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   \n2. **Obfuscation**:\n   - The code is clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n   \n3. **Malware / Security Risks**:\n   - The script does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No external calls, no environment variable manipulations beyond standard setup, no code injection.\n   \n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   \n5. **Potential Discrepancies**:\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - The overall confidence is high (1), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   \n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The only minor point is the `install_requires` conditionally including `typing-extensions` for Python <3.12, which is standard and safe.\n   - The URLs, author info, and version are all standard and publicly available.\n   \n**Conclusion**:\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks detected)\n\nThis aligns with the consensus in the reports.\n\n**Final notes**:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe setup script is a standard, safe package configuration with no security concerns.",
