  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-dynamodbstreams package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, no external communication, no user input handling.",
  "flows": "Static data used directly in setup() call; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and static, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script that reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. It does not execute any dynamic code, perform network operations, or handle untrusted input. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign package setup configuration with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
