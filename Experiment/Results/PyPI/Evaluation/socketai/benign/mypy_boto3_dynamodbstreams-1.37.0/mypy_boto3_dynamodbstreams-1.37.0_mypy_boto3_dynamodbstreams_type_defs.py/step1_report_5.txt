{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for DynamoDB Streams service in Python, providing structured data models for API inputs and outputs.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from '.literals' module, sys.version_info for environment checks, and standard library modules such as sys, datetime, and typing.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines types and does not process external input or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—this code is purely declarative, defining data types without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains standard type definitions and environment compatibility imports with no unusual logic or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various TypedDict classes for DynamoDB Streams, uses conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, and imports literals from a local module. There are no functions, no data processing, nor runtime logic that could be malicious. The use of sys.version_info for environment adaptation is standard practice. The imports and definitions appear to serve type hinting purposes only, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code includes copyright information and documentation links, consistent with open-source standards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely type definition for a DynamoDB Streams SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended solely for type hinting and API modeling.",
