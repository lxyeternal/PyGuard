  "purpose": "Type annotations for DynamoDB Streams service type definitions, providing static type information for better code clarity and type checking.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, version checks, and type definition classes with no runtime data handling or external input processing.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions at runtime.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type declarations without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, data processing, network communication, or handling of untrusted input. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to define data structures for type checking and documentation, making it inherently safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for DynamoDB Streams, with no malicious intent or security risks. All observed signals confirm its benign nature. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
