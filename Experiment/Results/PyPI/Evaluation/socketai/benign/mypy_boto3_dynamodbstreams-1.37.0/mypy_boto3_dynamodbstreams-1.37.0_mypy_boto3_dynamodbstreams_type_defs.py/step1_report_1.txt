  "purpose": "Type definitions for DynamoDB Streams service in Python, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constants import, sys.version_info checks, type annotations, and the module's class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is processed or outputted based on untrusted input; mainly static type declarations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; only type annotations and class definitions are present, which do not process data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are detected. Usage of version checks for imports is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version, all for defining data structures. No input/output, network, file operations, or runtime data processing is present. The code appears purely declarative and adheres to best practices for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for DynamoDB Streams with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime, only defining data structures.",
