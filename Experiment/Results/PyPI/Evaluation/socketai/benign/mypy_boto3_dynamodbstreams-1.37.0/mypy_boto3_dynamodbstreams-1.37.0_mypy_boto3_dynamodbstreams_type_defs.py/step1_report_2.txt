  "purpose": "Type definitions for DynamoDB Streams service using TypedDict for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local modules. No external untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks such as network, filesystem, or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static type definitions with no runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only type definitions and imports; no executable logic, data handling, or user input processing. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines data types for DynamoDB stream structures with conditional imports based on Python version. No runtime code, data manipulation, or external communications are present. The code is purely declarative, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module consists of static type definitions for DynamoDB Streams, with no executable or data handling code that could pose security risks. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
