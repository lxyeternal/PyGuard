  "purpose": "Type definitions for DynamoDB Streams service to enable type-safe interactions in Python code.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (sys, datetime, typing), local module (.literals), and built-in functions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no use of untrusted input sources, network operations, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and data structure definitions; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior; the code is solely type definitions with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions for DynamoDB Streams using TypedDict, with conditional imports based on Python version. It only declares data structures and imports necessary modules; no data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be safe, intended solely for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for DynamoDB Streams, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any runtime operations or data handling that could lead to security issues.",
