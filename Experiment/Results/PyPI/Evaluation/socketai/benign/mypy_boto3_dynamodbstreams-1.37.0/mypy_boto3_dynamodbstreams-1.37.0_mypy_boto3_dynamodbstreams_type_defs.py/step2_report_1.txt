  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and cross-referencing with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type definitions for DynamoDB Streams; sources are standard imports and version checks.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime data processing; purely static type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; no external untrusted input sources.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Only type definitions, no data handling or executable logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is static type info only, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent and accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, data structures, standard library imports.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code or runtime data flow; only type definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, purely for static type checking.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMatches the code's nature. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic execution or data processing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard imports, version checks, documentation.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No executable code or data handling; only type definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, intended for type hinting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that this is purely static type definitions with no runtime or data processing.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None detected; no external data handling or code execution.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the nature of the code—only static type annotations, class definitions, and conditional imports—the risk scores should all remain at **0.5 or below**, with the most appropriate being **0**. The malware score should be **0** because there is no malicious activity or code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS DynamoDB Streams, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are reasonable. The code is safe, purely declarative, and does not pose any security threat.",
