  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely composed of type annotations, class definitions, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or external input handling is present.\n- The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is to define data structures for DynamoDB Streams in Python, primarily for static type checking and documentation.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with confidence scores of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:**  \n  No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code. The code does not process data at runtime; it only declares types.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**  \n  No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code adheres to standard practices for type annotations and compatibility.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code is only type definitions with no executable or malicious logic, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques. The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of runtime or external interactions.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or claims:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is declarative and does not process untrusted data, making any assumptions about vulnerabilities unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n- **Justification for risk higher than 0.5:**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are 0 or 0.0, indicating no risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard set of type definitions for DynamoDB Streams, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and purely declarative. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
