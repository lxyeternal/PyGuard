{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS DynamoDB Streams service, intended for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (__future__, sys, datetime, typing), local module (.literals), and module-level code defining type classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines types without executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process runtime data flows but only sets up static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly defines data types and includes no dynamic execution, network calls, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, defines multiple TypedDict classes for structured data, and includes docstrings with usage documentation. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code appears to be standard for type annotations and documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions for DynamoDB Streams, with no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is intended for static type checking and documentation, not runtime data processing.",
