  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for DynamoDB Streams.\n- Findings: No data processing, no runtime logic, purely static type annotations.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious activity. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for DynamoDB Streams.\n- Findings: No external input handling, no data flow, only static types.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior, purely static.\n- Scores: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above; the code is static type annotations only. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for DynamoDB Streams.\n- Findings: No runtime code, no data processing, only type definitions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is purely for static type checking.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations for DynamoDB Streams.\n- Findings: No dynamic code, no data handling, only type definitions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Safe, intended for static type hints.\n- Scores: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions for DynamoDB Streams.\n- Findings: No runtime logic, no external data processing, standard imports.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Purely type definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is standard for type annotations.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a set of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- **Behavior:** No runtime logic, no data processing, no external inputs, no network or file operations.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None. No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no embedded secrets.\n- **Security Risks:** None evident, as the code does not perform any actions at runtime that could compromise security.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerability)\n- **Justification:** The code is purely declarative, intended for static type checking and documentation. It does not process data, execute code dynamically, or interact with external systems.\n\n**Summary:** This supply chain report correctly identifies the nature of the code as safe and benign. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content and behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
