  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type definitions for DynamoDB Streams, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code uses standard practices such as conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code is present.\n- The purpose is purely for static type checking, documentation, and ensuring type safety.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears correct and aligned with its purpose.\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are detected in the code logic or structure.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and purely declarative.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero, no justification needed.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No suspicious imports, code execution, or data handling.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as purely static type definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign set of type definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No additional security review is necessary for this code snippet.",
