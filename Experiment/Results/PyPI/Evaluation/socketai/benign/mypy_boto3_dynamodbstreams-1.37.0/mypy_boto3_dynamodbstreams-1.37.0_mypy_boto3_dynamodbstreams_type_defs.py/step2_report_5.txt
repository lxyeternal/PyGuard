  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of actual code issues, potential security concerns, and the validity of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- There is no runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The code is well-documented, with references and usage examples.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose appears to be providing static type definitions for DynamoDB Streams in Python.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is static type definitions with no runtime data flow.\n- **Security & Malware:** No malicious intent, no data processing, no external input handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — **reasonable**.\n- **Conclusion:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is purely type annotations.\n- **Security & Malware:** No issues, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, confirms static type definitions with no runtime behavior.\n- **Security & Malware:** No malicious patterns or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — **justified**.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the code as type annotations with no data processing.\n- **Security & Malware:** No signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Notes the code's role as type definitions, with environment compatibility.\n- **Security & Malware:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — **correct**.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Observations & Justification**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual code issues or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly assign zero scores, as the code is straightforward type annotations.\n- **Security Risks:** No runtime code, no data handling, no external inputs, no network operations.\n- **Assumptions & Claims:** All claims are based on the static, declarative nature of the code, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain **0**, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n**The provided scores are consistent and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for DynamoDB Streams.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The reports' evaluations are accurate and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Therefore, I concur with the given assessments.**",
