{
  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying that specific properties of Photos framework change detail classes return boolean values, ensuring API correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads static property accessors such as assetContentChanged, objectWasDeleted, hasIncrementalChanges, and hasMoves from Photos framework classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code accesses properties directly; no data flows from external sources to sinks, as it only performs static assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test suite asserting that certain Photos framework properties return boolean values. It uses version gating and standard testing assertions. There are no data leaks, external inputs, or malicious behaviors. The code's purpose is purely API validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All indicators point to benign, standard testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API validation test suite with no security risks or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
