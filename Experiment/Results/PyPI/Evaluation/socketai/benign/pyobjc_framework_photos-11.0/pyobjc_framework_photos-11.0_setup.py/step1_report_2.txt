{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-Photos' Python module, specifically a wrapper for the Photos framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "The script reads its own directory contents to identify module dependencies (os.listdir), environment variables (via sys.path), and static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly performs static configuration for package building.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading module files from the 'Modules' directory and passing them as dependencies for the extension module; no untrusted data flows into sensitive system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration for building a macOS framework wrapper. It imports standard libraries, modifies sys.path to include local modules, defines package metadata, and configures extension modules with dependencies. The use of 'os.listdir' is to dynamically gather dependencies from the 'Modules' directory, which is typical in package setup scripts. There are no suspicious network operations, code injections, or dynamic executions. The script does not process external untrusted inputs beyond the filesystem listing, which is safe. Overall, this code appears benign and purely focused on package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python extension module for macOS. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe to use and does not pose security risks.",
