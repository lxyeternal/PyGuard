{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up Python bindings for the macOS Photos framework using PyObjC, facilitating the use of native macOS APIs within Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory to list module dependencies with os.listdir('Modules') and reads the script's own directory via os.path.dirname(__file__).",
  "sinks": "The code uses 'setup' and 'Extension' functions from pyobjc_setup to compile and install extension modules; no untrusted data is directly passed to system commands or network functions.",
  "flows": "The code gathers dependencies from the 'Modules' directory and passes them to the setup process to compile extensions; there are no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard setup routines without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a straightforward setup process for a Python package, using standard practices to include source files and link against system frameworks. It dynamically lists modules in a directory and configures compilation options. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script for PyObjC framework bindings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python framework extension, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily reads local files and prepares a package for installation, with no external untrusted data or network activity involved.",
