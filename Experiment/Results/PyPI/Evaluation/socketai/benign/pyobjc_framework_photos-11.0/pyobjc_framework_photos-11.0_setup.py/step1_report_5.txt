{
  "purpose": "This code sets up and configures a Python package wrapper for the macOS Photos framework using PyObjC. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the use of the Photos framework in Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory to list module dependencies (`os.listdir('Modules')`), and accesses environment variables for sys.path modification.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted. External framework linking is performed via linker args.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a list of module dependencies from the filesystem and passes them to the build process, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard setup procedures without hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools and PyObjC. It dynamically lists module dependencies from a directory, specifies framework linking, and sets package metadata. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of os.listdir() to gather module files is typical for setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable leaks, or suspicious code are detected. The code adheres to conventional package setup patterns without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Python framework wrapper, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without suspicious operations.",
