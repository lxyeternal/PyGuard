  "purpose": "Verify that Photos.PHAdjustmentData is an Objective-C class in the Photos framework, ensuring compatibility with macOS 10.11+.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport, objc, and Photos frameworks; class declaration with version guard.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "The test checks the class type of Photos.PHAdjustmentData within a version guard, with no data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the Photos framework, then defines a test case that asserts Photos.PHAdjustmentData is an Objective-C class, guarded by a minimum OS version. No data flows, external communications, or malicious patterns are present. The code is a standard unit test verifying framework class existence, with no security implications. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign unit test verifying class existence in the Photos framework. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.",
