  "purpose": "A unit test class verifying the callable metadata of the Photos framework using a standard testing utility.",
  "sources": "Import of TestCase from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and the Photos module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "The test method calls assertCallableMetadataIsSane(Photos), which internally verifies metadata integrity without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test setup importing testing support and the Photos framework, then invoking a utility function to verify callable metadata. No malicious behavior, data leaks, obfuscation, or external interactions are present. The code's purpose is clear and standard for framework validation. All signals indicate benign intent, with no security risks or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying internal metadata of the Photos framework. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
