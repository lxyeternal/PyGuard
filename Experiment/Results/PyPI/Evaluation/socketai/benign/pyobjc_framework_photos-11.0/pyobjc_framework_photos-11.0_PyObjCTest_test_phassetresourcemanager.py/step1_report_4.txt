  "purpose": "Unit tests for Photos framework classes and methods related to asset resource management on macOS/iOS.",
  "sources": "Import statements for testing support and Photos module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; no network or file operations with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly unused byte string constant 'PHAssetResourceProgressHandler', no actual malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the Photos framework, then defines a test class with methods to verify method signatures and behaviors such as boolean flags and callback blocks. All methods appear to be standard API validations without any data processing, network activity, or system manipulation. The byte string constant is unused and appears benign. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward unit test code for framework validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for Photos framework API validation with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code is benign, focusing on method signature checks.",
