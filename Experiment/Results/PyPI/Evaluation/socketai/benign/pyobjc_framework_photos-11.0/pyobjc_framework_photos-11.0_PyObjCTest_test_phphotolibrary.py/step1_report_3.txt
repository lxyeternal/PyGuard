  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Photos framework bindings, verifying enum types, constants, protocols, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools, objc, and Photos modules; method calls on Photos class and related objects.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; primarily static assertions and method signature checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Code primarily tests framework interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit tests on Photos framework bindings, confirming enum types, constants, protocols, and method signatures at different OS and SDK levels. It uses assertions to verify the existence and correct behavior of methods, including argument types and return values. There are no signs of data manipulation, untrusted input handling, or network activity. The structure and content are consistent with typical testing code for framework bindings, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests verifying the correct binding of the Photos framework API. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for validation purposes.",
