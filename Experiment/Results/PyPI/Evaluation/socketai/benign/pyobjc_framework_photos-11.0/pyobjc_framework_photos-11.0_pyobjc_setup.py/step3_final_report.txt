  "purpose": "Build, test, and package setup script for PyObjC framework wrappers, performing system info collection, environment detection, and dynamic test loading.",
  "sources": "System commands ('sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'), file I/O for SDK info, environment variables, filesystem for test modules.",
  "sinks": "Writing build info files, modifying sys.path and sys.modules, dynamic import of test modules, subprocess calls for system info.",
  "flows": "System commands and environment variables influence SDK detection and build configuration; test modules are loaded dynamically based on filesystem patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads or network activity. Use of subprocess and environment variables is standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical build and test setup routines for macOS Python extensions. It relies on subprocess calls to system utilities for environment info, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The reliance on environment variables and external commands introduces minimal risk but is common in such scripts. The code is well-structured, readable, and aligns with expected practices for build automation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and test setup tool with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects typical environment reliance but does not indicate malicious activity.",
