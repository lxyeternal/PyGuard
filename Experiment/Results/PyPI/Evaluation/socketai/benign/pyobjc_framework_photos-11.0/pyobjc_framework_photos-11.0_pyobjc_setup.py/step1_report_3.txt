{
  "purpose": "The code sets up and configures the build, installation, testing, and packaging process for the PyObjC framework, including custom build commands and environment management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., PATH, CFLAGS, SDK paths), subprocess outputs (e.g., sw_vers, clang version), file system (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, header files), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess outputs for system info, file I/O for SDK and header info, modifications to sys.path and sys.modules, and executing build commands.",
  "flows": "System info collection (via subprocess) influences build configuration; environment variables and SDK detection affect compilation flags; custom commands modify sys.path and install behaviors; test suite execution reports results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs standard build system tasks, with extensive environment and SDK detection, and custom command definitions, which are typical for build scripts. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages build and testing procedures for a Python extension framework. It dynamically detects SDK versions, configures compiler flags, manages sys.path for testing, and customizes build commands. All subprocess calls invoke system utilities for system information, not malicious payloads. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. The code relies on standard modules and system commands, and there are no indications of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup and build configuration script for a Python extension package. It includes environment detection, build customization, and testing routines, all consistent with legitimate development practices. No malware or malicious activity identified.",
