  "purpose": "This script sets up and manages the build, testing, and packaging processes for the PyObjC framework wrappers, including handling dependencies, SDK configuration, and test suite execution.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls to 'sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun', and 'sw_vers' for system info; file reading for plist and SDK details; environment variables for compiler and SDK paths; and dynamically imported test modules.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess outputs used for system information; file writes for build info and SDK version; dynamic imports and test executions; environment variable manipulations for compiler configuration.",
  "flows": "System commands retrieve system info and SDK paths; file operations read SDK details and write build info; environment variables influence compiler selection; imported modules execute tests and load SDK configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads identified. Use of subprocess for system info retrieval is standard, but reliance on system commands and environment variables could be manipulated if compromised. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution present. The code performs system queries and file manipulations in a typical build context.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs system queries, file I/O, and build/test management with standard Python modules. Subprocess calls fetch system and SDK info, which are typical in build scripts. The environment variables and system command invocations are used for configuration and setup. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The import statements, dynamic test loading, and SDK handling are consistent with normal build tooling. The use of subprocess, plistlib, and environment inspection is standard and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a build and test automation tool for PyObjC. It does not exhibit malicious intent or behavior. All system interactions and file manipulations are typical for such a context. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected.",
