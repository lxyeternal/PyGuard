  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AST transformation visitor with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It is safe for use, with a low security risk primarily due to its extensibility allowing user-defined transforms. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The confidence in this assessment is high (~0.9)."
