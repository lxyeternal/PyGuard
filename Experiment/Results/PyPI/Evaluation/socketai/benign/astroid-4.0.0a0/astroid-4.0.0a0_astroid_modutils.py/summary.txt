  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for Python module and path management. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk stems from the use of dynamic imports, which could be exploited if external input is untrusted, but no such input is present here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2."
