  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating and loading Python modules, checking module paths, and managing source files, primarily for static analysis or import resolution.",
  "sources": "os.walk, os.path, sysconfig, importlib, sys, environment variables, user input via filenames",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module, importlib.util functions, os.path.exists, file operations, dynamic path manipulations",
  "flows": "Module name strings or filenames flow into importlib functions or path resolution functions; paths are checked for existence; module specifications are retrieved",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib functions with dynamic module names could be exploited if external input is uncontrolled, but no direct untrusted input handling is evident; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscated code; extensive path manipulation is standard for import resolution; no backdoors or secret exfiltration code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements module loading, path normalization, and source file resolution. It uses standard Python libraries for import management and filesystem checks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only potentially risky aspect is dynamic import of modules via importlib, which is a normal pattern but could be exploited if user-controlled input is passed unsanitized—however, no such input handling is visible here. The code's structure and logic appear consistent with benign static analysis and module management tasks. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for module and path management with no malicious intent. It is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and performs expected operations related to Python module resolution. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
