  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating and analyzing Python modules, files, and paths, mainly for internal use in a static analysis or import handling context.",
  "sources": "Reading module names, filenames, directory listings, environment variables (e.g., sysconfig paths, sys.builtin_module_names), and file existence checks.",
  "sinks": "Importing modules, loading modules from names or files, checking file existence, normalizing paths, and determining module types and locations.",
  "flows": "Sources of module names or filenames (e.g., load_module_from_name, load_module_from_file, get_source_file) flow into functions that resolve paths, check for __init__.py, or import modules; potential untrusted data can influence module importing and path resolution.",
  "anomalies": "Standard library paths are dynamically obtained; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; no suspicious domain or network activity present; functions are mainly for filesystem and import resolution with caching.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with filesystem operations, module import resolution, path normalization, and module metadata extraction. It relies on system paths, environment variables, and importlib utilities to locate and load Python modules and packages. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The use of importlib and filesystem checks is typical for import handling and static analysis tools. The only minor concern is the use of warnings.warn about deprecation and handling of paths, which is benign. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, security-conscious utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility library for Python module and path management, used for static analysis or import resolution tasks. It does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It operates with system paths and importlib functions in a standard way. Confidence in security risk assessment is high; no malware suspected; obfuscation is not evident.",
