  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for module/path management, static analysis context.\n- **Findings:** Uses importlib, filesystem checks, path normalization. No malicious code or obfuscation. Dynamic imports are standard but could be misused.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a legitimate utility module. No malware or malicious intent detected. The suppression of errors during import could hide issues, but this is a common pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). Justified given the potential misuse of dynamic import but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions for module and file handling.\n- **Findings:** Standard filesystem and importlib operations. No suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard utility code with low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0-0.2. The report suggests 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Module and source file management.\n- **Findings:** Uses importlib, filesystem checks, caching. No malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Typical utility functions, no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Module handling, import resolution.\n- **Findings:** Uses importlib, filesystem, caching, output capture. No malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Standard pattern, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Module/path utilities for static analysis.\n- **Findings:** Uses importlib, filesystem, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Typical utility code, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. The code performs dynamic imports but in a controlled, standard manner without any malicious payloads or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation or hidden code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, mainly due to the potential misuse of dynamic import functions, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — The code is a standard utility module, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slight risk if used improperly, but nothing suspicious in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and justified. The core functionality is safe and standard for module management utilities. The potential for misuse exists but is inherent to dynamic import patterns, not malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
