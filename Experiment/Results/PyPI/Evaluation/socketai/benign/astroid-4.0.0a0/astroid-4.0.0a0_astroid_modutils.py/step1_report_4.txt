    "No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns found.",
    "No obfuscated code, encrypted payloads, or suspicious dynamic code execution found.",

  "analysis": "The script is a utility module for managing Python module loading, path normalization, and source file detection. It employs importlib for dynamic importing, which inherently executes module code but is a standard behavior. The code captures output during import to prevent pollution of logs or reports. It performs path and file existence checks to locate modules and source files. The code also maintains a cache for path normalization to optimize performance. No suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets, network connections, reverse shells, or system modifications are present. The functions operate within expected parameters of a module management utility, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard utility library for Python module handling, with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. Its use of importlib and filesystem checks are normal for such utilities. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
