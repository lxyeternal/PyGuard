  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Python modules, paths, and source files, primarily for static analysis and module resolution.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations, environment variables, importlib functions, sysconfig paths",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module, spec.find_spec, filesystem checks",
  "flows": "Paths and filenames are normalized, then used in importlib functions to load modules or check files",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib functions that execute code during import; suppression of stderr/stdout during import, which could hide errors but is standard in such utilities",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utilities for module and source file management, with functions that perform dynamic imports, path normalization, and filesystem checks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of importlib can execute arbitrary code if provided with malicious sources, but the code itself does not contain such payloads. The suppression of output during import is a common pattern to prevent error noise. Overall, the code is a legitimate utility module with low inherent security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for Python module and path management. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk stems from the use of dynamic imports, which could be exploited if external input is untrusted, but no such input is present here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2.",
