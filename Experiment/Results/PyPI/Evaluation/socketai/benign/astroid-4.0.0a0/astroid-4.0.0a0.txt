      "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, benign initialization script for a static analysis tool. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are justified, and the slight risk score of 0.1 in the last report reflects the benign cache hack, which does not pose a security threat."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AST transformation visitor with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It is safe for use, with a low security risk primarily due to its extensibility allowing user-defined transforms. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk. The confidence in this assessment is high (~0.9)."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for Python module and path management. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk stems from the use of dynamic imports, which could be exploited if external input is untrusted, but no such input is present here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2."

All reports correctly identify it as such, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose and implementation are straightforward and safe."
