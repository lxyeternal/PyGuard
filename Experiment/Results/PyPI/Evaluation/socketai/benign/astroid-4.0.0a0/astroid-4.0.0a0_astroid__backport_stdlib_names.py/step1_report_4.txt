{
  "purpose": "This code provides a backport for sys.stdlib_module_names for Python versions earlier than 3.10, defining sets of standard library modules for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python version information from sys.version_info and imports sys.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading Python version info, then assigning a frozenset of module names based on the version, with an assertion to ensure correct Python version handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code is purely for compatibility and version checking.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module and defines frozensets of standard library modules for Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, intended to support older Python versions lacking sys.stdlib_module_names. It uses version info to select the appropriate set and raises an assertion if used outside Python 3.9. There are no code injections, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors present. All code appears to be legitimate and for compatibility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign backport utility for managing standard library module names across Python versions. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
