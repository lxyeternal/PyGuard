{
  "purpose": "This code provides a backport for sys.stdlib_module_names for Python versions earlier than 3.10 by defining a set of standard library modules available in various Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads Python version information from sys.version_info and constructs a frozenset of module names based on that version. It also imports the sys module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data processing in this code. It only performs a version check and defines a set of module names.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing sys, checking the Python version, and assigning a set of module names accordingly. There are no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is purely for compatibility purposes and contains static data.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it imports sys, defines sets of module names for different Python versions, and raises an error if run with an unsupported version. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It simply supports compatibility and has no external communication or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving a compatibility function without any malicious or suspicious elements. It simply defines module name sets for specific Python versions. No security risks or malware detected.",
