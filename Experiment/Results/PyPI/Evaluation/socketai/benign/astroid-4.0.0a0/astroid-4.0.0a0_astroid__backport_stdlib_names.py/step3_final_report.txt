{
  "purpose": "Defines static sets of standard library modules for Python 3.7 to 3.9 to support compatibility in environments lacking sys.stdlib_module_names, with a version check restricting execution to Python 3.9.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version via sys.version_info and initializes large static frozensets of module names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; static data assignment with no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the version check enforces runtime restriction but does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, version-dependent assignment of module names for Python compatibility. It imports sys, checks the Python version, and assigns a predefined frozenset accordingly. If the version isn't 3.9, it raises an AssertionError. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The purpose is solely to support older Python versions lacking sys.stdlib_module_names. The code is well-structured, clear, and free of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static compatibility shim with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose and implementation are straightforward and safe.",
