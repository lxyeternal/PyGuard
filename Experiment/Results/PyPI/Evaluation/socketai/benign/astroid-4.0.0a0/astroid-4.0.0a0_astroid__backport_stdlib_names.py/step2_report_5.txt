  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: a static, version-dependent assignment of standard library module names, intended as a backport for Python < 3.10.\n- The code is static, no dynamic execution, no external inputs, no network activity.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The purpose is clear: compatibility, not malicious activity.\n- All reports agree on benign intent and functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code accurately defines module sets for Python 3.7-3.9, with a version check that raises an assertion if run outside Python 3.9. This aligns with the purpose of a backport shim.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **External data or inputs:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is static and straightforward.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or questionable claims?\n- No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, static compatibility shim with no security concerns.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code performs no malicious actions.\n- No obfuscation is present.\n- The static data and version checks pose no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are correct. The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring reflects this accurately.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n**Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis assessment aligns with the evidence and the code's purpose.",
