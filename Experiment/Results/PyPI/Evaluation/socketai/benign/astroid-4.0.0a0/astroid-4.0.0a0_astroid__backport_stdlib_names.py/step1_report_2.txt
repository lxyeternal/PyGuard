{
  "purpose": "This code provides a backport for sys.stdlib_module_names for Python versions earlier than 3.10, defining sets of standard library modules for Python 3.7 to 3.9.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info and defines large sets of module names as constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only defines static data structures based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "The code raises an AssertionError if run on a Python version other than 3.9, effectively preventing execution on unsupported versions; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines several large frozenset constants representing standard library modules for different Python versions. It then checks if the current Python version is 3.9; if so, it assigns the relevant set to a variable; otherwise, it raises an assertion error. The purpose is to provide a backport for sys.stdlib_module_names in older Python versions. The code contains no dynamic execution, external inputs, or data handling. It is purely static and self-contained, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, version-specific static data definition intended for compatibility purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The assertion ensures it only runs on Python 3.9, which aligns with its purpose as a backport utility.",
