{
  "purpose": "This script provides a backport of the 'sys.stdlib_module_names' attribute for Python versions earlier than 3.10, specifically for Python 3.7 to 3.9.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures defining sets of standard library modules for different Python versions; it also reads sys.version_info to determine the current Python version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data, nor do any untrusted data flows exist in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing sys, defining module sets, and then checking sys.version_info to determine whether to assign stdlib_module_names or raise an assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code uses static sets and straightforward version checks. The comment headers and licensing info do not contain suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward utility for backporting functionality absent in older Python versions. It defines sets of standard library modules for Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, and raises an assertion if the Python version is outside 3.9. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, external network calls, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The license comments and header are standard and do not contribute to malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign and solely serves compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim that conditionally assigns a list of standard library modules based on the Python version. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It functions solely as a version check and static data definition.",
