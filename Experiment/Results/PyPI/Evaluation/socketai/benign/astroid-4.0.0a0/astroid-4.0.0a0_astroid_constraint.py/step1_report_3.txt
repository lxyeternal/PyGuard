  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for analyzing constraints related to inference values in Python code, particularly for static code analysis involving 'is None' constraints and related logic.",
  "sources": "Code reads from input nodes such as nodes.NodeNG, nodes.Compare, nodes.Name, nodes.Attribute, nodes.Const, and analysis of code structure via parent nodes and expressions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks such as network calls, file operations, or external data transmissions. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve matching and analyzing code expressions and AST nodes to determine if constraints like 'is None' or 'is not None' are satisfied, based on the structure of AST nodes and their relationships.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code solely performs static analysis and pattern matching on AST nodes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code does not contain dynamic execution or external system interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility that matches AST nodes representing constraints such as 'is None'/'is not None' and applies logical negations. It uses standard Python features, type annotations, and the 'astroid' library to parse and analyze code structures. The functions are designed to identify constraints in control flow constructs (if statements). No suspicious logic or malicious behavior is evident. It does not include any network, file, or system commands. Overall, the code appears to be a standard part of a static analysis tool without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for analyzing constraints in Python code, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs pattern matching on AST nodes to infer constraints and does not handle untrusted data or perform external actions.",
