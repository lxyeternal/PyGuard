  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for matching 'is None' constraints in Python ASTs. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score reflecting its safe, analytical purpose."
