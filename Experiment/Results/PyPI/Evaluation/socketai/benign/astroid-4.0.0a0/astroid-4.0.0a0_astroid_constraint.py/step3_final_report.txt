  "purpose": "Classes and functions for static analysis of Python AST nodes to identify 'is None' / 'is not None' constraints.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing variable names, attributes, constants, and comparison expressions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs static pattern matching without external data or side effects.",
  "flows": "Pattern matching from AST nodes to constraint objects, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'Constraint' with subclasses for 'NoneConstraint' that match specific AST comparison patterns. Functions analyze AST nodes to generate constraints based on 'is'/'is not' comparisons with None, using pattern matching helpers. The logic is straightforward, with correct handling of negation and pattern matching. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code is a standard static analysis utility, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for matching 'is None' constraints in Python ASTs. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score reflecting its safe, analytical purpose.",
