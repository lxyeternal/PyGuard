  "purpose": "Manage and build AST representations of Python modules and files, with caching and extension support.",
  "sources": "File reading via get_source_file, module name resolution via file_info_from_modpath, and zipimporter sources.",
  "sinks": "Loading modules from module names, importing from zip files, and caching modules.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (file paths, module names) are used to load and parse source files or zip resources, which are then converted into AST objects and cached.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of try-except blocks around module loading and cache lookups is standard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton-like pattern for managing AST representations, with functions to load modules from files, strings, modules, or zip archives. It includes mechanisms to cache loaded modules, handle import hooks, and reset caches. All operations are related to standard module handling, source reading, and AST construction, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code paths. The import hooks and cache invalidation could potentially be misused if replaced, but in this context, they are standard extensibility points. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation of an AST management system for Python modules, with caching and extensibility features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks.",
