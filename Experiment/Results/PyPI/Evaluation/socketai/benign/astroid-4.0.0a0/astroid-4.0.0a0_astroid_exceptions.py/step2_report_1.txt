  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe provided code is a set of custom exception class definitions for the 'astroid' library, which is used for static analysis and inference in Python code. The classes are well-structured, capturing relevant debugging attributes, and do not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The classes are standard Python exception subclasses with appropriate constructors and string representations.\n- **Malicious patterns:** No code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are evident; the code solely defines exception classes.\n- **Data flow:** No untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed insecurely.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- **Secrets or backdoors:** None present.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The exception classes include detailed attributes for debugging, which is standard and safe.\n- No dynamic code execution or external system interaction.\n- Exception messages are formatted with internal attributes; no user input is directly involved.\n- The license comments are standard and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code is purely class definitions; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0. Since no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, the overall risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is safe, legitimate, and intended solely for internal error handling within the 'astroid' static analysis library.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. It is safe for inclusion in supply chain considerations.",
