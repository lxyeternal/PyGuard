{
  "purpose": "Define various exception classes for handling errors in the astroid library, including syntax errors, inference errors, and module import issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input are read; the code defines classes and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into potential security vulnerabilities; exception classes only store internal error data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely class and exception definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated code. The license comments at the top are standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions used within the astroid library, including detailed constructors and string representations. There are no external inputs, no data processing, or network activities. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom error classes, with standard Python exception patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors are present. The code structure and content do not raise any security concerns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the astroid library, with no malicious or security-related issues detected. It serves to structure error handling internally within the library and does not pose any supply chain or security risks.",
