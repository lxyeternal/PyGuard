  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions used within the 'astroid' static analysis library.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data manipulation are present.\n   - The classes are standard Python exception subclasses, designed to carry debugging information.\n   - The license comments are standard and non-malicious.\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or backdoors are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The exception classes are well-structured, with appropriate constructors and string representations.\n   - The class hierarchy and attributes align with their purposes.\n   - No logical errors or inconsistencies are evident.\n   - The code adheres to standard Python exception patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.5 or below in all reports, which is reasonable since these are internal exception classes with no security impact.\n   - The detailed attributes and exception hierarchies serve debugging purposes without introducing vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely definitional, with no external inputs or outputs.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis confirms the absence of such issues.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n   - Given the nature of the code, a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified.\n   - The security risk remains at 0, aligning with the code's content.\n\n6. **Overall Security Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware.\n   - It is a legitimate component of a Python static analysis tool.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, since these are internal exception classes with no security implications)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and serves as internal error handling structures for the 'astroid' library. There are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation present.",
