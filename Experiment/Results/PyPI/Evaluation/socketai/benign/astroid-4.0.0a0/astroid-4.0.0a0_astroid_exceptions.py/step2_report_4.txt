  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exception classes for the `astroid` library.\n   - These classes serve for internal error handling, debugging, and reporting issues such as syntax errors, inference failures, import errors, etc.\n   - The implementation is standard, with constructors capturing relevant context attributes and string representations for error messages.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data manipulation is present.\n   - The code is purely declarative, establishing exception classes for internal use.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could lead to code injection, data exfiltration, or remote code execution.\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n   - Exception classes are a common pattern in Python libraries, especially for complex static analysis tools like `astroid`.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - Malware, obfuscated code, and security risks are all scored at 0 in each report.\n\n4. **Logical & Reasoning Checks:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes.\n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the scope of static class definitions.\n   - The attributes and methods are appropriate for debugging and error reporting, not for malicious activities.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n   - The code is legitimate, safe, and aligns with standard practices for error handling in Python.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No modifications or escalations are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, safe, and well-structured set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
