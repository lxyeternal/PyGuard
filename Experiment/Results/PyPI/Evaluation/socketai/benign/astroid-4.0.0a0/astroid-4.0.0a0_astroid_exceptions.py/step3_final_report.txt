{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive hierarchy of custom exception classes for the 'astroid' static analysis library, used for internal error handling, debugging, and reporting issues such as syntax errors, inference failures, import errors, etc.",
  "sources": "The exception classes capture internal attributes related to the state of the static analysis process, such as module names, error details, nodes, contexts, and inference results.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or external inputs processed by this code; it solely defines exception classes without performing any data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data flows; it only sets attributes within exception instances for debugging purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python exception class definitions with constructors that store relevant debugging attributes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The structure is clear, with appropriate inheritance and attribute handling. The license comments are standard and non-malicious. The exception classes are used internally within the 'astroid' library for error reporting, and do not process external or untrusted data. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected. The code is purely structural, serving as error handling constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate, and standard implementation of internal exception classes for the 'astroid' static analysis library. It poses no security or malware risk, contains no obfuscation, and is suitable for supply chain inclusion.",
