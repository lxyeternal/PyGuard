{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes used in the 'astroid' library for error handling and debugging purposes related to Python code analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily through exception instantiations, attribute access, and class initializations; no external input or untrusted sources are directly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data to external systems, networks, or files; it only raises exceptions and sets object attributes internally.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code mainly constructs exception objects with static or internal data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception class definitions. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are detected. No dynamic execution or external system calls are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for internal error handling within the 'astroid' library. All exception classes are designed to capture debugging information, such as module names, errors, nodes, context, and other relevant data, which are used internally for troubleshooting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data transmission, or security vulnerabilities. The code is primarily for structured error management, with no suspicious logic or behavior. Since it contains only class definitions and no runtime data processing or network operations, the likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions used for internal error reporting within a Python code analysis tool. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for debugging and error handling purposes.",
