{
  "purpose": "This module defines a hierarchy of exception classes used in the astroid library for static analysis and inference in Python code.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are read; the code only defines classes and functions related to exception handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; all data is used internally for exception handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no input or external data processing routines present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. It primarily consists of exception class definitions and their constructors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, with attributes related to parsing, inference, module import errors, and related issues within the astroid static analysis framework. All classes are standard Python exception subclasses with no dynamic code execution, external inputs, or suspicious patterns. The classes store metadata for debugging purposes but do not execute any untrusted code or perform network or system operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security-compromising behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class definition module for the astroid library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no indications of sabotage or malware. It solely serves as a foundation for error handling within the library.",
