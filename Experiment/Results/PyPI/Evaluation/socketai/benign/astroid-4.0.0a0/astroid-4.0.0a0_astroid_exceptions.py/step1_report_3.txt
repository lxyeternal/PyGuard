{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes used within the astroid library for static analysis and inference errors.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs are read; the code defines classes and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects are present; no sinks for data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class hierarchies and attributes, with no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes for error handling in a static analysis context. It includes detailed attributes to capture debugging information, but all are related to exception handling and do not perform any malicious actions or data manipulation. There are no inputs, outputs, or network communications. The structure is standard for defining exception hierarchies and does not contain suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the astroid static analysis library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
