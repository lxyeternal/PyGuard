{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes used within the astroid library for error handling and debugging.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and exception initializers in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data sources are not explicitly present; error messages and attributes could contain sensitive info if misused, but no direct data leakage mechanisms are implemented.",
  "flows": "Error objects are instantiated with contextual information and then converted to strings for messages; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks via these exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code only defines exception classes and constructors, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions related to the astroid library. Each exception class captures relevant debugging information through attributes. No code executes external commands, network operations, or manipulates data in an unsafe manner. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The structure appears standard for error handling within a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of structured exception class definitions intended for internal error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate, safe component of a Python static analysis tool.",
