  "purpose": "Define types, data structures, and protocols for static analysis and inference in the astroid library, used for Python code analysis and linting.",
  "sources": "Import statements (standard libraries and type checking), no data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code consists mainly of type and class definitions without data handling or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is mainly type annotations, class definitions, and protocol declarations, typical of a static analysis tool.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type annotations, TypedDicts, class protocols, and type variables used for static analysis in the astroid library. It includes imports, type definitions, and protocol interfaces. There are no input data sources, no data sinks, nor any dynamic or potentially malicious code behavior. The structure is typical for a codebase focused on type safety and inference logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard part of a static analysis framework, focusing on type definitions and protocols. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears to be safe and legitimate code meant for internal tooling purposes.",
