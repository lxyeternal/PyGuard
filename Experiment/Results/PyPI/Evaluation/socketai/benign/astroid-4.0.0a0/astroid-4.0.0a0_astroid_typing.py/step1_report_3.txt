{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations, data structures, and protocols for static analysis and inference within the astroid library, which is used for Python code analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, type annotations, and class definitions that do not process external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle external data inputs or perform output operations that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident; the code primarily establishes type structures and interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code consists solely of class and type definitions, with no dynamic or reflective behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of type annotations, data structures, and protocol definitions aimed at static code analysis and inference. It imports standard and library-specific modules but does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The focus on type hints and protocol classes is consistent with library internals, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard set of type definitions and class protocols for the astroid static analysis library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code’s structure and purpose do not suggest malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
