{
  "purpose": "This code defines type hints, data structures, and protocol interfaces for the astroid static analysis library, mainly used for code analysis and inference within Python codebases.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, class and function definitions, type annotations, and data structures such as dictionaries and lists.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially unsafe manner, such as executing code, writing to files, or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code defines data flows primarily for static analysis processes, passing inference results and configurations through function calls and data structures; no actual runtime data flow involving untrusted input is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard type annotations and interface definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, type annotations, and protocol interfaces for static code analysis. It imports necessary modules, defines data structures such as TypedDicts and Union types, and establishes protocols for inference and transformation functions. No runtime logic, data processing, or system interactions are present that could be exploited. The code appears to be standard library code for static analysis tooling, with no signs of malicious intent or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured component of a static analysis library with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as an interface and data structure definitions for other components of the system.",
