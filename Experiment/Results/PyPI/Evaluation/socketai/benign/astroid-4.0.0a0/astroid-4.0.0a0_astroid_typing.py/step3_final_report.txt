  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for static analysis within the astroid framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and type annotations used for internal tooling.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input/output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static type definitions do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDicts, Protocols, and class definitions intended for static analysis tooling. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard, well-structured, and serves as internal infrastructure. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate, and purely structural for static analysis. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
