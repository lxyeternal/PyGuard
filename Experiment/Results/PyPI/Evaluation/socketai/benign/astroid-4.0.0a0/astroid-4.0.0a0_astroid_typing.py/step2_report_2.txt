  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDicts, Protocols, class definitions, and import statements.\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying that the code is purely structural and used for static analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or external data handling.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - This is justified because the code is standard type and interface definitions with no malicious or dangerous behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; the code is not obfuscated or suspicious.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed analysis.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) across reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a set of static type definitions and protocols for a static analysis tool, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious constructs. The detailed reports support this conclusion, and the scoring aligns appropriately.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is legitimate, safe, and intended for internal tooling.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The analysis confirms the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
