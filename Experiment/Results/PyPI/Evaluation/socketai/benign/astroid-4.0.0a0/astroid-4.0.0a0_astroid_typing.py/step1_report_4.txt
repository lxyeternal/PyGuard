{
  "purpose": "This code defines types, classes, and protocols for managing and inferring properties of AST nodes in the astroid library, used for static code analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations, imported modules, and class definitions. No input or untrusted data is read during execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, network communication, or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "The code establishes type and class structures without dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be standard type and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures (TypedDicts), type aliases, and protocols for static analysis tooling. It imports standard modules and conditional typing imports for type checking. No runtime data input, output, or external calls are made. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The code serves as a foundation for AST inference operations and appears legitimate, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and class protocols used for static analysis in the astroid library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, and its purpose is purely for type safety and code structure management.",
