{
  "purpose": "The code provides base classes, inference utilities, proxies, and property detection functions for static analysis within the 'astroid' framework, facilitating Python code introspection and inference.",
  "sources": "Attribute accessors, decorator names, class and function definitions, inference result generators, class proxies, and property decorators.",
  "sinks": "Attribute lookups, inference result yields, class instantiations, and type representations; no external data or system calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as attribute access and decorator inference flow into inference generators and class proxies, with no external or malicious sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Usage of dynamic features like 'getattr' and inference generators are standard for static analysis tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured static analysis component involving proxies, attribute inference, class/type modeling, and property detection. It employs dynamic attribute access and inference mechanisms typical for such tools. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external influence are present. The data flows are internal, serving the purpose of code introspection and inference without external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate part of a static analysis framework, with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard patterns and internal data flows appropriate for its purpose. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; the overall security risk is negligible.",
