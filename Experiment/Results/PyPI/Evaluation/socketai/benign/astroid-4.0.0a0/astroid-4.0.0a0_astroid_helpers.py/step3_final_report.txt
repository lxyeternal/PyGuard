  "purpose": "Utility functions for static analysis, type inference, class hierarchy inspection, and object attribute inference within the astroid framework.",
  "sources": "Code nodes, inference results, class definitions, and attribute access points within the static analysis context.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; primarily operates on code structure and inference results.",
  "flows": "Inference functions process code nodes to determine types, class hierarchies, or object attributes without external or runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a deprecation warning in 'safe_infer' is benign; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static analysis utilities performing type inference, class hierarchy checks, length calculations, and attribute inference. No network activity, data exfiltration, or runtime execution of untrusted code is present. The functions operate solely on code structure and inference results, which are derived from static code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The deprecation warning indicates ongoing maintenance but does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of static analysis utilities with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its purpose.",
