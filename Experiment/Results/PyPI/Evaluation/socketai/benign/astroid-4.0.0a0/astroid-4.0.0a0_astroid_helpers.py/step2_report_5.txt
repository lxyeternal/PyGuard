  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the potential security implications, scores, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for static analysis, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to deprecation warnings)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe functions are typical for static analysis tools, handling type inference, class hierarchy, and object analysis. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The deprecation warning is standard maintenance info.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions for static analysis, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, standard static analysis functions with no signs of malicious intent. The deprecation warning is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for inference, class/object analysis, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warning)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nFunctions operate on code structure for static analysis, with no external or runtime malicious behavior. The deprecation warning does not impact security.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static analysis utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nStandard static analysis functions, no signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static analysis utilities, potential inference on untrusted nodes, but no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential handling of untrusted nodes, but still benign)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile some functions handle inference on nodes that could theoretically originate from untrusted sources, the code's purpose is static analysis, not runtime execution or data handling. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable, considering the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely static analysis utilities with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low (0.1), justified by the deprecation warnings and the nature of static analysis code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign static analysis utilities.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n### My personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (maintained for deprecation warnings and potential misinterpretation of inference on untrusted nodes, but overall very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard for static analysis, and carries no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
