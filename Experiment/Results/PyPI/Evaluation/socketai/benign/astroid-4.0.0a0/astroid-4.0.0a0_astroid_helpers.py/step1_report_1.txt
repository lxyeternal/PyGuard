  "purpose": "Utility functions for type inference, class and object analysis, and inference management within the astroid static analysis framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from astroid modules and standard library warnings, function parameters, and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data flows are present. The code primarily performs static inference and analysis.",
  "flows": "No data flows to external systems or network, primarily internal inference and type checking.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated warnings, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious API calls. Functions like 'safe_infer' warn about deprecation, but do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for static analysis, type inference, and class hierarchy inspection. It involves no network communication, file manipulation, or runtime code execution that could be malicious. The functions handle inference and type checks, which are typical for a static analysis tool. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of utilities used for static analysis and type inference within the astroid framework. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of deprecation warnings, which do not affect security.",
