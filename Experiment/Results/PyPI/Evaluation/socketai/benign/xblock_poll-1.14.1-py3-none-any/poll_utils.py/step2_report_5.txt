  "review": "Let's analyze this systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a set of utility functions and a dummy translation class, with no apparent malicious or harmful behavior.\n   - The functions are primarily sanitization (`remove_html_tags`, `remove_markdown_and_html_tags`) and a dummy translation class.\n   - The raw responses in the reports are all empty strings, which suggests no actual malicious payloads or suspicious code snippets are present in the responses.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - The reports only indicate \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n   - Since the responses are empty, there's no evidence of malicious code, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n   - The report's summary does not specify any findings, exploits, or malicious activity.\n   - Therefore, the reports seem to lack substantive evidence or analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Given the absence of any actual content or suspicious activity in the responses, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - Obfuscation score should also be **0**, as there's no indication of code obfuscation.\n   - Risk score should be **0** or very close to it, since no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are demonstrated.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Scores:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are observed, there is no justification for scores above 0.5.\n   - The reports do not provide any evidence to support higher risk or malware scores.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that \"Empty response\" might imply an issue, but without further context, it doesn't suggest malicious activity.\n   - The code itself is straightforward and does not contain suspicious patterns or payloads.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores should be consistent with the lack of evidence.\n   - Assigning any non-zero scores without evidence would be unreasonable.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports lack detailed findings, and the responses are empty, indicating no issues. Therefore, all scores should be zero.",
