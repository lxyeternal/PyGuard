  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content. Since the code provided does not generate or handle responses, and the reports contain no data, there is no evidence of actual issues or vulnerabilities in the code snippet itself. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for sanitizing HTML/Markdown and providing dummy translation functions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic**\n\n- The reports do not contain any actual response data, so there's no way to verify if the code produces issues or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are placeholders or empty, which suggests either an incomplete report or a lack of actual findings.\n- No indication of malicious activity, bugs, or security flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- Since no issues are described, any scoring should be minimal or zero.\n- The \"error\" is \"Empty response,\" which doesn't correspond to a security concern or bug.\n- Assigning high risk or malware scores based on empty reports is unreasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or risky behavior in the provided code or reports.\n- The code is simple utility functions; no external inputs are processed in a way that could cause security issues.\n- Therefore, risk scores should be close to zero unless new evidence emerges.\n\n**Step 5: Review malware score**\n\n- No malware activity is suggested or evidenced.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- Malware score should be 0.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports are empty; no claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- Without actual response data or evidence, assumptions about vulnerabilities are unfounded.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency of scores**\n\n- Since no issues are identified, scores should reflect that.\n- Assigning high scores would be inconsistent and unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears safe and straightforward.\n- **Issues reported:** None, due to lack of data.\n- **Scores:** Should be minimal (e.g., malware score = 0, obfuscated code = 0, risk score = 0).\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and empty reports, there is no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete. All scores should be zero or near-zero, reflecting no risk or malware detected.",
