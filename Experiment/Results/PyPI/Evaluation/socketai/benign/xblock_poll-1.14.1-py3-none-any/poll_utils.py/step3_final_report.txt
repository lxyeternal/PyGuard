  "purpose": "Utility functions for sanitizing HTML and markdown content, and a dummy translation service.",
  "sources": "Input data to remove_html_tags and remove_markdown_and_html_tags functions; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Sanitized output returned by functions; no untrusted data processing or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input data -> remove_html_tags or remove_markdown_and_html_tags -> sanitized output; no external flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with standard library usage and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides sanitization utilities and a dummy translation class. No network calls, response handling, or malicious payloads are present. The reports citing 'Empty response' do not relate to this code, as it does not generate responses or handle external data. The functions are safe, standard, and contain no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Given the lack of evidence, scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should be zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports are placeholders or misreports unrelated to the code's functionality. All security and malware scores are set to zero, reflecting a safe and non-obfuscated implementation.",
