  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports indicate \"Empty response\" with an empty string for `raw_response`. Since the code snippet does not show any function calls or processing of external responses, there's no direct evidence of a vulnerability or issue in the code itself based solely on these reports. \n\n**Step 2: Review the code for potential issues**\n\n- The code defines functions to sanitize HTML and markdown:\n  - `remove_html_tags()` uses `bleach` to strip all tags.\n  - `remove_markdown_and_html_tags()` converts markdown to HTML and then strips tags.\n- The code also includes a dummy translation class with no real functionality.\n\n**Step 3: Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**\n\n- The code appears straightforward and correct for its intended purpose.\n- No evident security flaw or bug in the functions.\n- The dummy translation class seems harmless and is a placeholder.\n\n**Step 4: Review the scores assigned in the reports**\n\n- All reports only mention \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- No scores are provided in the reports, only errors.\n\n**Step 5: Justify any high risk or malware scores**\n\n- Since no actual scores are provided, and the code is primarily sanitization and dummy translation, the risk and malware scores should be very low.\n- The functions do not perform any network operations, code execution, or file handling that could be malicious.\n- The only potential concern could be if the `markdown()` or `Cleaner()` functions are exploited, but given the context, they are used in a safe manner.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions**\n\n- The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, providing no actual response data or evidence of vulnerability.\n- Without concrete `raw_response` data, it's impossible to identify real issues.\n- The code itself does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- Since no actual issues are demonstrated, the scores should reflect minimal risk and malware potential, likely close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** No issues found.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent.\n- **Malware risk score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated code score:** Not applicable; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** or very close to it, given no evidence of issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, there are no indications of security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports seem to be placeholders with no actual response data to analyze. Therefore, I recommend setting all scores to zero, reflecting no risk or malware concern.\n\n**If actual response data or further context were provided, a more detailed analysis could be performed.**",
