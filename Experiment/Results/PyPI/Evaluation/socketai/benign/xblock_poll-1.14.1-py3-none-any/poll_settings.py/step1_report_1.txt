  "purpose": "Configure Django settings for the xblock-poll project, including internationalization and static files.",
  "sources": "Environment variable SECRET_KEY, YAML configuration file (poll/translations/config.yaml), imported modules os, yaml.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of SECRET_KEY from environment variable; reading from external YAML file (locale_config).",
  "flows": "SECRET_KEY from environment variable is used directly in Django settings; locale_config loaded from YAML file influences LANGUAGES configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Loading YAML with yaml.load() instead of safer yaml.safe_load() (although Loader=yaml.SafeLoader is specified, reducing risk). No other suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Django settings, loads a YAML configuration file for internationalization, and sets statici18n parameters. The SECRET_KEY can be set via environment variable, which is a standard practice. YAML loading uses yaml.SafeLoader, mitigating code injection risk. No hardcoded credentials other than the default SECRET_KEY, which is acceptable in a testing context. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard Django settings module with appropriate security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django configuration script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly handles environment variables and external YAML configurations with safety in mind. No malware or suspicious activities are detected.",
