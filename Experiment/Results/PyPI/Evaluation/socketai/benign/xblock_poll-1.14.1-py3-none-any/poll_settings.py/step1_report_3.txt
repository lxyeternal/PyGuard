  "purpose": "Configure Django project settings for the xblock-poll application, including security, localization, and static files.",
  "sources": "Environment variable SECRET_KEY, reading locale configuration YAML file.",
  "sinks": "yaml.load() function processing the locale configuration file.",
  "flows": "Locale configuration data flows from the YAML file to setting the LANGUAGES variable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() with SafeLoader is acceptable; SECRET_KEY is set from environment or default, which is common. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or hidden code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Django settings, loads configuration from a YAML file using SafeLoader, sets locale languages dynamically, and manages static files and internationalization. The SECRET_KEY is sourced from environment variables with a fallback, which is standard practice. No suspicious data leaks, code injections, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward configuration code with no malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django settings configuration with dynamic locale loading. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The use of SafeLoader for YAML loading mitigates potential YAML injection risks. Overall, it appears safe.",
