  "purpose": "Configure Django project settings for the xblock-poll application, including security, internationalization, and static files.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY'; reading 'poll/translations/config.yaml'; importing modules (os, yaml).",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY' used for security; reading a YAML configuration file which may influence language settings.",
  "flows": "SECRET_KEY sourced from environment variable; YAML config loaded from a local file influencing LANGUAGE_CODE settings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a default SECRET_KEY that is a hardcoded string, which could be insecure; YAML file loaded with 'yaml.load' using SafeLoader, which is appropriate; DEBUG mode is enabled, which is insecure for production; no validation of environment variables; reading configuration from local file without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Django settings with a hardcoded SECRET_KEY fallback, which is a security concern if used in production. Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY' is read to override it, but a default string is provided. Debug mode is enabled, indicating a non-production environment. YAML configuration is loaded using yaml.load with SafeLoader, which is safe from code injection. No suspicious or malicious code paths are evident. The code uses local files for configuration, which is typical and not malicious. Overall, no malicious behavior or sabotage is detected, but the insecure default SECRET_KEY and DEBUG mode should be addressed in production environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django settings file with no malicious intent. It uses a hardcoded default SECRET_KEY and DEBUG mode enabled, which are security risks but not malicious. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected. The YAML loading uses SafeLoader, mitigating YAML deserialization risks.",
