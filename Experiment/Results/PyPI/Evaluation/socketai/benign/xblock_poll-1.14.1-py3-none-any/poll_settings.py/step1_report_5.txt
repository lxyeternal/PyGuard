  "purpose": "Configure Django project settings, including security parameters, installed apps, internationalization, and static files.",
  "sources": "Environment variable SECRET_KEY; local YAML configuration file 'poll/translations/config.yaml'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of loaded YAML data to define LANGUAGES; environment variable SECRET_KEY used directly in settings.",
  "flows": "YAML file is loaded to define 'LANGUAGES', and SECRET_KEY is retrieved from environment variable with default.",
  "anomalies": "Using a default secret key in code; loading YAML configuration for locale settings without validation; no user input processing or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module. It loads SECRET_KEY from environment, with a fallback default value, which could expose secrets if not set properly. The YAML configuration file 'poll/translations/config.yaml' is loaded with 'yaml.load' using 'yaml.SafeLoader', which mitigates code execution risks during YAML parsing. The LANGUAGES setting is derived from YAML data, which, if manipulated, could lead to misconfiguration but not malicious behavior. No user input, network activity, or other insecure data handling is present. Overall, the code performs configuration tasks securely and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings module with proper YAML loading practices. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of default secrets and external configuration is typical, though care should be taken to ensure secrets are set securely in production. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
