  "purpose": "Configure Django project settings, including secret key, installed apps, internationalization, and static files.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY'), yaml.load from 'poll/translations/config.yaml', file reading of locale configuration",
  "sinks": "SECRET_KEY used in security context, YAML data used for setting language configurations",
  "flows": "Environment variable SECRET_KEY flows into SECRET_KEY variable; YAML file data flows into LANGUAGES configuration",
  "anomalies": "Use of a default SECRET_KEY value if environment variable is missing; YAML.load used with SafeLoader (safe), no obvious malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code loads the SECRET_KEY from environment or defaults to a hardcoded value, which is standard in non-production or testing environments. YAML configuration is loaded safely with SafeLoader, reducing risk of code injection. The code reads locale configurations and sets language options accordingly. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. Sensitive data like SECRET_KEY is handled properly with environment variable fallback, and no unsafe code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django settings with proper handling of external YAML configuration and environment variables. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors are detected.",
