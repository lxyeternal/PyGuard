  "purpose": "Django settings configuration for internationalization, static files, and secret key management, with YAML locale configuration loading.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY', YAML file 'poll/translations/config.yaml'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "SECRET_KEY sourced from environment variable or default; YAML loaded with SafeLoader; locale configuration used for setting LANGUAGES",
  "anomalies": "Use of default SECRET_KEY fallback, DEBUG mode enabled (not recommended for production), no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data securely with SafeLoader, handles secrets via environment variables, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs. The use of default SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True are security concerns but do not constitute malicious activity. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The overall structure is straightforward and standard for Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Django configuration script with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The main security issues relate to default secrets and debug mode, which are acceptable in testing environments but should be addressed for production. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
