{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package or module that imports specific classes from a local submodule related to polling or surveys.",
  "sources": "Import statements from a relative module (.poll) which may read data from other parts of the package, but no direct external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only performs import operations and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly composed of licensing comments, a version assignment, and an import statement. It does not execute any logic, handle input/output, or invoke functions that could be exploited. No malicious or suspicious activity is detectable. The imports are from local modules, which are part of the package structure, not external or suspicious sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a part of a larger package and contains only licensing and import statements.",
