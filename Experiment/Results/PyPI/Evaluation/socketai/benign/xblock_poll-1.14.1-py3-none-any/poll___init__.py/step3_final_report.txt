{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization component, providing license information, versioning, and importing local classes for further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments (license headers), a version string, and imports classes from a local module (.poll).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports local classes and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard license headers, version info, and local imports.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license comments, a version string, and an import statement from a local module. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The import from a local module (.poll) is typical for modular code and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, suspicious logic, or external data sources. The code is a standard setup for a Python module, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors detected. The high confidence scores (1.0) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores and assessments from the original reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
