{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up licensing information and import specific classes from a local module, likely part of a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable and imports classes from the local poll module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows or causes security issues.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code mainly initializes metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing comments, version assignment, and an import statement. It does not process external input, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code. The import statement is from a local module, indicating this is part of a larger, presumably benign project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign module initialization segment with no malicious or security risks detected.",
