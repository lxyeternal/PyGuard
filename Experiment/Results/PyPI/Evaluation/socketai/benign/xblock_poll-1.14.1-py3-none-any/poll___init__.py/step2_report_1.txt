  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a simple module setup with license headers, version info, and import statements.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted data are present.\n- The code appears to be standard open-source module boilerplate, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), and all indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The import from `.poll` suggests modular design but does not imply malicious activity.\n- The license header is standard for open-source projects and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware score: all reports are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: all reports are 0 or 0.0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Risk score: all are 0, reflecting no identified security issues.\n\n**Critical reasoning:**\n- There are no assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws.\n- The code is typical for a module's initial setup.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, the code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the actual content.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is simple, well-documented, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions provided in the reports.",
