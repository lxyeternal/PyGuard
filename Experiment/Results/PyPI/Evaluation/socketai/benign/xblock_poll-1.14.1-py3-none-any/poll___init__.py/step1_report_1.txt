{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a larger application, defining metadata and importing components related to polls and surveys.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as the module's version and imports from local modules (.poll). It does not read user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code segment; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks exists in this snippet; the code mainly sets up imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code consists of standard license headers, version info, and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license comments, version information, and import statements from local modules. There are no external data reads, no execution of dynamic code, no network operations, or other suspicious activities. The license header indicates open-source distribution under AGPL, but this is standard and not malicious. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is typical for an open-source project component.",
