{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a larger software package, likely related to polling or surveys, as indicated by the imported modules 'PollBlock' and 'SurveyBlock'. It serves as an initialization or module setup script.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data directly. The only data sources are internal module imports and the version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data processing or external communications are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are evident; the code only imports components and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The code is straightforward, mainly containing comments and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license headers, author information, and a version identifier. It imports two classes from a local module, indicating modular design. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic execution, network calls, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated content. It appears to be a standard, well-structured module file with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily serves as part of a larger application, with no suspicious or harmful operations detected.",
