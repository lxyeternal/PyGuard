  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license header and module import statements for a Python package, likely related to polling or survey functionality.",
  "sources": "The only source of data input is the module imports from .poll import PollBlock, SurveyBlock.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely imports classes and defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The code is standard for open-source projects with license headers and imports.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only license comments, author information, versioning, and import statements for PollBlock and SurveyBlock. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing logic present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident. It is a straightforward module initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard open-source module header and import file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
