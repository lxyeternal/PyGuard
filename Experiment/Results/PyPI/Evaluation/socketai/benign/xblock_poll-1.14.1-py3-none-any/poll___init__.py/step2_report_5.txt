  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Contains only license headers, author info, version string, and import statements from a local module (.poll).\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, external data, network activity, or data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be a typical module setup or initialization file for an open-source project.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** None. The code is straightforward and benign.\n- **Malicious activity:** None. No indicators of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security risks:** None evident in this snippet.\n- **Data flows:** None. No external data, input, or output.\n- **Obfuscation:** None. The code is clear and standard.\n- **Anomalies:** None. The code is typical for a module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the scores assigned:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is consistent.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, the scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since the code shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks, scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level is high (1.0), which is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on the code snippet provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe current scores are accurate and justified. The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
