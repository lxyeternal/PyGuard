  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports consistently identify the code as a simple module header with license comments, version info, and import statements from local modules (.poll). They emphasize that there are no data flows, external inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors. They all rate the code as benign with high confidence (1.0), and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The actual code provided contains only license headers, version string, and import statements (`from .poll import PollBlock, SurveyBlock`).\n- There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing.\n- The code is standard for an open-source module setup.\n\n**Errors or flaws in the report:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate given the code snippet. They do not overstate or understate the risk.\n- No errors are evident in the reasoning or conclusions.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- The scores assigned are all reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n\n- The reports assume the imported modules (`PollBlock`, `SurveyBlock`) are benign, which is reasonable given no evidence to the contrary.\n- Since the code only imports local modules and contains no dynamic or external data handling, the risk remains minimal.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments: the code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- If future code snippets or context reveal dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors, these scores should be revisited.\n- For this specific snippet, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues.",
