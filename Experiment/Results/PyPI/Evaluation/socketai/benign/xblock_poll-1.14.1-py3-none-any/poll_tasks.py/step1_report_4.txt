  "purpose": "Exports student answers to all supported questions in a course as a CSV file.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: block_id, course_id; Data retrieval via modulestore().get_item() and CourseKey.from_string(); Configuration via ReportStore.from_config()",
  "sinks": "ReportStore.store_rows() potentially writes data to disk; get_filename() may involve file I/O; prepare_data() fetches data for export",
  "flows": "block_id and course_id are used to retrieve content and generate filename; data from prepare_data() flows into store_rows() for storage",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no network operations; no data leaks observed; standard library functions used appropriately",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves an item from the modulestore using a provided block_id, converts course_id into a CourseKey object, and prepares data for export. It then stores the data using ReportStore. All operations appear to be standard data processing and file storage. No signs of malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The functions used are standard and do not exhibit suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard data retrieval and storage for course reports. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate export function with no malicious intent.",
