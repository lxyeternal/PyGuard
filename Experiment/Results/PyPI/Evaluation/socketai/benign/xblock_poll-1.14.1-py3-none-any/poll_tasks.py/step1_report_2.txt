  "flows": "block_id and course_id are used to retrieve data; data is prepared and stored via report_store.store_rows()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions; no dynamic code execution or data leaks detected",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves course content via modulestore() and usage keys, then stores data in a report store. No external network connections, no encryption bypass, or suspicious behaviors are observed. Usage of time and report storage appears standard for report generation. No malicious code or unusual behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate report generation task with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
