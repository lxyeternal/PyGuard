  "flows": "Input parameters (block_id, course_id) -> modulestore().get_item() -> src_block methods -> report_store.store_rows()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; use of time module is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves a course component using a provided block ID, extracts course info, prepares data, and stores it via a report store. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is evident. The report store uses a configuration name but does not show any hardcoded credentials or secrets. The functions appear straightforward and aligned with expected behavior for exporting data. No backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard data export task with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of an educational platform's reporting system.",
