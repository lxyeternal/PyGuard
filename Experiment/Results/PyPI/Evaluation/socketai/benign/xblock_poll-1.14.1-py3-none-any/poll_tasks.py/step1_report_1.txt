  "purpose": "Export student answers to CSV for a given course block",
  "sources": "import time, current_app, ReportStore, CourseKey, UsageKey, modulestore",
  "sinks": "report_store.store_rows (potential data storage), modulestore().get_item (data retrieval)",
  "flows": "block_id and course_id inputs → modulestore().get_item and CourseKey.from_string → store_rows in ReportStore",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no external network activity, no backdoors or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a task that retrieves an item from the modulestore based on block_id, constructs a filename, and stores data in a report store. The data handling appears to be straightforward data retrieval and storage with no evidence of malicious intent. No network communication or system modification is observed. The report store usage is based on configuration and does not indicate malicious data exfiltration or backdoor activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard data export task with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It uses established APIs to fetch data and save reports, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
