  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency, accuracy, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code, which performs data retrieval and storage for course reports.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, external network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal risk based on the described functionality.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), which seems reasonable given the consistent description.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code and its functions.\n- **Functionality:** The code retrieves course data, prepares it, and stores it—standard reporting behavior.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors are detected.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1–0.2) are reasonable.\n- The reports correctly do not assume vulnerabilities that aren't supported by the code.\n\n### Potential Improvements:\n- Since the code relies on external modules and configurations, it could be vulnerable if those modules are compromised. However, based solely on the provided code, no such vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if considering the reliance on external configuration ('GRADES_DOWNLOAD')—but without evidence of misconfiguration, current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to reliance on external configs and data handling, but no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Therefore, my overall estimates are:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code performs standard data export functions with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe based on the provided analysis.",
