  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the provided code and the details of each report.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports conclude that the code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or sabotage behaviors.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9–0.95).\n- Malware scores are consistently zero.\n- Security risks are rated very low (0.1–0.2).\n- No obfuscation detected.\n- The sources and sinks are typical for LMS plugins, involving resource loading, JSON handling, and event publishing.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The reports reference the exact classes and methods (e.g., `PollBlock`, `SurveyBlock`, JSON handlers, resource loading). These are present and consistent with the code provided.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** No signs of network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code uses standard Django and edX APIs, with no obfuscated or eval-based code.\n- **Resource Handling:** Uses `pkg_resources.resource_string()` and conditional static URL replacements, which are standard practices.\n- **Input Validation:** Proper validation in vote handlers, input gathering, tally updates, and export functions.\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Use of try-except for imports indicates environment flexibility, not malicious intent.\n- **Event Publishing:** Standard for LMS interaction tracking, not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score (0):** Fully justified; no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):** Justified; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk (0.1–0.2):** Slightly higher than zero but still very low, reflecting standard resource handling and validation practices.\n\n### Any inconsistencies?\n\n- The reports' assessments are consistent with the code. They do not overstate or understate the security posture.\n- The high confidence and low malware scores are justified.\n- The overall analysis aligns with the code's structure and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n- No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- Code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2**  \n- Slightly elevated due to resource handling and external URL replacements, but these are standard LMS practices, not vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional Justification:**\n\n- The code handles user data securely, with proper validation.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.\n- The resource loading and static URL replacement are typical and do not introduce security issues.\n- The event publishing and data export functionalities are standard and do not pose risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified**. The code appears secure, legitimate, and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with low-level, standard practices)\n\n**Note:** No evidence suggests any malicious or sabotage intent in this code. The overall security posture is very high.",
