{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple XBlock classes for implementing polls and surveys within an edX platform, supporting features like CSV export, vote management, and rendering views.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user module states, incoming JSON data via handlers, and resource files such as templates and scripts.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can potentially reach resource rendering functions, JSON responses, and event publishing, but there is no evidence of unsafe evaluation or data leakage outside intended flows.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs into JSON handlers and module states; votes and configurations update internal dictionaries; views render resources; export tasks handle CSV generation; event publishing occurs during voting and result viewing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. Usage of try-except for imports appears to handle environment differences, not malicious obfuscation. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is extensive but primarily standard for an edX XBlock implementation. It manages user votes, tallies, exports, and views securely, with validation of inputs and careful state management. External resource access is controlled via resource strings and resource loaders. No suspicious network activity or hidden backdoors are present. It handles import errors gracefully, indicating environment compatibility but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, well-structured implementation of poll/survey functionalities, with no malicious or sabotage behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and secure, designed for poll and survey functionality within edX, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows standard practices for data validation, resource management, and event publishing, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
