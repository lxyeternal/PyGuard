  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, logical consistency, and overall security posture.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard implementation of Poll and Survey XBlocks, handling user input, resource loading, and data export.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate and secure.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no malicious activity, and proper resource handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, well-structured code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard LMS poll/survey components, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no backdoors, no malicious payloads.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Typical poll/survey features, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure implementation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard handling of poll/survey data, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no suspicious external connections.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.1 in some reports, but generally low, reflecting standard security considerations.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, given the standard practices and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of polling and survey features within an LMS environment, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
