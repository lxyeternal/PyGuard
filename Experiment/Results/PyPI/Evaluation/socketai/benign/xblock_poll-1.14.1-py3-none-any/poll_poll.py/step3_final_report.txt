{
  "purpose": "The code implements LMS poll and survey components, handling user input, resource loading, event publishing, data export, and rendering of poll/survey interfaces.",
  "sources": "User input via JSON handlers, resource files (JS, CSS, templates), external modules (e.g., django, api_manager), and internal data structures (tally, answers, questions).",
  "sinks": "JSON responses, CSV files, event publishing, resource URL replacements, and HTML fragments for UI rendering.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user submissions to tally updates and event triggers; resource strings and templates flow into HTML fragments; export tasks generate CSV data; responses flow back to clients.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard LMS practices for poll/survey features, with proper validation, resource management, event publishing, and data export. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. Multiple independent reviews confirm the code's legitimacy, with high confidence and low security risk scores. The resource handling and validation mechanisms are appropriate, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent or sabotage. The assessments are consistent and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2). It is safe for deployment within an LMS environment.",
