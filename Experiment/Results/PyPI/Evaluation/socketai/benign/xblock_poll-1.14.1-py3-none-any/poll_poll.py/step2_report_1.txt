  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is legitimate, standard for edX, no malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.95.  \n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The low risk score reflects confidence that the code is safe. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code manages polling/survey data securely, with standard resource handling and no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous assessment. Slightly higher risk score (0.2) still indicates low concern, justified by the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is standard, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Handles data securely, with graceful error handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.  \n- **Assessment:** Again, consistent. No malicious signals or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** The code manages poll/survey data securely, with proper validation, resource handling, and no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.  \n- **Assessment:** The findings are aligned with previous reports.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is secure, with proper handling of user input, resource loading, and event publishing. No malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.95.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No, all are consistent and reasonable.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Risk scores:** They are low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, indicating strong certainty in the assessments.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, secure, and free of malicious intent or sabotage. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
