  "purpose": "A custom Airflow operator for interacting with GitHub API via dynamic method invocation, allowing flexible API calls based on parameters.",
  "sources": "User-supplied 'github_method' and 'github_method_args' parameters used in getattr to invoke GitHub SDK methods.",
  "sinks": "The getattr call acts as a sink where untrusted method names or arguments could lead to unintended SDK method execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('github_method', 'github_method_args') flow into the getattr call, which dynamically invokes the specified SDK method.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or whitelisting of 'github_method' or 'github_method_args'; reliance on user input without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a flexible SDK wrapper that dynamically calls methods on the GitHub client using 'getattr' with parameters supplied at runtime. While this pattern is common for extensibility, it introduces a potential security risk if inputs are untrusted, as malicious method names could invoke unintended SDK functions. The code handles exceptions gracefully and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The primary concern is the lack of validation for method names and arguments, which could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score is low (around 0.2) but should be mitigated by validating inputs against a whitelist to prevent misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and straightforward, functioning as a flexible API wrapper. The main security consideration is the dynamic method invocation without validation, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is detected. Implementing input validation or whitelisting would mitigate potential misuse. Overall, the code has a low security risk with no malicious intent.",
