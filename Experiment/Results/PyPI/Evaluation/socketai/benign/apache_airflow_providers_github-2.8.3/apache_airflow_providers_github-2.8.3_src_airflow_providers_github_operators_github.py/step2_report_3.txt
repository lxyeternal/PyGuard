  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue:** Use of `getattr` with user-supplied method name (`github_method`) without validation.\n- **Risk:** Potential for unintended method invocation if malicious input is provided.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, considering typical use cases.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the dynamic method invocation as a potential vector but notes that the code is standard and does not contain malicious payloads. The main concern is input trustworthiness.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the dynamic invocation with `getattr` and unvalidated inputs.\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher security risk (0.3) due to the possibility of invoking any SDK method.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis:** Reinforces the same point: the pattern is common but could be misused if inputs are malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue:** Same as above, dynamic method invocation with user-controlled parameters.\n- **Risk:** Moderate (0.3), considering potential misuse.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; the pattern is standard but requires cautious use.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue:** Same concern regarding dynamic method calls.\n- **Risk:** 0.2, low, assuming trusted inputs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent or payloads; the code is a typical SDK wrapper.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue:** Same as above, no validation of method names.\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The core pattern of using `getattr` with user input is consistent across reports. This is a known pattern in SDK wrappers but can be risky if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads in the code snippets or reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk scores:** They are generally low (0.2–0.3), which aligns with the fact that the pattern is common but should be used cautiously.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The main concern is the dynamic invocation via `getattr` without validation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. However, this pattern is often used intentionally for flexibility.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The code itself is standard, relying on trusted libraries, and does not contain malicious payloads.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but assuming controlled use, a moderate score of around **0.2** seems appropriate. If inputs are strictly validated or controlled, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe with no malware or malicious intent. The main security consideration is ensuring that method names and arguments are validated if they originate from untrusted sources.**",
