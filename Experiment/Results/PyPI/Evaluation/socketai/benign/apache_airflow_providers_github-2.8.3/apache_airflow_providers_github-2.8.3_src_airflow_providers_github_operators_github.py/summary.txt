  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and straightforward, functioning as a flexible API wrapper. The main security consideration is the dynamic method invocation without validation, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No malware or obfuscation is detected. Implementing input validation or whitelisting would mitigate potential misuse. Overall, the code has a low security risk with no malicious intent."
