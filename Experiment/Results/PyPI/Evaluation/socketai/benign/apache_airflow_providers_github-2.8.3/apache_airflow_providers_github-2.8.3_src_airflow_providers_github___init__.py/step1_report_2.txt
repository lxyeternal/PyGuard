{
  "purpose": "This code is part of an auto-generated Python module for the Apache Airflow provider, primarily responsible for defining the package version and validating the Airflow version requirement.",
  "sources": "Reads the Airflow version from the airflow module (__version__ attribute). Reads the version string (__version__).",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which could terminate execution but is not malicious.",
  "flows": "The code compares the parsed Airflow version against a specified minimum version and raises an exception if the condition is not met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the version comparison and error raising are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version parsing utilities, retrieves the current airflow version, and enforces a minimum version requirement by raising an exception if the requirement is not met. It contains no external inputs or untrusted data sources, no data leaks, and no suspicious code patterns. The code's primary function is environment validation. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation; the structure is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version check script used for dependency validation in an Apache Airflow provider package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
