  "purpose": "The code defines version compatibility checks for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring it runs with supported Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, packaging.version, and airflow.__version__; version string __version__",
  "sinks": "Runtime exception if version check fails",
  "flows": "airflow_version -> version comparison -> RuntimeError if version is too low",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward version check logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports version handling libraries and the current airflow version, then compares the base version of airflow against a minimum required version. If the airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError to prevent incompatible operation. No input from external sources is processed dynamically, no untrusted data handling, no obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version compatibility check for a Python package. It performs no malicious activity, has no suspicious or anomalous behavior, and is safe. It only enforces a version requirement and does not include any malware or security risks.",
