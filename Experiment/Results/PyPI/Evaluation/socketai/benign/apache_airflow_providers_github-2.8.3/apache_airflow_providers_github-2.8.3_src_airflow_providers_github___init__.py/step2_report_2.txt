  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: a straightforward version check that imports the airflow version, compares it to a minimum required version (2.9.0), and raises a RuntimeError if the environment does not meet this requirement.\n- The code is auto-generated, uses standard libraries (`packaging.version`), and performs typical dependency validation.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The logic is simple, transparent, and consistent with common practices for dependency enforcement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly performs a version check, parsing the current airflow version and comparing it to the minimum required version.\n- **Malicious code:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the code is purely for validation.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only \"risk\" here is that if the environment's airflow version is below 2.9.0, the script raises an exception, which could disrupt deployment or runtime. However, this is a standard and expected behavior for dependency validation, not a security issue.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.5 or higher? Given that the code enforces a version requirement, and failure to meet it halts execution, I would consider this a moderate risk (score ~0.5). However, since this is standard validation, I would assign a **risk score of 0.3** to reflect that it could impact functionality if the environment isn't compliant, but it's not inherently dangerous.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is purely for environment validation.\n- The only \"risk\" is operational, not security-related.\n- No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, standard, and non-malicious.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but I would slightly lower the **risk score to 0.3** to better reflect that it can cause operational issues but is not a security threat.\n- Malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (adjusted from 0.5 for operational impact but not security concern)\n\nThis code is a benign, typical version check with no security issues.",
