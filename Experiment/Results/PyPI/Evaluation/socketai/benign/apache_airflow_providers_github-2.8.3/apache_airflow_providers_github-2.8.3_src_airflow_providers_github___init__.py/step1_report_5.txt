{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated configuration or initialization script for an Apache Airflow provider package, primarily for version checks and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the airflow module (`from airflow import __version__ as airflow_version`).",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a control flow based on the version check.",
  "flows": "The version string obtained from airflow is parsed and compared to a hardcoded version '2.9.0'. If the condition is met, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The version check and import statements are standard and safe. The comments indicate auto-generated content and licensing details.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, imports the packaging.version module, and retrieves the current Airflow version. It defines a list of exported symbols (__all__). It performs a version check: if the installed Airflow version is less than 2.9.0, it raises an exception to prevent incompatibility. The logic is straightforward, based on version comparison, with no signs of malicious code or suspicious activity. The code is well-structured, comments clarify purpose, and no external data sources or untrusted inputs are used in a way that would introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign version check and initialization script for an Airflow provider package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. It simply enforces version compatibility for the package.",
