{
  "purpose": "The code performs a version check for the Apache Airflow package, ensuring the installed version meets the minimum requirement of 2.9.0, and raises an error if not.",
  "sources": "Reads the current airflow.__version__ and the imported packaging.version for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the version requirement is not met; no other data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Source: airflow.__version__; Sink: RuntimeError raised upon version mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, auto-generated, and performs standard dependency validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, retrieves the current airflow version, and compares it to a minimum required version. If the environment's version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError, halting execution. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. It is a typical dependency validation script. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The version check is a standard practice and does not constitute a security risk. The code's behavior is benign and intended for environment validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version validation script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's behavior.",
