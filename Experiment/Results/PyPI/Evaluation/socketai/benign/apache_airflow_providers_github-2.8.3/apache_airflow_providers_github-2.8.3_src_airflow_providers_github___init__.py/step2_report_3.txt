  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core functionality: importing the airflow version, comparing it to a minimum required version (2.9.0), and raising a RuntimeError if the environment does not meet this requirement.\n- The code is described as auto-generated, straightforward, and standard for dependency validation.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- The version check logic is typical and necessary for ensuring compatibility.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code does exactly what is expected for a version validation script.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code as described.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- They correctly identify the code as standard, safe, and not malicious.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports indicate any malicious behavior or security issues.\n- The only \"risk\" is the version check raising an exception, which is standard and not harmful.\n- Therefore, scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- No malware activity is suggested or observed.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, command execution, or data exfiltration.\n- Malware score should remain 0.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple, auto-generated version check.\n- No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The exception is a standard enforcement mechanism for dependency compatibility.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
