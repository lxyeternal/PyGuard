{
  "purpose": "This code is for initializing and version-checking an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with the installed Airflow version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported package versions (`airflow.__version__`) and the module's own version string (`__version__`).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data leaks, command executions, or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "The code parses the Airflow version and compares it to a minimum required version; if the version check fails, it raises a RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are observed. The version comparison and exception are standard for compatibility enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioning modules and performs a version check to ensure compatibility. It raises an exception if the installed Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a typical dependency check. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward, primarily for validation and standard package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version validation script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply enforces compatibility requirements.",
