  "purpose": "This code is part of a generated provider package for Apache Airflow, mainly used to define version checks and package metadata.",
  "sources": [
    "import packaging.version",
    "import airflow.__version__"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "raise RuntimeError"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "import packaging.version -> check airflow.__version__ -> raise RuntimeError if version is less than 2.9.0"
  ],
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic version comparison and a runtime exception to enforce version constraints. No suspicious code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, retrieves the current Airflow version, and compares it against a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the version is lower, it raises a RuntimeError with a specific message. The code is straightforward, generated from a template, and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation present. The only conditional operation is a version check that could disrupt execution if the environment does not meet requirements, which is expected behavior for dependency validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard version check and raises an error if the dependency version is inadequate. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a typical, safe, and transparent part of a package setup or validation process.",
