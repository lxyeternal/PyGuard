  "purpose": "This code segment contains only licensing comments and boilerplate information, serving as a license header.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code is purely comments with no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist due to the absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present; the code is standard license comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable statements, data flows, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign boilerplate with no malicious or security-related content. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The analysis confirms that this code segment poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
