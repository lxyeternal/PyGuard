  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is safe, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It notes proper handling of credentials, standard API usage, and exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, uses well-known libraries, and handles credentials securely. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Verdict:** The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and notes the credentials are managed securely. It assigns a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.2), which seems reasonable given the reliance on external credentials.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Evaluation:** The minor security risk score accounts for the fact that the token is stored externally and used for API access, which is standard but could be a vector if compromised. No issues found.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious behavior. It emphasizes proper credential handling and no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Evaluation:** The security risk score is consistent with the fact that the token is stored externally, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It emphasizes the straightforward, secure design.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Evaluation:** The zero security risk is justified, given the code's simplicity and proper credential management.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is deemed legitimate and safe, with no malicious behavior. Slightly higher confidence (1) and low security risk (0.1) reflect the standard credential handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Evaluation:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting the external handling of credentials. These are reasonable, considering the code's purpose and design.\n\n### My Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and maintainable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to reliance on external credentials stored in Airflow connections, which is standard practice but always warrants cautious handling.\n\n**Final notes:** The code is a standard, well-implemented GitHub connection hook for Airflow, with no malicious intent or security flaws detected. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
