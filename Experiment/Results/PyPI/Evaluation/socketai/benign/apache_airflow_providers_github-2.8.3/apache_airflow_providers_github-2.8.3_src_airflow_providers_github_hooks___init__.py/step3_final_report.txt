  "purpose": "This code snippet is a licensing header comment from the Apache Software Foundation, containing no executable code or data processing logic.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves serve as the source; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows, as the code contains only comments and no executable statements.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows exist, given the absence of code beyond licensing comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is purely licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a standard licensing header with no executable or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security threat, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign licensing comment with no security implications. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
