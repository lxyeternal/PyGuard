  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details for the 'apache-airflow-providers-github' package, including version info, integrations, hooks, operators, sensors, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external data input; static data returned by get_provider_info() function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external communications, data leaks, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The function returns static data; no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a function that returns a static dictionary containing package metadata. It includes version info, dependencies, and configuration for integrations. There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The file is marked as automatically generated, indicating it is a boilerplate configuration template. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. It adheres to standard coding practices and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static configuration file used for package metadata. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
