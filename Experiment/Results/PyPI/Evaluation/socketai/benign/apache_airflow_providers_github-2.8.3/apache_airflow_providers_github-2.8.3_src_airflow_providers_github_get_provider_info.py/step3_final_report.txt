{
  "purpose": "Provides static metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-github' package, including versions, integrations, hooks, operators, sensors, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static data hardcoded within the function.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data returned directly without processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function returning a hardcoded dictionary with package metadata. It is auto-generated, with no dynamic code, network operations, or external data inputs. The dependencies are version constraints, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is clear and standard for such metadata functions. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The static nature and lack of external interactions indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata provider with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
