  "purpose": "Provide metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-github' package, including versions, integrations, hooks, operators, sensors, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the get_provider_info() function, including hardcoded strings and version lists.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; function simply returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function that returns a dictionary with package metadata. It contains no input handling, no external calls, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be automatically generated, as noted in comments, and is purely declarative. All data is hardcoded in a structured format, and there are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static data provider with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is part of a larger codebase and serves as metadata. No security concerns are present.",
