  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration information for the 'apache-airflow-providers-github' package, including version info, integration details, hooks, operators, sensors, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources are read; the code primarily returns a static dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning a structured dictionary containing package metadata, versions, dependencies, and related info. It does not perform any I/O operations, data processing, or execution of untrusted code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious payloads are detected. All dependencies are version-restricted, and no potentially malicious code or network operations are present.",
