  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static function returning a hardcoded dictionary with package metadata.\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code, no network operations.\n- The file is auto-generated, indicating boilerplate code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- Dependencies are version constraints, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, auto-generated, and benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n- **Flaws:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, consistent and accurate.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- No flaws.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same conclusions as previous reports.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same as others, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- No flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and benign.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since code is straightforward and auto-generated.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code does not introduce any security risk.\n\n**Additional note:** Given the code's nature, even a conservative approach would not assign any higher scores unless new evidence emerges.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, static, and free of malware or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
