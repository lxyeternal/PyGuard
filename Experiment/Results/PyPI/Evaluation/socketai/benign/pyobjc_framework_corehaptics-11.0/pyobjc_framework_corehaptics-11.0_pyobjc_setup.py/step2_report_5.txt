  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a build/test setup for PyObjC, using subprocess calls for system info, no obfuscation or malware signs.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, considering reliance on system commands.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that subprocess commands are standard for system info retrieval. No suspicious activity or code obfuscation is evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard build/test routines, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by standard subprocess use.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious intent; subprocess calls are typical.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on build and test routines, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified, given environment and subprocess reliance.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that subprocess calls and environment reliance could be exploited if environment is compromised, but no malicious code is present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — matches the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering potential attack surface.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning correctly points out the potential risks but finds no actual malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard build/test routines, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the nature of subprocess calls and dynamic imports as typical.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1–0.2), justified by reliance on system commands and environment variables, which are standard in build scripts but could pose attack surfaces if environment is compromised.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a legitimate setup and testing script for the PyObjC framework.\n- It performs system introspection, environment configuration, and test execution via subprocess calls, which are standard for such scripts.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The potential security risk stems from reliance on environment variables and system commands, which is typical but warrants caution in compromised environments.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — low, justified by the reliance on system commands and environment variables, but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The provided reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate given the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
