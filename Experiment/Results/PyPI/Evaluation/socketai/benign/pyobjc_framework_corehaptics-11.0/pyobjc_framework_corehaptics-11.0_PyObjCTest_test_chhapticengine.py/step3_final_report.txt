  "purpose": "Static verification of CoreHaptics API constants, enums, and method signatures to ensure correctness and consistency.",
  "sources": "Framework constants, enum definitions, method signatures, and property assertions within the static test suite.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or external data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assertions and method signature checks without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and solely for validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite verifying constants, enums, and method signatures of the CoreHaptics framework. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data handling. The assertions confirm the presence and types of constants and method signatures, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The risk score is very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the static and benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static, straightforward structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static API validation suite with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
