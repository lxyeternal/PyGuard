{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the CoreHaptics framework, specifically testing constants, enums, and method signatures related to haptic engine control on Apple devices.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constants, enum types, and method signatures; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into dangerous operations; the code primarily verifies function signatures and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations based on external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code strictly consists of testing framework calls (assertions) and method signature verifications; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static checks on a framework's API, verifying enum types, constants, and method signatures to ensure correctness and consistency. It does not execute any untrusted code, nor does it process user input or external data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is purely for validation and does not pose any security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard set of unit tests for a system framework, with no evidence of malicious intent or security threats. It merely verifies API correctness and constants.",
