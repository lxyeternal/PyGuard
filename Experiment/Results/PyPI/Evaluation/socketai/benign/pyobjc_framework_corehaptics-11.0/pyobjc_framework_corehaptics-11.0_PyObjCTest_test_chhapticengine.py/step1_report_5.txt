{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, used to verify constants, enum types, and method signatures related to haptic feedback on Apple platforms.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, constants, and method definitions within the CoreHaptics framework. It does not process external user input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "The code defines method signatures and handles for haptic engine events; no sinks related to untrusted data or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code sets up and verifies method signatures and constants; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code is structured as a test suite for API validation without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test class for the CoreHaptics framework, verifying enums, constants, and method signatures. It uses testing assertions to ensure API correctness across different SDK levels. No network access, file operations, or data handling involving untrusted sources are present. The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for the CoreHaptics API with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely verifies constants and method signatures relevant to haptic feedback on Apple devices.",
