{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, specifically testing constants, enum types, and method signatures related to haptic engine functionalities on Apple platforms.",
  "sources": "Imports modules CoreHaptics, PyObjCTools.TestSupport, and objc. Reads static constants, enum definitions, and method signatures from the CoreHaptics module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data are present; the code only defines and tests constants and method signatures without executing external or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code performs static assertions on constants and method signatures without runtime data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code strictly follows typical test patterns, defining and verifying constants and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, verifying enum types, constants, and method signatures across different SDK levels. It does not include dynamic data processing, network operations, or any code that could be malicious. All code is static and aimed at validation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and benign test suite verifying the API surface of the CoreHaptics framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No malicious intent or security concerns are identified.",
