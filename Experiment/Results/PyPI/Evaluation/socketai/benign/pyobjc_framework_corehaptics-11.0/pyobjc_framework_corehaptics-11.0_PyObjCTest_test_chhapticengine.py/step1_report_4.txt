{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, verifying constants, enums, and method signatures in the API.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constants, enum types, and method definitions from the CoreHaptics module, which are provided by the framework and not user input.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "The code performs assertions on framework constants and method signatures, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observed. The code primarily consists of test assertions on the framework's API signatures and constants.",
  "analysis": "The script is a unit test for the CoreHaptics framework, checking enum types, constant values, method signatures, and callback block types. It uses predefined framework constants and method signatures to ensure correctness. There are no indications of data input handling, network activity, or execution of dynamic or malicious code. The code does not process external data or user input, nor does it perform any system modifications or network communications. All interactions are limited to static API verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for API validation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain suspicious behaviors or malicious code segments.",
