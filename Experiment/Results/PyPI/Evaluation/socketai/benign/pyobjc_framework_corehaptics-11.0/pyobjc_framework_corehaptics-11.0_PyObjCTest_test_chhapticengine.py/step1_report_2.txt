{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for the CoreHaptics framework, specifically testing constants, enum types, method signatures, and behaviors of the CHHapticEngine class on macOS/iOS.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from the CoreHaptics framework constants, enum types, and method signatures. It does not process external or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or output to external systems. The code is solely for testing framework interfaces and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to sinks. The code simply verifies method signatures, constants, and enum types without executing any data processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard framework testing methods and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite that checks the existence and types of constants, enum values, and method signatures related to the CoreHaptics framework. It does not execute any potentially dangerous code, make network connections, or process untrusted input. All functions are related to framework validation, and no malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit testing suite for the CoreHaptics framework's CHHapticEngine class. It only verifies constants, method signatures, and enum types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
