{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test for the CoreHaptics framework, specifically testing the types and constants related to haptic events on macOS/iOS.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported CoreHaptics module and test support functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks information.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling assertions to verify the types and constants of the CoreHaptics module, which does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with standard testing assertions and conditional checks based on SDK levels.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework (CoreHaptics) and uses test support utilities to verify that specific constants are of the correct type and exist at certain SDK levels. The tests are benign, focusing on type assertions and constant existence. No data input, external communication, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code is well-structured, simple, and standard for framework validation, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign unit test for the CoreHaptics framework's constants and types. It poses no security threat, does not contain malware, and exhibits no suspicious behavior.",
