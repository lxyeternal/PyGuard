  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CoreHaptics framework, specifically testing enum types and constants related to haptic events.",
  "sources": "Imports from CoreHaptics module and test framework",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs assertions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward test code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports the CoreHaptics module and performs unit tests to verify that certain enums and constants are correctly typed. The tests are restricted to framework constants and do not process untrusted data or perform external operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard testing code for a framework's API integrity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test module for verifying API constants and enum types in CoreHaptics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. The code's purpose is purely testing and validation.",
