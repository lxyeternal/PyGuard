{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, specifically testing enums and constants related to haptic events on macOS/iOS.",
  "sources": "Imports CoreHaptics module, which provides access to haptic feedback functionalities, and PyObjCTools for testing support.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs assertions on constants and enum types, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a native macOS/iOS framework for haptics, then runs type assertions to verify enum types and constants for SDK level compatibility. It uses standard testing practices with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or code injections. The purpose is clearly for compatibility and correctness testing of framework constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test verifying framework constants and types, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a standard testing suite for ensuring SDK compatibility.",
