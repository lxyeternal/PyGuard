  "purpose": "Unit testing for CoreHaptics framework constants and enums, verifying types and SDK levels.",
  "sources": "Import statements (CoreHaptics, PyObjCTools.TestSupport), test method definitions, assertions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; tests only verify types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system frameworks and testing utilities, then defines a test class with methods to verify enum types and constant values for specific SDK versions. All operations are standard assertions for type and value checks. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code solely performs harmless type verification within a testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test module verifying constants and enum types for CoreHaptics. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
