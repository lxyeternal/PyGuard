  "purpose": "Unit test code for verifying constants and enums in the CoreHaptics framework using Python's unittest structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from CoreHaptics and PyObjCTools for testing; no input data read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs assertions and type checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system frameworks and testing support modules, then defines a test case class that verifies enum types and constants in the CoreHaptics framework. The tests involve type assertions and runtime checks, with no dynamic execution of external data or hidden behaviors. The presence of SDK level checks is standard for conditional feature testing. Overall, the code is typical of a unit testing module for platform-specific features, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard unit test script for platform API verification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
