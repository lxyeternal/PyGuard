{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test verifying that CoreHaptics framework constants and enum types are correctly defined and typed, with SDK level considerations.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constants and enum types from the CoreHaptics module, and SDK level checks.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing constants and types to asserting their types and values; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static unit test verifying constants and enum types in the CoreHaptics framework. It performs no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The assertions are standard, and the code's purpose is purely validation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test for framework constants and types, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
