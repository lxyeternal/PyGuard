  "purpose": "Unit test for CoreHaptics module to verify callable metadata sanity.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing TestSupport from PyObjCTools and CoreHaptics module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system modification calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; test method calls assertions on imported module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and a core module, then defines a single test case method that asserts metadata sanity of the CoreHaptics module. The test performs a self-contained check without external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation. No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be standard testing code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit test script for verifying the integrity of the CoreHaptics module's callable metadata. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
