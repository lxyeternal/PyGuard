  "purpose": "Unit test for callable metadata sanity check in the CoreHaptics module",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport and CoreHaptics modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data usage observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code performs a test invocation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test code, no obfuscated patterns or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and the CoreHaptics module, then defines a test case that calls a method to verify metadata integrity. The structure is typical for a unit test and contains no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. It only performs a validation of the module’s callable metadata, which is a benign operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a sanity check on the CoreHaptics module's callable metadata, and nothing in the code indicates any malicious or harmful behavior.",
