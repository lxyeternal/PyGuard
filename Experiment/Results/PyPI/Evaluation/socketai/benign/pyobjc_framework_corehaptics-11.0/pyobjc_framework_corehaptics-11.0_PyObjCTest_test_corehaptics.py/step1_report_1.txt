  "purpose": "Unit test for the CoreHaptics module, verifying callable metadata integrity.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from PyObjCTools.TestSupport import TestCase, import CoreHaptics",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test method calls a validation function without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and the CoreHaptics module, then defines a single test case class with one test method that asserts the sanity of callable metadata in CoreHaptics. There are no dynamic code executions, no data leakage, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard unit test setup, focusing on internal validation without any network, file, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward unit test with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical testing code and contains no malware or security concerns.",
