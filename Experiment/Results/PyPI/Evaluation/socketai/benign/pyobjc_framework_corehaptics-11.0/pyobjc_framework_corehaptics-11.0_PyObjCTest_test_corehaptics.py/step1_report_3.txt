  "purpose": "Unit test for verifying callable metadata sanity in the CoreHaptics module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and CoreHaptics modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a test invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of import statements and a single test method calling an assertion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and the CoreHaptics module, then defines a test class with one method that asserts the sanity of callable metadata. The operation is a standard unit test pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No external data is read, no sensitive information is handled, and there are no obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign unit test for a Python module, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
