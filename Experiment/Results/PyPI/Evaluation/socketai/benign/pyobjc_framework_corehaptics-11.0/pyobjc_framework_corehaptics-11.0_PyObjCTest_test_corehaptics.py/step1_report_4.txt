  "purpose": "Unit test for CoreHaptics module metadata sanity check",
  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and CoreHaptics",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data flow to external systems or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flows; test assertions check internal metadata consistency",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and a native framework, then defines a test case that checks metadata sanity of the CoreHaptics module. It uses standard testing constructs without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The test appears to verify internal consistency only, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a native module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply performs a sanity check on the module's callable metadata, which is typical for testing frameworks.",
