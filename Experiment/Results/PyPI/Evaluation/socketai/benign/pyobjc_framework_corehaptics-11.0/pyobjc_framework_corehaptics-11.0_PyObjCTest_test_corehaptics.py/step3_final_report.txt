  "purpose": "A unit test verifying the internal callable metadata of the CoreHaptics module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and CoreHaptics; the call to assertCallableMetadataIsSane with CoreHaptics as argument.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The test method calls assertCallableMetadataIsSane on CoreHaptics, which internally verifies metadata consistency without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static unit test that imports testing support and the CoreHaptics module, then asserts the sanity of its callable metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The test is standard for internal validation of module integrity. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code's structure and purpose are clear, and the absence of anomalies indicates benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature and are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores accurately reflect its safe and standard nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
