{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for CoreHaptics device capabilities and attributes, verifying protocol adherence and method types.",
  "sources": "Imports of CoreHaptics, PyObjCTools, and objc modules; method definitions and return statements.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is being written to network, files, or external systems. No untrusted input handling or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines test cases and helper functions without external data flow or untrusted input sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. All methods return static values; no obfuscated or dynamic code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a test helper class and test case class for verifying protocol existence and method signatures related to CoreHaptics. It uses standard assertions for type checking and protocol existence, with no data processing, external communication, or potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward unit test setup for macOS/iOS CoreHaptics capabilities, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It is a benign testing script.",
