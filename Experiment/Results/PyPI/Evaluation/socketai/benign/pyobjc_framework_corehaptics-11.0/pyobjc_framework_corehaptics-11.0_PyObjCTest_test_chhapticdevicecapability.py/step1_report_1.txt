{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the CoreHaptics framework on macOS/iOS, specifically testing device capabilities and protocol adherence.",
  "sources": "Imports CoreHaptics, PyObjCTools, and objc modules; defines helper classes and test cases that interact with system frameworks.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not send data over the network, access environment variables, or perform file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; test methods invoke system API expectations and check method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected. The code strictly defines test cases and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test class setup for Objective-C bridging with PyObjC, testing protocol existence and method signatures for the CoreHaptics framework. Helper class methods return static values and verify method signatures. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code is consistent with testing practices and lacks any signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign test suite for system framework interfaces, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a legitimate, straightforward testing script without malicious intent.",
