{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test module for testing the capabilities and attributes of CoreHaptics device classes and protocols on macOS/iOS, using Objective-C bridge.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (CoreHaptics, PyObjCTools), class method returns, and test assertions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data; the code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly performs assertions and method signature checks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is standard unit testing for Objective-C bridging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for Objective-C classes and protocols related to CoreHaptics device capabilities. It defines helper classes with fixed return values, mainly for testing method signatures and protocol conformance. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor logic. It simply verifies expected behaviors of API methods.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing suite for Objective-C bridge classes, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a test helper without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
