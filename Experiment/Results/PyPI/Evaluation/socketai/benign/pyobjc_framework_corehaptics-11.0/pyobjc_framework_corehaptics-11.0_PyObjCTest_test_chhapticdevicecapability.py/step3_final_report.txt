{
  "purpose": "This code defines a helper class and a test suite to verify the existence of protocols and method signatures related to CoreHaptics device capabilities on macOS/iOS. It performs static assertions without executing external data or network operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads static method return values and protocol existence checks; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely for static verification.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling class methods to verify return types and protocol conformance; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow are present. The code is straightforward and standard for testing framework compliance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Objective-C bridging test suite that verifies protocol adherence and method signatures with static return values. It contains no network activity, data processing, or malicious logic. The consistent absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling indicates benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, reflecting the code's harmless, testing nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for system framework interfaces, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
