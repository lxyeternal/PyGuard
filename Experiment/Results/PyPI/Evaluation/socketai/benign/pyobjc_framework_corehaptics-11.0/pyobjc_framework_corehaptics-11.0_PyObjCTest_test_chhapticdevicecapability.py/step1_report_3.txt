  "purpose": "Unit tests for CoreHaptics framework capabilities, specifically testing protocol existence and method signatures.",
  "sources": "The code reads method return types and argument types, primarily within test assertions and helper class methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only verifies method signatures and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard testing and method signature validation are performed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class implementing methods returning static values and a test case class verifying protocol existence and method signatures. No external data is processed, and no dynamic or malicious behavior is observed. All operations are standard for testing framework validation, with no signs of obfuscated code, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for verifying framework protocols and method signatures with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
