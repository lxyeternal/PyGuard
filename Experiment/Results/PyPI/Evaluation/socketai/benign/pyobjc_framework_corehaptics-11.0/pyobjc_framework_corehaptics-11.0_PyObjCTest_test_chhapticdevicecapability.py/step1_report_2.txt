{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, testing device capability methods and protocol conformance on macOS/iOS.",
  "sources": "Imports from CoreHaptics, PyObjCTools, and objc modules; method return values and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Method calls returning static values; no untrusted data inputs, network communication, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily performs static assertions and method signature checks, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system frameworks and testing modules, defines helper classes with stub methods returning static values, and performs protocol and method signature assertions. All code serves a testing purpose with no input handling, no data processing, and no external communication. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, verifying protocol conformance and method signatures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It is safe and aligned with legitimate testing activities.",
