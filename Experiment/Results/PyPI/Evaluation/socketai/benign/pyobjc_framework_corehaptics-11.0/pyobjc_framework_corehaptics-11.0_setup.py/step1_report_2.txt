{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package wrapping the CoreHaptics framework on macOS, intended for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own file to insert the current directory into sys.path and imports setup from pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that handle untrusted data or user input; the code does not process external data or execute code based on untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The script imports a setup function and calls it with static parameters, with no dynamic data flows from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup task, modifying sys.path and importing a setup function to configure package metadata. It does not include code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond static configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code injection, or obfuscation. The purpose is clearly for package distribution, and the structure is standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a macOS framework wrapper. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and unremarkable from a security perspective.",
