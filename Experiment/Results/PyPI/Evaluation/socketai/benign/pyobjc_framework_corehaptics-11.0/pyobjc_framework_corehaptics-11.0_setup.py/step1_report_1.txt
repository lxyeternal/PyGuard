{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pyobjc-framework-CoreHaptics package, used to wrap the CoreHaptics framework for macOS.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and pyobjc_setup; reads the current directory path; reads environment variables related to installation requirements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processed or passed to external systems.",
  "flows": "The script reads the current directory, modifies sys.path, and uses setup() to configure package installation with specified dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for a package. It modifies sys.path, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The dependencies are versioned and relate to the PyObjC framework, which is legitimate. No indication of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration for a Python package wrapping macOS framework, with no malicious or security risks detected.",
