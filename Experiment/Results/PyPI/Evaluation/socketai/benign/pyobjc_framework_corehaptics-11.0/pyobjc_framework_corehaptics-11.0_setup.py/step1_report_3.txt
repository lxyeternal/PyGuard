{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure the Python package 'pyobjc-framework-CoreHaptics' for macOS, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the module's __doc__ string, os.path.dirname(__file__), and version string; importing setup from pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or potential security risks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard setup script with dependency specifications.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports necessary modules, defines package metadata, and calls setup() for package configuration. No code executes untrusted data, no input parsing, and no network or file operations that could be malicious. The dependencies are versioned, and the code relies on external setup tools without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
