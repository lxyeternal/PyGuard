{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python wrapper for the CoreHaptics framework on macOS, intended for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the file system (__file__), environment variables (via sys.path), and package dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "targets": "No clear targets for untrusted data processing or data leakage; no external data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Imports from __file__ and sys.path influence module loading; dependencies are specified for installation but do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up the environment for packaging a Python module, modifying sys.path for module discovery, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies. It does not include any network communication, data processing, or code execution outside standard setup procedures. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident. It is a straightforward packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script for wrapping the CoreHaptics framework; it does not contain malware or malicious behaviors. It is a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
