{
  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-CoreHaptics' framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Standard modules 'os' and 'sys'; static import of 'pyobjc_setup'; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, file writes, or external communications.",
  "flows": "Static import and configuration data flow; no source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python setup script that imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and calls setup() with static parameters. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All dependencies are versioned explicitly, and the structure aligns with typical packaging scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
