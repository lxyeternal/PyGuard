{
  "purpose": "To set up and install the pyobjc-framework-CoreHaptics package for macOS, providing Python bindings for the CoreHaptics framework.",
  "sources": "Reading the __doc__ string, importing os, sys, and pyobjc_setup, and defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not handle untrusted input or data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup process is straightforward and does not process external input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard libraries and a setup utility to configure package installation. It sets the package name, description, minimum OS level, package list, version, dependencies, and long description. There are no input validations, network calls, or system modifications that could indicate malicious intent. The code is consistent with typical Python package setup scripts. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping the CoreHaptics framework on macOS. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe and serves the purpose of package installation configuration.",
