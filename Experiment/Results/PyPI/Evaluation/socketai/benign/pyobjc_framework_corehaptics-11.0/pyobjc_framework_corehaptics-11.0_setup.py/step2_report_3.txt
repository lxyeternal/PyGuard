  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward Python setup script for packaging a macOS framework wrapper.\n- The code only imports standard modules and a setup utility, then calls setup() with static parameters.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, code execution, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- The dependencies are versioned and legitimate.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- **No flaws detected.** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script with no security issues.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, justified by the absence of any malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are 0, which is justified.\n\n### Malware scoring:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions. The reports' malware scores are correct.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is based on static code review.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the current reports and is appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
