  "purpose": "Unit testing for CoreHaptics framework constants and methods, ensuring correct types and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports CoreHaptics module, uses assertions on module constants and method signatures.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are used; tests focus on internal constants and method signatures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; testing static constants and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code solely performs assertions on constants and method signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework, performs assertions to verify types and method signatures at different SDK levels. No external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation are present. The purpose is to verify API constants and method signatures for compatibility, with no indications of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite verifying framework constants and method signatures. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code appears safe and intended for compatibility testing.",
