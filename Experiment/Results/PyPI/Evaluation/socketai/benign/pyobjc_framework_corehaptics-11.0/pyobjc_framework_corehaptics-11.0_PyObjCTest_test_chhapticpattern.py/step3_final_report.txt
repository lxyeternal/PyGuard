{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite verifying constants and method signatures in the CoreHaptics framework, primarily for API validation and SDK compliance.",
  "sources": "Imports CoreHaptics module, accesses class attributes, and calls methods with out parameters for validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; assertions are on static constants and method signatures only.",
  "flows": "The code performs static assertions without data flow from untrusted sources; no external input or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and solely for validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static type and signature checks on the CoreHaptics framework constants and methods, conditioned on SDK levels. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or suspicious code. The assertions confirm expected types and method argument attributes, indicating a benign validation script. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API validation suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of zero malware and obfuscation, and a very low risk score, accurately reflect its benign nature.",
