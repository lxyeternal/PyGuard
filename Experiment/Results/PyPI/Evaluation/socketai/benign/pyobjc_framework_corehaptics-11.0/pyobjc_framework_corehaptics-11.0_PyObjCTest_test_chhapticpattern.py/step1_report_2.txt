  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CoreHaptics framework, verifying constants and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Constants and method declarations within the CoreHaptics module, including class initializations and attribute checks.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data source to sink flows observed; the code mainly asserts types and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The code only performs type assertions and method signature tests; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a system framework (CoreHaptics) and tests various constants and methods for expected types and signatures at different SDK levels. The code uses assertions to verify enum types and method parameters, which is standard for testing. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The logic is straightforward and solely focused on validation, with no input processing or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard unit test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and primarily verifies framework consistency across SDK versions.",
