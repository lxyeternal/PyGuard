{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the CoreHaptics framework, validating constants, enums, and method signatures related to haptic pattern handling on Apple platforms.",
  "sources": "Import statements for CoreHaptics and testing modules; usage of CoreHaptics constants and methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in the code; the code only performs assertions and method signature validations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling assertion methods on CoreHaptics constants and methods to verify their types and signatures, without passing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is structured as a standard unit test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework (CoreHaptics) and testing utilities. It defines test cases that check whether certain constants are of string type and whether specific methods have the expected argument types (out parameters). All operations are read-only assertions; no data is being read from external sources or written to external destinations. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears to be a legitimate validation suite for the CoreHaptics API, ensuring compatibility and correctness across SDK versions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign test suite verifying API constants and method signatures in the CoreHaptics framework. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
