{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for the CoreHaptics framework, specifically testing constants, enums, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports the CoreHaptics module and test support functions; no external data sources or user inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks, injections, or sensitive information processing observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only performs assertions on constants and method signatures; no data flow or execution flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. The code strictly performs type and signature validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework and performs type checks and method signature validations using a test framework. All assertions concern the types of constants and the presence of out-parameters in methods, conditioned on SDK levels. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious behavior detected. The code's purpose is to verify framework interfaces, not to perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for framework constants and method signatures with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It is safe and intended for validation purposes.",
