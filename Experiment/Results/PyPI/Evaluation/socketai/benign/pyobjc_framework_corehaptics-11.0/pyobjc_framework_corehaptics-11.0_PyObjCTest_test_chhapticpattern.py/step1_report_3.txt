  "purpose": "Unit testing module for CoreHaptics framework, verifying constants, enums, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from CoreHaptics and PyObjCTools.TestSupport; usage of class attributes and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as initWithEvents_parameters_error_, initWithDictionary_error_, exportDictionaryAndReturnError_, initWithContentsOfURL_error_ that involve out parameters and URLs.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; focus on method signatures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily consists of assertions and SDK version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite verifying the existence and types of constants, enums, and method signatures in the CoreHaptics framework. It includes SDK level checks and assertions for method argument attributes. No data processing, user input handling, or network activity is present. No suspicious or malicious code structures detected. The code appears to be straightforward testing code intended for API validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test suite for the CoreHaptics framework's constants and method signatures. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not process untrusted data nor perform any harmful actions.",
