{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for verifying the interface and behavior of CoreHaptics pattern player classes and protocols in macOS/iOS. It primarily performs protocol existence checks and method signature assertions.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, method signatures, and protocol declarations within the test suite. It does not include user input, network I/O, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. It only verifies method signatures and protocol conformance.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; the code merely tests interface properties and method signatures without executing logic or handling untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is structured as a typical unit test setup for Objective-C bridging and protocol verification.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system frameworks and defines a helper class with methods that mimic protocol methods, returning static values. It then defines a test case class that checks for protocol existence and verifies method signatures, argument types, and return types. All functions are for testing and interface validation purposes. There are no signs of malicious logic, data handling, or security risks. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard unit test suite for macOS/iOS CoreHaptics classes and protocols. It performs interface verification without executing any sensitive or malicious operations. There are no signs of malware or security threats.",
