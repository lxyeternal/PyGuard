{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the CHHapticPatternPlayer and related classes, verifying protocol conformance and method signatures in a macOS/iOS framework involving haptic feedback.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs; it primarily defines test methods and mock helper classes with static method returns.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks; no network, file, or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The code sets up method signatures and protocol assertions without actual data flow, so no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains placeholder methods returning static values, but no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Commented out code is benign and typical for test scaffolding.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward test suite verifying method signatures, protocol adherence, and return types for macOS/iOS haptic feedback classes. It uses mock classes with stub methods, and there is no indication of data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are detected. The code appears standard for a unit test environment, focusing on API compliance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test module for framework method validation without any malicious behavior or security risks. It only verifies method signatures and protocol conformance, with no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious logic.",
