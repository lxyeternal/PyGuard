{
  "purpose": "Verify that the error code constants in the CoreHaptics framework match expected values, serving as a correctness check in SDK testing.",
  "sources": "Static import of CoreHaptics module, referencing predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; assertions compare constants to expected values without dynamic data.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and asserts static integer values for known error codes, serving as a unit test for constant verification. It involves no data input, network activity, or dynamic execution. The assertions are deterministic and based on predefined constants, indicating a benign purpose. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistent with the code's static, safe nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying static constants in the CoreHaptics framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and accurate.",
