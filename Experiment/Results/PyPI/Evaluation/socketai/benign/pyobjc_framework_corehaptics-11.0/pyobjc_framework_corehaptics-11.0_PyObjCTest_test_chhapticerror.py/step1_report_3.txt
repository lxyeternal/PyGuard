{
  "purpose": "This code tests constants defined in the CoreHaptics framework for error codes related to haptic feedback on Apple devices.",
  "sources": "Imports from CoreHaptics and PyObjCTools.TestSupport, which are standard modules for interacting with system frameworks and testing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code accesses predefined constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and testing modules, then defines a test class that verifies the values of various error code constants in CoreHaptics. It performs straightforward assertions to ensure these constants hold expected values. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted data. The purpose appears purely to verify the integrity of system-defined constants, which is standard practice in testing frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite validating constant values in the CoreHaptics framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and serves a legitimate purpose within a testing environment.",
