  "purpose": "Test class for verifying constants in the CoreHaptics framework related to haptic error codes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for CoreHaptics and the test method accessing constants within CoreHaptics.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; the code only reads constants.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only reads and asserts constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly tests constant values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework and uses a test class to verify the values of predefined constants in CoreHaptics. It involves no data manipulation, user input, network activity, or dynamic execution. The assertions simply check for specific integer values associated with error codes, which is typical in testing scenarios. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward test case verifying predefined system constants. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. The code is safe.",
