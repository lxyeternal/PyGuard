{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite verifying constants related to CoreHaptics error codes for a macOS/iOS application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported CoreHaptics module, specifically constant values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only checks constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework module and performs assertions on predefined constant error codes, which are standard and static. No user input, external data, or dynamic behavior is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are observed. The code appears to be a standard unit test verifying static error code constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test case verifying predefined constants from a system framework. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks.",
