  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a straightforward unit test that imports system frameworks (CoreHaptics and testing modules) and asserts that predefined constants match expected integer values.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, execute dynamic code, or manipulate inputs.\n   - The purpose is to verify the integrity of static constants, a common and safe practice in SDK or framework testing.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - No evidence of data leaks, malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - No signs of malware, suspicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is static, deterministic, and only performs assertions on constants.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior, a score of 0.0 is appropriate. The purpose is purely validation of constants.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No reason to assign higher scores; the code is benign.\n\n5. **Additional Observations:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard unit test.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and purpose, I agree with the provided scores. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard unit test verifying static constants in a system framework. No malware, obfuscation, or security concerns are present. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
