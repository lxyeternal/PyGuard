  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward unit test verifying static constants from the CoreHaptics framework.\n   - The code only imports system modules and performs assertions on known constant values.\n   - No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation is involved.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - The code is purely for testing correctness of predefined constants, which is a common practice.\n   - There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The constants tested are system-defined error codes, not influenced by external or untrusted sources.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, but since there's no malicious or risky behavior, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n4. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The code's purpose is validation, not execution of any malicious or risky operation.\n   - The constant values are hardcoded and well-known, with no dynamic or external influence.\n   - The environment is a controlled testing context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying static constants.\n- No malicious activity, data leakage, or security risk exists.\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Security Risk   | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or risky operations identified.         |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are correctly assigned.**",
