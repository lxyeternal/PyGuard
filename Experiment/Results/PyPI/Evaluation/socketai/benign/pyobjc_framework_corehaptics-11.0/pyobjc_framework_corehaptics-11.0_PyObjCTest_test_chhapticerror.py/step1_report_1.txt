{
  "purpose": "This code defines a test case for verifying constants in the CoreHaptics framework, specifically error codes related to haptic feedback errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values from the CoreHaptics module to compare against expected error code integers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or inputs; the code only reads predefined constants and performs assertions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing the framework, accessing its constants, and asserting their values — no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and only performs standard tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a system framework (CoreHaptics) and tests the values of various error code constants to ensure they match expected integers. There is no user input, network activity, or data manipulation involved. The test simply verifies the correctness of constants, which is a common practice in unit testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test verifying constant values from a system framework. It contains no malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. It is a standard, safe testing script.",
