{
  "purpose": "The code tests constants related to CoreHaptics error codes for correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only accesses predefined constants within the CoreHaptics module.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or outputs that process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely for validation of constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior are present. The code strictly checks constant values without any dynamic or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a system framework (CoreHaptics) and performs assertions to verify the values of various error code constants. The assertions are straightforward, with no data manipulation, network activity, or code execution beyond validation. The code appears to be part of a test suite ensuring correct values of SDK constants. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for a unit test module for SDK constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test for validating SDK constants with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. It contains no suspicious or malicious code, no external data handling, and no malicious logic.",
