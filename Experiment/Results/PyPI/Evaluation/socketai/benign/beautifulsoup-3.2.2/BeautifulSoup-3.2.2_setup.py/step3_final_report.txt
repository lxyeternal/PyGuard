  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package, defining metadata and reading README and version info.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; imports '__version__' from 'BeautifulSoup' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration with no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads README and version, then passes metadata to 'setup()' function; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated import 'from BeautifulSoup import __version__'; package name 'BeautifulSoup' may be used for impersonation; no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The import of '__version__' from 'BeautifulSoup' is typical but relies on correct package structure. The package name 'BeautifulSoup' could be used maliciously for impersonation, but the code itself is benign. No obfuscation detected. The main risk is supply chain confusion due to package naming, not code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is the package name 'BeautifulSoup', which could be exploited for impersonation or supply chain attacks, but the code itself is safe.",
