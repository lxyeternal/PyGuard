  "purpose": "Retrieve AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment details, determine SSL usage based on load balancer port, and open the environment URL in a web browser.",
  "sources": "API calls to elasticbeanstalk.get_environment, elasticbeanstalk.describe_configuration_settings, elasticbeanstalk.get_option_setting, environment data env.cname",
  "sinks": "web browser opening via commonops.open_webpage_in_browser with env.cname URL",
  "flows": "API responses provide environment info → determine SSL setting → open URL in browser",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; straightforward API usage; no external code execution or data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with AWS SDK to retrieve environment configuration, checks load balancer port to decide SSL, and opens the environment URL in a browser. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling are present. The data flow is direct and based on trusted environment data. No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code performs a standard environment management task with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a legitimate AWS environment operation. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
