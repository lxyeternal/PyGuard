  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Retrieves environment info and configuration from AWS, then opens a webpage.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Opens a URL in a browser based on environment data.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Uses standard AWS SDK calls.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, legitimate, no malicious behavior, high confidence.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low risk).  \n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the URL is based on environment data and that no suspicious code is present.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, straightforward AWS SDK usage.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent with the code. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, similar in purpose, confirming no malicious patterns, no obfuscation, and legitimate API calls.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard deployment script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on the safety and benign nature of the code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, straightforward logic.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same overall conclusion: benign utility, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard utility that interacts with AWS Elastic Beanstalk APIs to retrieve environment info and opens a webpage accordingly.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.  \n- **Security Risk:** Very low, consistent with the reports.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at **0** across all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.  \n- Obfuscated scores are correctly at **0**.  \n- The security risk scores are appropriately low (around 0.1), reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No adjustments needed.",
