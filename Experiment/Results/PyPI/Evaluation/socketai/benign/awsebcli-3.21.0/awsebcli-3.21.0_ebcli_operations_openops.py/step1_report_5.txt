  "purpose": "To retrieve environment configuration from AWS Elastic Beanstalk and open a web page in the default browser with appropriate SSL settings.",
  "sources": "get_environment, describe_configuration_settings, get_option_setting",
  "sinks": "commonops.open_webpage_in_browser",
  "flows": "get_environment -> describe_configuration_settings -> get_option_setting -> open_webpage_in_browser",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or malicious code patterns, no suspicious data leaks or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code uses AWS Elastic Beanstalk SDK functions to retrieve environment details and configuration options. It then determines whether to open a webpage with SSL based on the load balancer's HTTP port setting. The process appears to be straightforward, with no data leaks, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior. The only notable aspect is that it automates opening a webpage based on environment configurations, which is a standard operation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for opening a web page associated with an Elastic Beanstalk environment based on its configuration. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
