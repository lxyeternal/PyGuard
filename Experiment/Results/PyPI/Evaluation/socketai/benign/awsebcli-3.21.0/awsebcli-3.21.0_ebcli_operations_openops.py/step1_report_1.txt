{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment settings and opens a webpage in a browser, potentially with SSL, based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads environment data from AWS Elastic Beanstalk APIs and configuration settings from the environment.",
  "sinks": "Opens a webpage in the default browser via commonops.open_webpage_in_browser() with a URL obtained from AWS environment data.",
  "flows": "Gets environment URL -> retrieves load balancer port setting -> determines SSL -> opens URL in browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with AWS Elastic Beanstalk to obtain environment information and configuration settings, then opens a URL in a browser. It uses external API calls and a function to open a webpage, which are standard behaviors. No data is leaked externally, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The function appears to perform legitimate operations related to environment management and user interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for opening a URL associated with an AWS environment based on its configuration. No malicious or security-compromising behaviors are detected. It is safe and intended for standard operational purposes.",
