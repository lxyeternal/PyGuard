{
  "purpose": "This code retrieves environment configuration from AWS Elastic Beanstalk and opens the application's URL in a web browser, with optional SSL based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (app_name, env_name); AWS API responses (get_environment, describe_configuration_settings, get_option_setting)",
  "sinks": "Opening a web browser with the environment URL; potential exposure if env.cname is untrusted",
  "flows": "app_name and env_name inputs -> AWS API calls -> retrieve environment details -> determine SSL setting -> open web page in browser",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code, no dynamic execution or obfuscation observed; reliance on external AWS services is standard",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with AWS Elastic Beanstalk APIs to fetch environment details and configuration settings, specifically checking the HTTP port setting. It then opens the environment URL in a web browser, applying SSL based on configuration. The data flow is straightforward: user inputs lead to AWS API calls, and the resulting environment URL is opened in a browser. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The URL is derived from AWS environment data, which is assumed trustworthy within the AWS context. No credentials or sensitive information is handled directly, and the operations are standard for deployment or management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate operations related to AWS environment management without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Overall, the script appears safe and benign.",
