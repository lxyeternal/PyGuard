  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for AWS Elastic Beanstalk and CloudWatch log management. No malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the filesystem operations but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal."
