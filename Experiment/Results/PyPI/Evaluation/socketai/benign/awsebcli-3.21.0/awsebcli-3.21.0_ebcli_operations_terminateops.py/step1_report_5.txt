{
  "purpose": "The code manages AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments and applications, including termination, deletion, and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment names, application names, configuration settings, application versions, and S3 bucket information from AWS APIs and local configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Deletes S3 objects, interacts with AWS APIs for environment and application management, outputs confirmation messages, and updates configuration files.",
  "flows": "Input data (environment/app names, configs) flows through API calls and functions, potentially leading to S3 deletions or environment manipulations based on user confirmation and API responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of standard AWS SDK and CLI interactions with no suspicious parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with AWS services through the 'ebcli' library, performing environment termination, application deletion, configuration cleanup, and S3 object removal. It uses standard libraries, and all interactions appear to be expected for an AWS management tool. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The functions include user confirmation prompts and manage resources securely. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The only noteworthy activity involves deleting S3 objects and managing cloud resources, which is typical for such management scripts and does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS Elastic Beanstalk management script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard resource management tasks securely and transparently, with proper user confirmation and error handling.",
