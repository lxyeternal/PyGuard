  "purpose": "Management functions for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments and applications, including termination, deletion, cleanup, and configuration checks.",
  "sources": "AWS API responses, user prompts, configuration settings, environment and application names.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK API calls for environment termination, application deletion, S3 object deletion, configuration updates.",
  "flows": "User inputs and AWS API responses influence subsequent API calls and resource modifications.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code follows standard resource management patterns without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with legitimate AWS SDK functions to manage environments and applications. It includes standard exception handling, user prompts, and resource cleanup routines. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is straightforward, performing expected operations without any hidden or suspicious code segments. The security implications are minimal, with potential operational risks if misused, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS resource management utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given its destructive capabilities if misused, but it does not indicate inherent vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
