{
  "purpose": "The code manages AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments and applications, including termination, deletion, cleanup, and configuration checks.",
  "sources": "User input is indirectly involved through parameters; external data is fetched via AWS API calls and environment/configuration descriptions.",
  "sinks": "AWS API calls such as terminate_environment, delete_application_and_envs, delete_objects, and describe_configuration_settings, which can affect cloud resources and data.",
  "flows": "Parameters such as env_name and app_name serve as sources; API calls and resource modifications are sinks; flows occur when these parameters are used in API requests to AWS services.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, credentials, or backdoors; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; standard use of AWS SDK functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment termination, application deletion, configuration cleanup, and checks for shared load balancers using AWS SDK functions. It includes user prompts and safety checks before destructive actions. No embedded malicious logic or hidden backdoors are present. The AWS API calls are typical for managing cloud resources, and no malicious data exfiltration or unauthorized system access code is detected. The only potential concern could be misuse of API permissions, but this is outside the code scope. Overall, the code appears to be standard management logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical management script for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments and applications, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It includes safe prompts and error handling, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
