{
  "purpose": "This code manages AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments and applications, providing functions for environment termination, application deletion, configuration cleanup, and load balancer inspection.",
  "sources": "Reads environment names, application names, configuration settings, application versions, and user confirmation inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to command injection if input is unsanitized (though not directly visible), and data leaks if environment or application details are exposed externally. Calls external AWS services and S3 buckets.",
  "flows": "Reads environment/application data from AWS, user confirmation prompts, and configuration settings; then performs AWS resource deletions and updates based on user and system inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard AWS SDK functions. No evidence of obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to interact solely with AWS SDK functions for environment and application management, with logical control flows for cleanup and deletion tasks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious data handling is evident. The confirmation prompts and cleanup functions follow typical procedures for resource management. No network or system data is exfiltrated, and no malicious actions are triggered. Overall, the code is consistent with standard AWS CLI management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard AWS environment and application management script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs expected resource management functions securely, without obvious security risks.",
