{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for displaying health dashboards for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments, including creating health-related tables and managing screen displays.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment configuration data retrieved via elasticbeanstalk.describe_configuration_settings() and environment options.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the terminal screen via methods like screen.start_screen() and screen.add_table(), which are user interface actions. It also logs debug messages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment configuration fetches (describe_configuration_settings) to health table creation, and then to terminal display functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. External data sources and outputs are standard for a status dashboard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily fetches environment configuration data and uses this to generate a terminal-based health monitoring display. The data fetched is used solely for display purposes and does not involve processing untrusted user input. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Usage of external libraries and methods appear standard and purpose-aligned. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, data theft, or sabotage. The only external interactions are with AWS SDK functions and terminal display functions, which are benign within this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS Elastic Beanstalk health dashboard display implementation. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The usage of external libraries and data sources appears normal for its intended purpose.",
