{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for displaying health information of AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments, including setting up data tables and starting health polling screens.",
  "sources": "Data is read from AWS Elastic Beanstalk via functions such as elasticbeanstalk.describe_configuration_settings and elasticbeanstalk.get_option_setting, which access AWS environment configuration data.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is used directly in security-sensitive operations, such as system commands, network connections, or file writes. No data is written or transmitted in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Configuration data fetched from AWS services flows into display setup functions to generate UI tables; no untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious code structures. Usage of AWS SDK functions appears standard. No dynamic code execution, external network connections, or credential handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for AWS environment health monitoring. It uses AWS SDK functions to retrieve configuration and status data, then sets up terminal UI screens with data tables. There is proper handling of different platform types and environment tiers. No indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious data handling are present. The code relies on external AWS SDK calls, which are typical for cloud management tools. The code's structure is clear and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, purpose-driven module for displaying AWS Elastic Beanstalk health information. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
