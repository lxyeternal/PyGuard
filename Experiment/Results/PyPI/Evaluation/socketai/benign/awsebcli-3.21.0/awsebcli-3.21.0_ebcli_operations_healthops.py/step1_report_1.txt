{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to display health information for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments interactively.",
  "sources": "Reads environment configuration data via elasticbeanstalk.describe_configuration_settings and elasticbeanstalk.get_option_setting; reads environment parameters such as 'PlatformArn' and 'SolutionStackName'.",
  "sinks": "Uses data to configure the display and polling mechanisms; no evident data leak or external data writing is performed.",
  "flows": "Environment data retrieved from AWS API calls influences the selection of health display methods and table structures. Data flows from AWS API responses to display components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard logging, API calls, and display logic. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and AWS-specific libraries to retrieve environment configuration for AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It then determines health display type (enhanced or traditional) based on environment settings. The functions create display tables for health metrics and request data, customizing columns based on platform type. All data sources are AWS API calls, and no external or untrusted input is processed. No data is sent over the network outside of AWS API interactions. The logic appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only potential concern is if AWS API credentials are misconfigured elsewhere, but this is outside this code's scope.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate component for displaying AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment health metrics. It performs standard API calls and display logic without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malware, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
