  "purpose": "The code is a CLI utility for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment health monitoring, retrieving environment configuration and displaying health metrics through terminal UI components.",
  "sources": "AWS SDK functions such as describe_configuration_settings and get_option_setting, which read environment configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Terminal display output via screen and table components; no external data transmission or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AWS SDK calls (sources) to display tables and UI components (sinks), with no untrusted data affecting system state or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment configuration retrieval and displays health metrics using standard libraries and AWS SDK functions. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is observed. The logic is clear, with no suspicious data flows or code patterns. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to AWS credential management outside this code scope. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign AWS CLI component for environment health monitoring. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided snippet and analysis.",
