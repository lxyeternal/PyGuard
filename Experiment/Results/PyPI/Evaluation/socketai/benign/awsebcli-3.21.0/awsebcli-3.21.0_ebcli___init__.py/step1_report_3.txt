  "flows": "No data flows are observable, as the code contains only a license comment and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a license header with no functional code; no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated content are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a version variable assignment. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could be exploited or contain malicious behavior. The presence of licensing info suggests it is part of a legitimate open-source package. No suspicious activity or malware signals are detected. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign license header and version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit any signs of malware or obfuscation.",
