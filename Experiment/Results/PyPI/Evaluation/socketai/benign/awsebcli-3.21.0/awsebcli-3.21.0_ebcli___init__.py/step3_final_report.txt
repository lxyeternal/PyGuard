  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing header with version information, providing metadata about the software package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from comments and the assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only static comments and a version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a licensing header with comments and a version string. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the content. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard licensing header with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are accurate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
