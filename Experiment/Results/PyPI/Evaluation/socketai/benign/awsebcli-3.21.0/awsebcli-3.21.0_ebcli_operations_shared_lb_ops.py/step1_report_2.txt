  "purpose": "This code manages user interactions for selecting shared load balancers and their ports in AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments, mainly facilitating load balancer selection and validation.",
  "sources": "User input via prompts (io.get_boolean_response, utils.prompt_for_index_in_list, utils.prompt_for_item_in_list), AWS API calls (elbv2.describe_load_balancers, elbv2.get_listeners_for_load_balancer), and parsing load balancer ARNs.",
  "sinks": "AWS API functions, especially describe_load_balancers and get_listeners_for_load_balancer, which access AWS resources; user prompt functions that accept user input for load balancer selection and port selection.",
  "flows": "User input prompts lead to conditional logic determining flow. Load balancer ARNs are parsed from strings, then used in API calls to describe resources. User responses influence which load balancer or port is selected. Data flows from user inputs into AWS API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code uses AWS SDK functions and user prompts. No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The parse_load_balancer_name function simply extracts a string segment. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script prompts users to select existing load balancers and ports, and validates provided load balancer names or ARNs. It uses AWS SDK calls to retrieve load balancer details, and relies on standard regex for validation. The flow is straightforward, primarily involving user interaction and API calls. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code. The code performs expected operations for load balancer management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard part of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI, facilitating load balancer selection and validation through user prompts and AWS SDK calls. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It is a benign utility script with typical API interactions and user inputs.",
