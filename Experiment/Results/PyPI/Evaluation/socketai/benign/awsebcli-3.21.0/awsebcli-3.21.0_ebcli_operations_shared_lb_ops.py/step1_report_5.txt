{
  "purpose": "The code manages customer prompts and interactions for shared load balancer configuration in AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments.",
  "sources": "User input via io.get_boolean_response, io.echo, utils.prompt_for_index_in_list, utils.prompt_for_item_in_list; external AWS SDK calls (elbv2.describe_load_balancers, elbv2.get_listeners_for_load_balancer).",
  "sinks": "Return statements, external AWS SDK calls that fetch load balancer ARNs, list processing functions.",
  "flows": "User responses influence selection of load balancer and port; AWS SDK functions retrieve load balancer data based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated or unnecessary dynamic code. Input/output handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates user interaction for selecting AWS load balancers and ports. It uses regex to validate load balancer names and makes API calls to AWS SDK (elbv2) to retrieve load balancer ARNs and listener information. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or hidden behaviors. The external SDK calls are standard for AWS resource management. Input prompts and output are straightforward and related to AWS resource configuration. No suspicious or malicious logic was found. The code does not handle or store sensitive credentials; it relies on AWS SDK for resource descriptions and user prompts for selection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI for managing load balancer configurations. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The external SDK interactions and user prompts are typical for this context. No security risks or malicious activities are detected.",
