  "purpose": "Functions to prompt user for shared load balancer selection, parse ARNs, validate load balancer names, and retrieve load balancer details via AWS SDKs for Elastic Beanstalk and ELBv2.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, AWS SDK API responses (list_application_load_balancers, describe_load_balancers, get_listeners_for_load_balancer)",
  "sinks": "AWS API calls and user prompts; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks beyond standard resource management",
  "flows": "User inputs trigger prompts; AWS SDK responses provide load balancer data; parsing functions process ARNs; validation functions convert names to ARNs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; straightforward AWS resource handling",
  "analysis": "The code manages load balancer selection and validation through AWS SDK calls and user prompts. It performs ARN parsing and name validation using regex. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The functions are standard for AWS CLI utilities, with proper input handling and resource description. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard AWS resource management tasks, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified. The scores are appropriate and do not warrant concern for supply chain security issues.",
