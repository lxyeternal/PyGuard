  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n- The code provides functions for:\n  - Prompting users to select shared load balancers and ports (`get_shared_lb_from_customer`, `get_shared_lb_port_from_customer`)\n  - Parsing load balancer ARNs to extract names (`parse_load_balancer_name`)\n  - Validating load balancer names and converting them to ARNs (`validate_shared_lb_for_non_interactive`, `get_load_balancer_arn_from_load_balancer_name`)\n- It uses AWS SDK calls (`elasticbeanstalk.list_application_load_balancers`, `elbv2.describe_load_balancers`, `elbv2.get_listeners_for_load_balancer`) to retrieve resource info.\n- User prompts are handled via `io.get_boolean_response`, `utils.prompt_for_index_in_list`, etc.\n- The code appears to be a utility for load balancer selection and validation within a CLI environment.\n\n**2. Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior:**\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n- No obfuscated code or backdoors.\n- Functions perform standard AWS resource handling, user prompting, and parsing.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n- The AWS SDK functions used are standard for resource management.\n- The logic is straightforward and consistent with expected patterns.\n\n**3. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with high confidence (0.9 to 1.0).\n- They correctly identify that the code is mainly user-interactive and calls AWS APIs for resource info.\n- No discrepancies or errors in the reasoning are evident.\n- The reports do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**4. Score Justification and Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** The reports assign 0.2, citing potential risks mainly due to user input and AWS API interactions. Given the benign nature, this seems reasonable.\n- **Overall:** The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**5. Critical Evaluation and Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard AWS CLI utility for load balancer management.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on user input and AWS SDK responses, but these are typical and not inherently risky.\n\n**6. Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0, given the benign nature, but 0.2 is acceptable considering user input and API interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Metric          | Score (0 to 1) | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**          | No malicious behavior detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**          | Clear, straightforward code.                                         |\n| Risk            | **0.1**        | Minimal risk; primarily user interaction and API calls.            |\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are appropriate, but I would recommend setting the malware and obfuscated scores to 0, and the overall security risk to around 0.1, reflecting the minimal inherent risk.",
