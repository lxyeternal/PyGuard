{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates the selection and validation of shared load balancers within the Elastic Beanstalk CLI, prompting users for input and parsing load balancer ARNs.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user responses via io.get_boolean_response and utils.prompt_for_index_in_list, as well as data fetched from AWS APIs like elasticbeanstalk.list_application_load_balancers and elbv2.describe_load_balancers.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include return statements passing ARNs and ports, as well as calls to io.echo for displaying prompts and responses.",
  "flows": "User inputs (boolean responses, index selections) influence control flow leading to API calls fetching load balancer ARNs or listener info; these values are returned or used for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Functions appear to perform standard AWS resource handling with user interaction. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for managing load balancer selection in a CLI context, including prompting users and parsing ARNs. It calls legitimate AWS SDK functions and performs typical validation and parsing without suspicious modifications. The logic is consistent with standard operations for load balancer management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures detected. It adheres to expected patterns for such CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard load balancer selection and validation functions for a CLI environment. No malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior is evident.",
