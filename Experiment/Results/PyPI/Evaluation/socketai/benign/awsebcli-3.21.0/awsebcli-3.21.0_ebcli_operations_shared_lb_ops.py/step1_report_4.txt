{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for managing shared load balancers in an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment, including user prompts for selecting load balancers and ports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include user responses from prompts (io.get_boolean_response, utils.prompt_for_index_in_list, utils.prompt_for_item_in_list), and AWS API calls (elbv2.describe_load_balancers, elbv2.get_listeners_for_load_balancer).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include return values (load balancer ARN, port number), which are passed to other AWS SDK calls or stored for further use.",
  "flows": "User inputs influence decisions on load balancer and port selection, with AWS API responses providing load balancer details. These are used to parse ARNs and identify load balancer names, then returned for subsequent use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code follows standard AWS resource handling and user prompting patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The only external interactions are with AWS APIs and user inputs, which are normal for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script securely interacts with AWS APIs to retrieve load balancer information and prompts the user for selections. It performs basic validation, such as matching load balancer name formats and parsing ARNs. The functions handle user interaction and AWS resource descriptions without any apparent malicious activity. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing load balancer selection within an AWS environment. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It relies on AWS SDK functions and user inputs, performing standard operations without suspicious patterns.",
