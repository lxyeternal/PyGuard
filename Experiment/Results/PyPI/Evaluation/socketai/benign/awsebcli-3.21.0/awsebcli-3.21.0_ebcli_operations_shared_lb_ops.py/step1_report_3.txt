{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates customer interaction with AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), specifically for shared load balancer selection and configuration in Elastic Beanstalk environments.",
  "sources": "User inputs via io.get_boolean_response and utils.prompt_for_index_in_list or utils.prompt_for_item_in_list; AWS SDK calls to elbv2.describe_load_balancers and elasticbeanstalk.list_application_load_balancers.",
  "sinks": "Return of load balancer ARNs; display prompts and lists; AWS SDK calls that could potentially leak info if misused; no direct untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "User input prompts determine which load balancer or port is selected, influencing subsequent AWS SDK calls that retrieve load balancer details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code uses standard AWS SDK and CLI interactions. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily user-interactive, prompting for load balancer selection and port choice, then retrieving AWS resource information via SDK calls. It parses ARNs to extract names and validates input formats with regex. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling observed. The AWS SDK usage appears to be standard, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or backdoors. The only potential concern is reliance on user input and AWS SDK responses, which are typical for such management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate AWS Elastic Beanstalk utility for managing load balancer configurations. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It operates within normal parameters of a CLI tool interacting with AWS services.",
