{
  "purpose": "This code orchestrates the composition of Elastic Beanstalk application environments, managing deployment workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as app_name, version_labels, group_name, nohang, and timeout; calls functions in commonops and elasticbeanstalk modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls external functions like wait_for_processed_app_versions, wait_for_compose_events, and compose_environments, which may involve network communication or system actions.",
  "flows": "Inputs (app_name, version_labels, group_name, nohang, timeout) → wait_for_processed_app_versions → compose_environments → wait_for_compose_events (if nohang is False).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Uses standard function calls and control flow. No data leaks or malicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code manages deployment orchestration by waiting for app version processing and then initiating environment composition through AWS Elastic Beanstalk APIs. It provides options for synchronous and asynchronous operation (nohang parameter). The functions use external modules for AWS interactions and logging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling detected. All inputs appear to be used for deployment management without harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate deployment orchestration script for AWS Elastic Beanstalk with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard API calls and control flow without hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations.",
