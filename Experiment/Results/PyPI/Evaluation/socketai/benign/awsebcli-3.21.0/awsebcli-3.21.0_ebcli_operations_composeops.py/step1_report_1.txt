{
  "purpose": "This code manages the composition and deployment of Elastic Beanstalk environments and application versions, primarily for orchestrating deployment processes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as app_name, version_labels, grouped_env_names, and group_name. It also calls functions that fetch environment status and compose environments.",
  "sinks": "Functions like wait_for_processed_app_versions, wait_for_compose_events, and compose_environments are invoked, which interact with AWS Elastic Beanstalk APIs to perform environment and application version operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) lead to calls to AWS API functions (sinks). The process flow involves waiting for app versions to be processed, then composing environments, and optionally waiting for compose events, forming source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. The code seems straightforward in orchestrating AWS deployment tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script orchestrates AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment composition, using well-defined function calls and waiting mechanisms. It does not handle or process untrusted data directly; instead, it relies on parameters passed externally. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Functions like wait_for_processed_app_versions and wait_for_compose_events are standard deployment waits, and compose_environments is a typical API call.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard deployment orchestration script for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply coordinates environment composition based on provided parameters. No malicious intent or malicious code is detected.",
