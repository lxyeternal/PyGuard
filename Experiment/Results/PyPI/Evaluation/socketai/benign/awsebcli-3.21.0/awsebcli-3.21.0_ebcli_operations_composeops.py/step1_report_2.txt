{
  "purpose": "This code manages AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment composition, orchestrating application version processing and environment updates.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (app_name, version_labels, group_name, nohang, timeout) and imported modules (elasticbeanstalk, commonops, io).",
  "sinks": "Functions that invoke AWS Elastic Beanstalk APIs (compose_environments), and output functions (io.echo).",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to functions which call AWS APIs, and output is printed via io.echo. The flow involves waiting for app version processing and environment composition requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard AWS SDK calls and control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily orchestrates AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment composition through function calls. It waits for application version processing, composes environments, and optionally waits for compose events based on user flags. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present. The API usage appears standard for deployment automation, and no data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors are evident. The functions rely on external modules for AWS interactions and do not include any suspicious logic beyond typical deployment procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward deployment orchestration tool for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages environment composition workflows securely using AWS SDK calls.",
