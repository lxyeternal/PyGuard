{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a deployment or management tool for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments, facilitating application composition and environment updates.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (app_name, version_labels, group_name, nohang, timeout), and external library calls (commonops.wait_for_processed_app_versions, elasticbeanstalk.compose_environments, commonops.wait_for_compose_events).",
  "sinks": "Function calls to external libraries (elasticbeanstalk.compose_environments, commonops.wait_for_processed_app_versions, commonops.wait_for_compose_events) which handle deployment operations; echoing messages via io.echo.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed by wait_for_processed_app_versions; then compose_apps calls elasticbeanstalk.compose_environments; subsequent wait_for_compose_events monitors deployment; user feedback via io.echo occurs during composition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures; no obfuscation or suspicious logic; standard AWS deployment pattern; no data leaks, code injections, or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to coordinate application deployment workflows in AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It waits for application versions to process, initiates environment composition, and optionally waits for deployment events. External library calls manage deployment actions and status checks. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are observed; code performs expected deployment orchestration tasks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical deployment orchestration script for AWS Elastic Beanstalk with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for managing application versions and environment updates. Security risk and malware likelihood are minimal.",
