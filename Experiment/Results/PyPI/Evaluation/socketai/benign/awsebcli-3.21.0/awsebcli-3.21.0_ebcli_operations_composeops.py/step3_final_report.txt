{
  "purpose": "The code orchestrates AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment and application version management, including waiting for app versions to be processed, composing environments, and optionally waiting for deployment events.",
  "sources": "External modules (`commonops`, `elasticbeanstalk`, `io`) performing AWS API calls and processing deployment workflows.",
  "sinks": "API calls to AWS services that could affect deployment states; no untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Functions invoke external API calls (`wait_for_processed_app_versions`, `compose_environments`, `wait_for_compose_events`) in sequence, with control flow based on success/failure conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward deployment orchestration script for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, involving waiting for app version processing, composing environments, and optionally waiting for deployment events. It relies on external modules for AWS API interactions and contains no malicious, obfuscated, or insecure practices. The logic is standard for deployment automation, with proper control flow and no evident vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest a benign purpose. External modules are assumed safe; no malicious behavior is detected within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate deployment orchestration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's function and security posture.",
