{
  "purpose": "The code provides CLI prompts for AWS spot instance configuration, asking users for instance types and whether to enable spot requests.",
  "sources": "User input via io.prompt() and io.get_boolean_response() functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; user responses are returned locally.",
  "flows": "User inputs are collected through prompts and returned; no external data flows or processing of untrusted data beyond input collection.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, relying on external 'io' module functions for user interaction. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or insecure data handling. The functions are simple and purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The only minor note is that 'get_spot_instance_types_from_customer' returns None when 'not interactive or not enable_spot', which may be intentional or could be clarified, but it does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for user prompts related to AWS spot instances. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing security and malware scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
