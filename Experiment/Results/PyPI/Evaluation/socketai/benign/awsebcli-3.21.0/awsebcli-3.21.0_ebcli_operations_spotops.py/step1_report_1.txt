{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to prompt users for configuration options related to spot instances in an AWS environment, specifically for selecting instance types and enabling spot requests.",
  "sources": "Input prompts via io.prompt() and io.get_boolean_response(), which read user responses from standard input.",
  "sinks": "None detected. User responses are processed internally without any untrusted data being sent externally or used in insecure operations.",
  "flows": "User input collected through io.prompt() and io.get_boolean_response() flows into internal variables and function return values, with no external data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides user prompts and input handling for AWS spot instance configuration. It checks operational modes, displays prompts, and returns user inputs without performing any external network operations, data manipulation, or insecure processing. All functions utilize the 'io' module for input/output, which appears to be standard for CLI interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks present in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward user interface for configuration prompts with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, external calls, or suspicious logic.",
