{
  "purpose": "The code provides user prompts for configuring AWS spot instances interactively, primarily for selecting instance types and enabling spot requests.",
  "sources": "User inputs via io.prompt() and io.get_boolean_response() functions, which gather user responses during execution.",
  "sinks": "The responses collected are returned by functions; potential for misuse depends on how the return values are used elsewhere. No direct data sinks or external data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "User input functions collect data, which is then returned to the caller. No direct data flow to external systems within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The code relies on external modules for I/O, which are not included here.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing prompts to the user and capturing responses for AWS spot instance configuration. No data is processed insecurely, and no external communications or system modifications are evident. The functions are simple, and the logic is clear. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard user-interaction module for AWS configuration, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It relies on external modules for input/output, and no sensitive data handling or security vulnerabilities are apparent within this fragment.",
