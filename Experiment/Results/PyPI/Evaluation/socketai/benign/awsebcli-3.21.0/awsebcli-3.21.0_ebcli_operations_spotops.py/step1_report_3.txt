{
  "purpose": "This code provides user prompts to select Amazon EC2 spot instance options, including instance types and enabling spot requests, in an interactive CLI tool.",
  "sources": "User input via io.prompt() and io.get_boolean_response() functions.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from prompt_for_instance_types() and get_boolean_response() functions; no external data sinks or network communications.",
  "flows": "User inputs from prompts are returned directly; no further processing or data flow to external systems observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard input/output procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily responsible for prompting the user for configuration choices related to EC2 spot instances. It imports functions from an external library (ebcli.core.io), which handles input/output. The functions facilitate interactive user prompts and do not process untrusted data beyond user input, nor do they include any network activity, file access, or hidden behaviors. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI interaction module for collecting user preferences about EC2 spot instances. There are no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities within this snippet.",
