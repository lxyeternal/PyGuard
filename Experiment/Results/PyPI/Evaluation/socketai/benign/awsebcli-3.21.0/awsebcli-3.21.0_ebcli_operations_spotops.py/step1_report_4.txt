  "purpose": "Provides interactive prompts for users to select EC2 instance types and spot request options in an AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Reads from prompts dictionary for display messages; reads user input via io.prompt and io.get_boolean_response methods.",
  "sinks": "None; user input is collected but not used in a malicious or insecure manner within this code.",
  "flows": "Displays prompts to the user and collects responses; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interaction module that prompts the user for input regarding spot instance types and enabling spot requests. It uses a straightforward approach with input validation via io methods. There are no external data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The functions simply collect user preferences and return them, with no indication of data being sent externally or stored insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign user interface component for AWS CLI. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its sole purpose is to interactively collect user input related to spot instances, with no evident security issues.",
