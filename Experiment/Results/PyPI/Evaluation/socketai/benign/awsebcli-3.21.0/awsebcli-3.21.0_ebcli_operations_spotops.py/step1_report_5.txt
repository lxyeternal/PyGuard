{
  "purpose": "The code provides user prompts to select AWS EC2 spot instance types and whether to enable spot requests, used in an interactive CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via io.prompt() and io.get_boolean_response() functions.",
  "sinks": "The user's choices are returned; no direct data sinks are present. No external data leaks or harmful actions are performed.",
  "flows": "User inputs from io.prompt() and io.get_boolean_response() are captured and returned for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code strictly handles user prompts and responses.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for input/output operations and strings. It provides functions to prompt the user for instance types and a boolean choice on spot requests. The code only interacts with user inputs, with no data processing beyond returning user selections. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex dynamic code execution. Overall, the code appears to be a standard CLI user interaction module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign user prompt interface for AWS Spot Instances configuration. It contains no malware, no malicious behavior, and no security risks. It simply collects user preferences and returns them.",
