      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured async web client with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The low security risk score is justified by minimal validation and broad exception handling but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production with minor considerations for URL validation if needed."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor design flaw related to shared state via a class attribute. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security threat present. The low security risk score is appropriate, though it could be slightly increased to reflect the shared state issue. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward."
