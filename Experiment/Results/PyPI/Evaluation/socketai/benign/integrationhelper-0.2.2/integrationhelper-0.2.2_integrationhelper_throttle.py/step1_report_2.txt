{
  "purpose": "The class Throttle is designed to control the timing of certain actions by checking if a specified interval has passed since the last execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time using datetime.now() in set_last_run() and throttle property.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "The source is datetime.now(), used to record or compare the last run time; the flow compares current time with last_run + interval to decide if throttling should occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple throttling mechanism based on time intervals. It uses class variables for interval and last_run. The method set_last_run updates the last_run timestamp, while the property throttle checks if enough time has passed since the last run. The logic is standard, with no suspicious operations or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a throttling mechanism without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It relies solely on system time and does not process untrusted input or perform any harmful actions.",
