{
  "purpose": "The class is designed to implement a throttling mechanism to limit the frequency of certain actions based on time intervals.",
  "sources": "Code reads system time using datetime.now() in set_last_run() and throttle property.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code only manages internal state based on system time.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting last_run with current system time and checking if enough time has elapsed since last_run to determine throttling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple throttling class with a fixed interval of 60 seconds. It uses datetime.now() to set and compare times to enforce the throttle. The methods are standard and do not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic throttling mechanism without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be safe and standard.",
