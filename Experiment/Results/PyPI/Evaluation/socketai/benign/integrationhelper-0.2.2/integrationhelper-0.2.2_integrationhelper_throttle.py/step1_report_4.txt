{
  "purpose": "A simple throttling mechanism to limit the frequency of an action, based on time intervals.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current system time using datetime.now() in set_last_run() and throttle property.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could leak information; the code only manages time state.",
  "flows": "set_last_run() updates last_run with current time; throttle property compares last_run + interval with current time to determine if throttling is needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation. No suspicious network or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a straightforward throttling pattern, storing the last run time and checking whether enough time has passed to allow another run. The use of datetime.now() for timing is standard. No external inputs or outputs are processed that could indicate malicious activity. No malware or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign throttling utility without malicious intent or security issues. It only manages timing state for controlling execution frequency.",
