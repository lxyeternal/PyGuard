{
  "purpose": "Provides simple registry classes for storing key-value pairs and lists with add/remove functionalities.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; internal data structures are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks; internal data modifications only.",
  "anomalies": "Class-level register attributes are shared among all instances, which could lead to unintended side-effects but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, RegistryDict and RegistryList, for managing registries of data. Both classes use class variables for storage, meaning the data is shared across all instances, which might be a design concern but not inherently malicious. No input/output, network operations, or environment variable usage are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be straightforward and simple, serving as utility data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements basic registry data structures with shared class attributes, which could lead to unintended side effects but shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious activities present.",
