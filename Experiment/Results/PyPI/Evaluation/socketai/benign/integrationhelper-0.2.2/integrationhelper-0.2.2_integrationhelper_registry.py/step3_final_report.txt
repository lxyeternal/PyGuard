  "purpose": "Implement simple in-memory registry data structures for key-value pairs and lists.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of class variables ('register') shared across all instances, which could lead to unintended side-effects but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, RegistryDict and RegistryList, with class-level storage. Methods add and remove modify this shared state. No external I/O, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The shared class variables could cause bugs if multiple instances are used, but this is a design concern, not a security issue. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, simple utility classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only concern is the shared class variables, which are a design choice, not a security risk. The overall security risk and malware scores should remain at 0.",
