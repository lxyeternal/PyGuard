  "purpose": "Provides simple registry classes for managing key-value pairs and lists.",
  "sources": "No external input reading, internal data structures only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; internal data modifications only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, RegistryDict and RegistryList, for managing registry data structures in-memory. Both classes use standard Python data structures (dict and list) with methods for adding and removing items. There are no external input/output operations, no use of environment variables, no network activity, and no embedded code execution. The code appears to be straightforward utility classes without malicious intent or suspicious patterns. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is simple and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides basic in-memory registry classes with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be harmless utility code.",
