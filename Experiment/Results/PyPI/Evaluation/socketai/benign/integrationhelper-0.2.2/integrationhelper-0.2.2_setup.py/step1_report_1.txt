{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the configuration for a Python package named 'integrationhelper'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for the long description, and the 'setuptools.setup()' function for package configuration details.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or potential data leaks are present. No data is being sent or processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "The content read from 'README.md' flows into the 'long_description' parameter; package metadata flows into the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads a README file for long description, and invokes 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All actions are typical for package setup scripts. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors. The code only performs configuration and file reading, which are common and benign activities in package distribution workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads a README file and configures package metadata for distribution.",
