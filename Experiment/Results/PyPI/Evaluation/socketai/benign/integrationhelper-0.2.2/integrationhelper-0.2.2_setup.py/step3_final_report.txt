{
  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata provided directly in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reads local README.md file -> passes data to setup() -> package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a local README.md file, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input occurs. The code structure is simple and conventional, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
