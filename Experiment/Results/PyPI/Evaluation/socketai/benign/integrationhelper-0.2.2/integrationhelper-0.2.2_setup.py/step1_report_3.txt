  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'integrationhelper' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata, dependencies list",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "N/A - the code primarily loads static configuration data and dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the README.md for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for package setup and do not include dynamic code execution, external data inputs, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration script with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
