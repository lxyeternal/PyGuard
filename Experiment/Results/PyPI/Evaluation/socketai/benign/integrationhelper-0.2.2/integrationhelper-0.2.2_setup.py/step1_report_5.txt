  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content, then pass data to setuptools.setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools, reading a README file for the long description, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident. No suspicious or unusual patterns, nor any obfuscated or hidden code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
