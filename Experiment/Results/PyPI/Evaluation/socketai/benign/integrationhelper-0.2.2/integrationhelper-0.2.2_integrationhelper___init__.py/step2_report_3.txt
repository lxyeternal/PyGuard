  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the 'integrationhelper' package.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or data sinks are present.\n- No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward import statements. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks based solely on these import statements.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there is no suspicious activity, no data flow, and no malicious code, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior is indicated.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No claims in the reports rely on assumptions; they are based on the code's content.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code only imports modules; no executable logic or data handling.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The package components are common and legitimate.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippet is a benign, standard initialization segment with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets include actual logic, data handling, or network operations, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
