{
  "purpose": "A simple wrapper around Python's standard logging library that sanitizes the logger name.",
  "sources": "The logger name provided during initialization, and message parameters passed to logging methods.",
  "sinks": "The underlying logging system, which outputs messages to configured handlers; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Input messages are received by methods (debug, info, warning, error, critical) and forwarded directly to the logging system without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, external network calls, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, transparent wrapper around Python's logging library. It sanitizes the logger name by replacing '/' with '.', which is benign. All methods delegate directly to the standard logging functions, with no data manipulation, external calls, or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not process untrusted data in a risky way, nor does it perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0-0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, well-structured logging utility with no security risks or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are appropriate and align with the code's simplicity and transparency.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
