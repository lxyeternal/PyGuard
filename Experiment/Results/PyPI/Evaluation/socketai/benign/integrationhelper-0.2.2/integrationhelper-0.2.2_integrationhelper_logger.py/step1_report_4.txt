  "purpose": "A custom logging wrapper class for standardized logging output.",
  "sources": "Input messages passed to the debug, info, warning, error, and critical methods.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls to Python's standard logging library, which outputs to configured handlers (e.g., console, files).",
  "flows": "Input messages flow from method calls in the Logger class to the underlying logging.getLogger().<logger_name> methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses a straightforward pattern for logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Logger class that wraps the standard Python logging module. It replaces '/' with '.' in the logger name, then forwards log messages to the appropriate logging level. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious activity are present. The structure is straightforward and standard for logging wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate logging within an application.",
