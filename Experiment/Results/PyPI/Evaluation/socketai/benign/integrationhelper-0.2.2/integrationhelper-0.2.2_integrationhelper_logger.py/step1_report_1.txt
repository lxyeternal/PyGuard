  "purpose": "Provide a custom logging class for application debug and information messages.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "outputs": "None; the code does not write output that could be untrusted or influence external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears straightforward and standard for a logging utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Logger class that wraps Python's standard logging library. It sanitizes the logger name by replacing '/' with '.', but otherwise, it only delegates logging messages at various levels. No input/output data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The class is a simple wrapper, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign wrapper around Python's logging library with no malicious or security-risk behaviors identified.",
