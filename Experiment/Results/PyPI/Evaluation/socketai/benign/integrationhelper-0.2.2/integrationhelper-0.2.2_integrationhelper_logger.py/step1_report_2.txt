{
  "purpose": "A custom logger class to facilitate logging messages at various severity levels.",
  "sources": "Input comes from method calls passing the 'message' parameter, which are then forwarded to the standard logging library.",
  "sinks": "The code writes messages to the configured logging handlers; no external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input message passed into each method flows directly to the corresponding logging call without any transformation or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a wrapper around Python's standard logging module, with methods for different log levels. It sanitizes the 'name' parameter by replacing '/' with '.', which is benign. The methods directly call the logging library with the provided messages. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious code, or external network interactions. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of logging, with no complex logic or external dependencies that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a dangerous manner nor does it perform any suspicious operations.",
