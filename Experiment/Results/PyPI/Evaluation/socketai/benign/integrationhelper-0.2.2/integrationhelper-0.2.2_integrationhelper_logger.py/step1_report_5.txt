{
  "purpose": "A simple custom logger class to wrap around Python's standard logging module for consistent logging messages.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'message' parameter passed to each logging method; the class itself does not read external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls to Python's standard logging system; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere, no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input message passed into logger methods flows directly into the logging functions; no additional data flow manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Logger class with methods for different log levels, each calling the standard logging module. The class replaces '/' with '.' in the logger name, likely for namespace formatting. There are no input validation issues, no external data fetching, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to typical Python logging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper around the Python logging library intended for structured logging. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
