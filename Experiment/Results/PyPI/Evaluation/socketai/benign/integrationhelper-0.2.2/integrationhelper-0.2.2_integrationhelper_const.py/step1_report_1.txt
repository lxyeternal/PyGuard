  "purpose": "Define constants and template strings for a custom integration, likely for displaying startup messages.",
  "sources": "Constant list GOOD_HTTP_CODES and string templates CC_STARTUP and CC_STARTUP_VERSION",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, output, or data flow to external systems",
  "flows": "No data flows or input/output operations detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of HTTP status codes considered 'good' and two multi-line string templates intended for startup messages. There are no functions, no data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information handling. The code appears to be purely static definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, containing only static constants and message templates for informational purposes. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
