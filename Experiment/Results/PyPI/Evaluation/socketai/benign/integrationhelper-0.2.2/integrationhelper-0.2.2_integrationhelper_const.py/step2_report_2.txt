  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static constants and string templates.\n- No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be purely configuration or presentation templates for a custom integration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The `GOOD_HTTP_CODES` list is a straightforward list of HTTP status codes considered \"good,\" with no suspicious entries.\n- The string templates (`CC_STARTUP`, `CC_STARTUP_VERSION`) are static multi-line strings with placeholders for dynamic insertion, typical for logging or user messages.\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external data handling.\n- No code execution, network activity, or data flow that could be malicious.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity or behavior.\n- **Security risk (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or security issues identified.\n- **Confidence (1):** Justified, the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues or claims to challenge:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and static.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the observable code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, static, and intended for configuration or display purposes.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected. The reported scores are accurate and justified.",
