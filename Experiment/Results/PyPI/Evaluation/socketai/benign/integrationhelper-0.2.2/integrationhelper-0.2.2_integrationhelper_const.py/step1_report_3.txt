{
  "purpose": "Define constants and template strings for a custom integration, likely used for displaying startup messages and HTTP status code validation.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or untrusted data sources. It only defines constants and string templates.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely defines static constants and templates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of constant definitions for HTTP status codes and multi-line string templates for startup messages. All elements are static data with no dynamic execution, data input, or external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks. The structure is straightforward and standard for configuration or presentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as static configuration for messages and constants in a larger application. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected.",
