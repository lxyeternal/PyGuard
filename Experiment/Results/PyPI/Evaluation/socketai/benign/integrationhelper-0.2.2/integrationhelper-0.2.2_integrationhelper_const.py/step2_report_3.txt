  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static constants and string templates.\n   - No functions, data input/output, dynamic code execution, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code appears to be purely configuration or presentation setup, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity or Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n   - The code is straightforward, with clear placeholders and no embedded or hidden code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their assessment.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is static and only defines constants and templates, there is no immediate security concern.\n   - The placeholders in the templates suggest they are used for user-facing messages or logs, which is typical and safe.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n- The code is benign, static, and free of obfuscation or malware.\n- The assigned scores (obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The code does not warrant any security concern or higher risk scoring.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores assigned are justified.",
