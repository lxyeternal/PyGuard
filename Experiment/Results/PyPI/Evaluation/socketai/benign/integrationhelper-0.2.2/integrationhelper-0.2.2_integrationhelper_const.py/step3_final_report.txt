{
  "purpose": "Defines static constants and string templates for a custom integration, likely used for display or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined constants and string templates; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only contains static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants and string templates with placeholders. No functions, input handling, dynamic code, or external interactions are present. The code is typical for configuration or presentation purposes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its static and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for configuration or display. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scoring accurately reflects its safe status.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
