  "purpose": "Define constants and template strings for a custom integration, likely used for display or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; constants and string templates are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no processing or output of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists of static data definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining constants and string templates with placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of HTTP status codes and two string templates with placeholders for dynamic content. There are no functions, no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded or obfuscated code. The templates are for informational or logging purposes, with no apparent security risk. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, static configuration and template setup for a custom integration, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
