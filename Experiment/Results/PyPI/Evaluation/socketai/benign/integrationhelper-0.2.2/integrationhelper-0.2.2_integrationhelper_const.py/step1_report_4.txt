{
  "purpose": "Define constants and template strings for a custom integration, likely used for logging or user communication.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains constant definitions and string templates.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, inputs, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code uses straightforward constants and formatted strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of HTTP status codes and two multi-line string templates with placeholders for integration name, version, and issue link. There are no dynamic or executable parts, no user input processing, no external data handling, and no functions or code execution mechanisms. The absence of code execution, data processing, or network operations suggests no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is simple, static, and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as a configuration or template setup for an integration. No security concerns are identified.",
