  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as static definitions: constants and string templates.\n- No functions, input handling, dynamic code, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears purely for configuration or presentation purposes.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the static and benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward, with no evidence of malicious activity, data processing, or security risks.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or points to challenge:**\n- The reports are very consistent and conservative; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- Since the code is static configuration with no dynamic or external components, raising the malware or security risk scores above 0 would be unjustified.\n- The detailed reasoning about the absence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or vulnerabilities is sound.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The scores given (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The detailed analysis aligns with the code's static, benign nature.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring and reasoning are appropriate and consistent.",
