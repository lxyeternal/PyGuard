  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static constants and string templates.\n- No functions, input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.\n- The code appears to be purely configuration or presentation setup.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code defines a list of \"good\" HTTP status codes, which is standard.\n- The string templates include placeholders for dynamic content but contain no executable code.\n- There are no data sinks, no data flows, and no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign and static.\n- The confidence scores are set to 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, which is consistent.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are apparent in the reasoning or scoring.\n- The code's simplicity and lack of dynamic behavior justify the low risk and malware scores.\n- The detailed analysis supports the conclusion that this code is benign.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, static code)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign static configuration with no security concerns.",
