  "purpose": "Define a Version class for managing software version information with major, minor, and patch attributes.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters in __init__ method, property methods, and class attributes.",
  "sink": "Return statement in version property, which constructs and outputs a version string.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (__init__) → class attributes (major, minor, patch) → version property → return string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data access observed.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward implementation of version handling, with optional attributes and a method to return the version as a string. No external data sources, no network access, and no manipulation of untrusted input or sensitive data. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility class for version management with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain malicious code.",
