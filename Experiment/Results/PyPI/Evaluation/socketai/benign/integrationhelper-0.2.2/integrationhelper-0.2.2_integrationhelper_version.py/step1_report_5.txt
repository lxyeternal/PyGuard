  "purpose": "Defines a Version class for managing software version information with properties and string representation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; no input/output operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points; no external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class only manipulates internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple class for version management, including attribute initialization and a property method to output the version string. There are no input/output operations, no network activity, no data processing of external inputs, and no embedded or obfuscated code. The logic is standard and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely handles internal data without external interactions.",
