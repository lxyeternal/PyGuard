  "purpose": "Define a Version class to manage software version information with major, minor, and patch attributes.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is set via constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data; only returning a formatted version string.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to class attributes, then to the version property which constructs a string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for managing version information with attributes for major, minor, and patch versions. The constructor allows optional initialization, and the version property constructs a dot-separated string of available version parts. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code appears standard, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version management class with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply encapsulates version data and formats it as a string.",
