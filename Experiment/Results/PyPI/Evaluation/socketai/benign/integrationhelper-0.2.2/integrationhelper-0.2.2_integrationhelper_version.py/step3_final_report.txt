  "purpose": "A simple utility class to manage software version information with optional major, minor, and patch attributes, providing a string representation of the version.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (major, minor, patch) used to set attributes; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Attributes are set during initialization; the 'version' property constructs a string from these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Minor note: no input validation for attribute types, but this does not impact security.",
  "analysis": "The class is a benign, straightforward implementation for version management. It does not read external data, perform network operations, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscation. The 'version' property concatenates optional integer attributes into a string, which is safe. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious constructs or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The only minor improvement could be explicit type validation, but it is not necessary for security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility class with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
