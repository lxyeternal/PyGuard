  "purpose": "Define a Version class for managing software version information.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__ method (major, minor, patch); property method 'version' accessing instance attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit untrusted data outside of internal logic.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version components (major, minor, patch) -> retrieval of version string via 'version' property.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a simple data structure to store version numbers and retrieve them as a string. No external input sources or sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present. The version property concatenates stored attributes without modification or external influence, indicating safe, straightforward behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Version class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
