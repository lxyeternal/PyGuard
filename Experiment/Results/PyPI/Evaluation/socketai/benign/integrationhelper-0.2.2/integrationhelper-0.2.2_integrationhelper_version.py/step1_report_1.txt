  "purpose": "To define a Version class that manages version information with attributes and a property to return the version as a string.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple class with attributes for major, minor, and patch version numbers. The version property constructs a string representation based on these attributes. No input, output, or external data handling is performed, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version utility class with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
