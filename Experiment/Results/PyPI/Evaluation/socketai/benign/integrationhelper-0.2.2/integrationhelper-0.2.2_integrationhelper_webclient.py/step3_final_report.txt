  "purpose": "A standard asynchronous web client for fetching JSON or text data from URLs with retries and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL (string) and optional headers (dict); performs HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "Response data (JSON or text) is logged; no data exfiltration or malicious sink identified.",
  "flows": "Input URL and headers → HTTP request → response → parse and log data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; use of broad exception handling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async HTTP client using aiohttp, with input validation, retries via backoff, and extensive logging. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Error handling is broad but standard. The response data is logged, which could leak sensitive info in some contexts but is typical for debugging. No suspicious network activity or code injection detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign analysis. The high confidence (0.9) reflects the clear, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured async web client with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The low security risk score is justified by minimal validation and broad exception handling but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production with minor considerations for URL validation if needed.",
