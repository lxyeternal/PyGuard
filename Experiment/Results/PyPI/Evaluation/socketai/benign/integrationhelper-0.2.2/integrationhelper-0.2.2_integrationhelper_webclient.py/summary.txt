  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured async web client with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The low security risk score is justified by minimal validation and broad exception handling but does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production with minor considerations for URL validation if needed."
