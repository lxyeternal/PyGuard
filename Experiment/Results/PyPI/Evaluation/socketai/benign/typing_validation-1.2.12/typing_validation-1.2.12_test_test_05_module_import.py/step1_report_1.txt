{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test setup for mocking module import failures related to 'typing_extensions' in Python, likely for testing compatibility or import error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads data from sys.meta_path and sys.modules to manipulate import behavior; accesses 'typing_extensions' to delete from modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code modifies sys.meta_path to inject a custom module finder and deletes 'typing_extensions' from sys.modules before importing 'typing_validation', creating a controlled import environment.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a custom module finder to simulate import failure for 'typing_extensions'. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The test intentionally manipulates import system for testing purposes, which is a common testing pattern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a mock module finder that raises ModuleNotFoundError for specified modules, used in a pytest test function. It conditionally modifies the import system to simulate missing modules, then attempts to import 'typing_validation'. This is a controlled test setup without any malicious behavior. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code's purpose is likely for compatibility testing or error handling validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup for import error simulation related to 'typing_extensions'. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The code is intended for testing and does not pose a threat.",
