  "anomalies": [
    "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors.",
    "Code is standard configuration code with no obfuscated logic or malicious functions.",
    "No network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
    "Reading a local JSON file ('autodoc-type-aliases.json') is typical for configuration and not suspicious."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file. It imports necessary modules, sets project info, extensions, and paths, and loads a JSON file for type aliases. It also defines a function for handling missing references and registers it with the Sphinx application. All operations are standard and localized to configuration; there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs expected setup functions for documentation generation without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
