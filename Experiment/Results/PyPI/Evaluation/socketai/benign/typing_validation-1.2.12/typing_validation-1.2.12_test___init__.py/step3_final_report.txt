{
  "purpose": "Assessment of open source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, environment variables, network calls, dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), file reads/writes, URL/IP addresses.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, subprocess execution, environment variables, clipboard or sensitive data access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or network data flow into eval/exec or network calls, potentially leading to data exfiltration, code execution, or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns include obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious URLs/IPs, network activity, hardcoded secrets, lack of comments, or unusual variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code with suspicious constructs like eval/exec, obfuscation, and network activity indicates high malicious potential. Absence of code or benign patterns suggest low risk. The detailed suspicion in report 2 justifies high malware (0.85), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.9). Other reports lack evidence of malicious activity, with scores appropriately set at zero or low. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and patterns, with no overestimations detected.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 demonstrates strong indicators of malicious behavior and obfuscation, warranting high scores. Other reports lack evidence of malicious activity, reflected in low scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence and reasoning provided.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "malware": 0.85,
