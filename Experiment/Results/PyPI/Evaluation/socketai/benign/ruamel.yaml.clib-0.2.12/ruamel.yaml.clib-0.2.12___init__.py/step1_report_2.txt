  "purpose": "Defines metadata and build configuration for a Python package containing a C extension for ruamel.yaml.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields, source code references, and inline C code snippets within the 'ext_modules' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code primarily declares static data and build instructions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata and source code included in the package build process.",
  "anomalies": "Contains inline C code for a minimal 'main' function and a test string with C code; these are benign and related to package compilation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily metadata for a Python package, describing a C extension module. It includes source file names, a simple C main function, and versioning info. No runtime input, network activity, or data handling occurs. The inline C code is minimal and appears intended for testing or compilation purposes. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code serves as package metadata and build instructions with embedded minimal C code for extension compilation. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code is safe and standard for C extension package setup.",
