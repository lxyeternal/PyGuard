  "purpose": "Static package metadata and build configuration for a Python C extension module, including minimal test C code snippets.",
  "sources": "Static strings, source file lists, inline C code snippets, author and version information.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, no runtime data processing, no network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists solely of static configuration data and minimal placeholder C code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration for building a Python C extension, with embedded minimal C code snippets used for testing or compilation. There are no signs of dynamic data handling, external communication, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The test C code is a simple main function returning 0, typical for build tests. The author and version metadata are static strings. No suspicious patterns or behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package setup code with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0, reflecting the static and safe nature of the code.",
