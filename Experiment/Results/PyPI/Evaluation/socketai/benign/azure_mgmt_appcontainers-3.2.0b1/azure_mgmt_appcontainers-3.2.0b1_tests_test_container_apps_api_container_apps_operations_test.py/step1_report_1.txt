  "purpose": "Unit testing of Azure Container Apps management client using pytest framework",
  "sources": "Import statements, test class setup, and test methods",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; standard API calls and assertions",
  "flows": "Test methods invoke Azure SDK client methods without handling untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior; code appears standard for testing",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up test class with pytest, and defines two test methods that invoke Azure SDK functions. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious network activity are present. All operations seem related to standard unit testing and resource management. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test for Azure SDK client functionality, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
