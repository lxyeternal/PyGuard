  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package compatibility and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to extend the package's __path__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import and modification of __path__, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically and extends the module's __path__ variable, which is typically used to support namespace packages or facilitate package distribution. This pattern is standard in some advanced packaging scenarios. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code is minimal and functional, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard approach to handling namespace packages in Python and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
