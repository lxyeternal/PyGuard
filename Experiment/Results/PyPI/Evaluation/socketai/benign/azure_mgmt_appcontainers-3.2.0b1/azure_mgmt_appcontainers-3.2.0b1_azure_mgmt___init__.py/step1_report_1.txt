  "purpose": "Extend the current package's search path for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "__path__, __name__",
  "sinks": "None observed; no direct data leaks or untrusted data usage.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__, which is standard practice for namespace packages, but it is minimal and could be used maliciously if combined with other code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to modify the '__path__' variable, likely for namespace package support. This pattern is common and legitimate in Python packaging. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious network calls, or obfuscated components. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit suspicious behaviors on its own. However, its use could be part of a malicious package if combined with other malicious code elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages and does not contain any malicious behavior by itself. Its presence alone does not suggest malware or security risks, though in a larger context, it could be part of a package with malicious intent. No security concerns are identified in this isolated snippet.",
