  "purpose": "Extend package's search path for namespace package support, enabling modular distribution.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' and invocation of 'extend_path' on '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' -> assign result to '__path__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of a standard namespace package pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a common, well-documented pattern in Python for supporting namespace packages. It involves importing 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__' with 'extend_path', which is a legitimate and safe operation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this pattern. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain hidden backdoors. The slight variation in risk scores (around 0.2) reflects the minimal potential for misuse if combined with malicious code elsewhere, but the snippet itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern used in Python packaging for namespace support. All reports correctly identify it as non-malicious, with appropriate scoring. No security concerns are associated with this snippet in isolation.",
