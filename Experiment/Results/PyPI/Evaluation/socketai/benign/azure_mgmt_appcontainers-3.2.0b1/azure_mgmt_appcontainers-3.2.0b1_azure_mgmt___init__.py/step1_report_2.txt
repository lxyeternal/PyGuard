  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package submodules using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' and accessing '__path__' and '__name__' variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code modifies '__path__' based on 'pkgutil.extend_path', but does not involve any untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard package initialization pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends the '__path__' variable for the current package/module. '__path__' is a special attribute used for namespace packages to include additional directories for module lookup. This pattern is common in namespace package implementations and does not involve any user input, network data, or other untrusted sources. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign pattern for namespace package extension. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
