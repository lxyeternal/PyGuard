  "purpose": "This code provides a placeholder function for extending or patching generated SDK code, specifically for handwritten extensions to an SDK.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are read in this code; it contains only a function definition with no implementation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations are present; the code does not process data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist in this code as it contains only a stub function with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is mostly comments and an empty function.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing and copyright notices, followed by a single function definition 'patch_sdk' that is currently empty. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic to analyze. The purpose is to serve as a placeholder for SDK extension code, not to execute any operations or include any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code. It is a benign template or placeholder intended for future extension.",
