  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code is a standard license header followed by a single function `patch_sdk()` that is empty.\n   - No data inputs, outputs, or processing.\n   - No external calls, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n   - The purpose is explicitly to serve as a placeholder for SDK extensions or patches.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks**:\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - No data flows, no sinks, no sources.\n   - No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.\n   - The function is a stub, intentionally left empty for future extension.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The code contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n4. **Security Risk Score**:\n   - Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior, the security risk score should be 0.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Consistency**:\n   - The reports' scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores reflect the benign nature of this placeholder code.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\nThis code is a benign, standard template for SDK extension points, with no security issues or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
