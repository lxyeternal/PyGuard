  "purpose": "This code serves as a placeholder for handwritten extensions or patches to SDK-generated code, allowing customization without altering core SDK files.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the function is empty and contains no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely boilerplate with a standard license and a no-op function; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, secrets, or dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-documented stub intended for extension. It includes licensing information, comments, and a single empty function definition. There are no data inputs, outputs, or code that could be exploited. It does not contain any obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard placeholder file used for SDK patching or customization. No malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
