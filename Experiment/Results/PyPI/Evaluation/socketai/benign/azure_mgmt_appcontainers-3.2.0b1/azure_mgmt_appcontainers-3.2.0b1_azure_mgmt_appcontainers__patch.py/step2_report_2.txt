  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward placeholder function with only licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - No data inputs, outputs, or logic are present.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.\n   - All reports correctly identify this as benign, serving as an extension point.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They uniformly conclude no security issues, malware, or malicious intent.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which seems reasonable given the clear and straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The overall security risk is zero across all reports.\n   - Since the code is a benign placeholder with no data handling, no risk warrants a score above 0.5.\n   - The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations, data processing, or external calls.\n   - No malicious patterns or behaviors are present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a standard placeholder.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- The code is a benign placeholder with no security concerns.\n- The scores should remain as they are: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, non-malicious template for SDK extension. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The current scoring is appropriate and justified.",
