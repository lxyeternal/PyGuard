{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a placeholder for handwritten extensions to generated SDK code, allowing customization without modifying original source files.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the function does not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears as a standard, well-documented placeholder with licensing information, with no unusual or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single empty function definition intended for SDK patching. There are no data inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no security-sensitive operations. The absence of code logic, data handling, or dynamic execution indicates no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, non-malicious placeholder code with no security issues. It is a standard pattern for SDK customization. No malware or security risks are present.",
