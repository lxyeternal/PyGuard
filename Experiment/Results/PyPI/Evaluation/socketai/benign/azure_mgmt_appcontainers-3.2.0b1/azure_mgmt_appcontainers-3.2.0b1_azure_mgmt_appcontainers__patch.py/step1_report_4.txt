  "purpose": "The code provides a placeholder function for patching or extending an SDK, specifically for custom handwritten extensions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, consisting only of a license header and an empty function definition; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a standard license header and a single empty function intended for SDK patching. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external interactions. The function 'patch_sdk' is a placeholder with no implementation, thus no potential malicious activity or security issues are present. The overall structure and content are typical of documentation or extension points, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a template or extension point without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
