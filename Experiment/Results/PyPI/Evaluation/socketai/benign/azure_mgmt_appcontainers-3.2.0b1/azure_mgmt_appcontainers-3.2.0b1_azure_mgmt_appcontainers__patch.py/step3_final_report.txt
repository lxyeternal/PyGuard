  "purpose": "Placeholder function for handwritten extensions to SDK code, intended for future customization.",
  "sources": "No data inputs or external data sources; the function is empty.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function is a stub with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with licensing comments and an empty function.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and an empty function 'patch_sdk()'. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code serves as a benign placeholder for future SDK extensions. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious placeholder with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current assessment scores are appropriate and justified.",
