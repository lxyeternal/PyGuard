  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single function `patch_sdk()` that is empty.\n   - No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic are present.\n   - The function is a placeholder meant for future extension, with no operational code.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No external data handling, no data flows, no sink points.\n   - The code does not process or handle any data, nor does it perform any operations.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks**:\n   - The code is a benign template or extension point.\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no security issues, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The consistent zero scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk align with the code's content.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, no security risk present.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - The reports are based on a correct understanding that the code is a benign placeholder.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behavior are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, well-documented placeholder for SDK extension, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Final Estimation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
