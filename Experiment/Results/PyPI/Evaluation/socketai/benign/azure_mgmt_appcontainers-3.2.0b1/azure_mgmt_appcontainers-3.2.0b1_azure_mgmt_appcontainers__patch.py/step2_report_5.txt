  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic**:  \n   The code is a straightforward, well-documented placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with no implementation. It contains only licensing comments and no data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Patterns or Anomalies**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is a standard pattern for SDK customization points.\n\n3. **Data Inputs, Sinks, and Flows**:  \n   There are no data inputs, outputs, or flows. The code does not read, write, or process any data.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is justified as there are no security issues.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely a placeholder with no logic, no data handling, and no external interactions, there's no basis for increasing the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores.\n\n6. **Claims about Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The reports do not make any unfounded assumptions; they correctly identify this as a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: this code is a benign, standard placeholder with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is a simple, well-documented placeholder function with no malicious or security-related issues.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nNo changes needed; the analysis and scoring are accurate.",
