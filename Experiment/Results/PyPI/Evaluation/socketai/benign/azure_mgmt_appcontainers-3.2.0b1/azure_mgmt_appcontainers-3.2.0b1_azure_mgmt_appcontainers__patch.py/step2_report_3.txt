  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims against the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single function `patch_sdk()` that is empty.\n- No data inputs, outputs, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a benign placeholder/template for SDK extensions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple placeholder with no operational logic.\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk):** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scoring and reasoning:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is accurate. The code is purely structural with no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n   \n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious encoding.\n   \n3. **Security Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`. Given the code's nature, this is justified.\n\n4. **Purpose and analysis:**\n   - The purpose as a placeholder for SDK extension is well-understood and common practice.\n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, no input/output, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.**\n- **No changes are necessary.**\n- **The reports are accurate in their conclusion that this code poses no security risk.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign placeholder with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scoring aligns perfectly with the code's nature.",
