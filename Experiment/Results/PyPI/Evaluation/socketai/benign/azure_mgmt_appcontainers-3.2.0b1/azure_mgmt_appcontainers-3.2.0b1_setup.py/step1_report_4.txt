  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package distribution for the 'azure-mgmt-appcontainers' library, including reading version info, reading README and changelog files, and configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from version.py or _version.py; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files; reads package metadata and dependencies from hardcoded strings and files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input data is used in security-sensitive operations; no data is written to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "N/A – no untrusted data flows to insecure sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The version extraction uses regex but in a standard manner; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info, documentation files, and configuring package metadata. It uses regex to extract version numbers from local files, which is a common pattern. All inputs are from trusted local files, and no untrusted sources or insecure operations are detected. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The structure and flow are typical of setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
