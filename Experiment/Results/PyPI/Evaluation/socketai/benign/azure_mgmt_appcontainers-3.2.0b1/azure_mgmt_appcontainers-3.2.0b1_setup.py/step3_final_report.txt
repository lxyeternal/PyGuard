  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'azure-mgmt-appcontainers', configuring metadata, dependencies, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from local files ('version.py' or '_version.py'), reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files.",
  "sinks": "No external output or data transmission; only local file reads and setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Local files are read and their contents passed directly into setup(), with regex extracting version string.",
  "anomalies": "Regex pattern could raise an exception if version pattern is missing, but this is a common practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling. It uses standard practices for version extraction and package configuration. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The regex-based version extraction, while potentially brittle if files are malformed, is standard and not malicious. The script performs only static file reads and package setup operations, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All indicators point to a safe and typical implementation.",
