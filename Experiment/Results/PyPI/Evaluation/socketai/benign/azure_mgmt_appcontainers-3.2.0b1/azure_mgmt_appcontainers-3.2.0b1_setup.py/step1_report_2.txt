{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, specifically for building and distributing the azure-mgmt-appcontainers SDK.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from version.py or _version.py, reading README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data, or interacts with external inputs directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code reads version info from files and then passes static parameters to setup(). No dynamic or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "The version extraction uses regex to parse files for a VERSION string, which is a common pattern. No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs file existence checks, reads files for version and documentation, and calls setup() with static and derived parameters. The process appears standard for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is to package and distribute SDKs, with no external or untrusted data handling beyond standard file reading.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles version extraction and package configuration securely and predictably.",
