  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- The code reads version info from local files, reads documentation files, and configures package metadata.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- Regex is used to extract version strings, which is common practice, though it could potentially raise exceptions if the pattern isn't found.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose and logic are consistent across reports, indicating a benign, typical setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Version extraction**: The regex `re.search(r'^VERSION\\s*=\\s*[\\'\"]([^\\'\"]*)[\\'\"]', fd.read(), re.MULTILINE).group(1)` could raise an exception if the pattern isn't found. This is a minor robustness concern but not a security issue.\n- **No malicious code or external dependencies** are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No significant flaws or mistakes are evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All assign 0, which is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: All assign 0 or 0.5; given the benign nature, 0 is appropriate. The only minor concern is the regex, but it's standard and not risky.\n\n### Justifications:\n- **Risk higher than 0.5?** No. The code performs only static file reading and package configuration.\n- **Malware score?** 0 is justified; no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Obfuscated?** 0 is justified; code is clear and standard.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?** No. The regex could fail, but that’s a robustness issue, not a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code is standard, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor point is the regex pattern which could be made more robust, but that does not impact security.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
