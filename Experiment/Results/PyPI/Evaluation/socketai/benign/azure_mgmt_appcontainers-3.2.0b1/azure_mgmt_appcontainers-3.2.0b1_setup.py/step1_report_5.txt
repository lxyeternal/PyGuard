{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library related to Azure management.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a file (version.py or _version.py), reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and static package and dependency data within the script.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup()' function from setuptools to process package metadata, dependencies, and package data. No untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from files, then passes this and other static data into 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity are present. The version extraction uses regex but only on trusted local files.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package metadata, extracting version info from local files and configuring package setup parameters. It does not perform any runtime data handling or network operations. The version extraction uses regex on local files, which is standard practice. No malicious or suspicious code behaviors are observed. All dependencies are specified explicitly, and there is no indication of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks with no external or untrusted data influencing sensitive operations.",
