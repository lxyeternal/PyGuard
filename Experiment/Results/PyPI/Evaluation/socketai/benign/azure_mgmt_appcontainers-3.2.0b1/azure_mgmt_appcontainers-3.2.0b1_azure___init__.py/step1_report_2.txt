  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ attribute for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __import__ to access it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> Call 'extend_path' -> Assign to __path__",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import via __import__ with a string, which is a common pattern but can sometimes be used maliciously if the string is manipulated. However, here it is a static string indicating standard library usage. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, typically to support namespace packages. The use of __import__ with a string is standard in some dynamic import scenarios. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward, primarily serving a package structure purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard operation for namespace packages with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not access external data, execute malicious code, or include suspicious patterns.",
