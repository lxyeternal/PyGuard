{
  "purpose": "Extend the current package's search path for module discovery",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library module and modifies __path__ for package extension",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to modify __path__, which is a common technique for namespace packages. It does not include any network activity, data handling, or code execution that could be malicious. The purpose appears to be standard package management practice. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical namespace package extension without any signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign pattern used in Python packaging.",
