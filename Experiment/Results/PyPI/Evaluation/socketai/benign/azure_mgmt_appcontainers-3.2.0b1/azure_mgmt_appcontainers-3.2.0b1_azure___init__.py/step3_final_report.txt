  "purpose": "Support namespace packages by extending the module's search path using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkgutil' module and usage of __import__('pkgutil') to call extend_path.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __path__, no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path -> assign result to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a common pattern in Python namespace packages, importing 'pkgutil' dynamically and extending __path__ to support multiple directories. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard practice. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The import is static, and the code structure is simple and transparent. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace package support with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action needed.",
