  "purpose": "Sanitizes environment variables, HTTP headers, and JSON keys to prevent sensitive data leakage during testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), HTTP headers ('Set-Cookie', 'Cookie'), JSON path '$..access_token'.",
  "sinks": "Logging, test recordings, or any output where sanitized data is stored or displayed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and sanitized; headers and JSON keys are sanitized before being logged or recorded.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder values indicating test data; minor typo in comment ('aovid' instead of 'avoid'); no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables with default placeholders, then applies regex sanitizers to mask sensitive information in logs, headers, and JSON data. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The sanitization practices are standard for testing environments. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is a typo in a comment, which does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard sanitization setup for testing environments, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are justified. The risk is minimal, and the code poses no security threat.",
