{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization and data masking for testing, specifically sanitizing sensitive information such as subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs, client secrets, cookies, and access tokens during test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), data in test recordings (cookies, access tokens)",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers modify or mask sensitive data in logs, recordings, and headers to prevent leakage",
  "flows": "Sensitive environment variables are read and sanitized; data such as access tokens and cookies are sanitized in test outputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of default placeholder values for secrets and IDs (all set to '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') indicates placeholder or test data; no malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The script imports environment variables and sanitizes them in test recordings, replacing real secrets with placeholders. The use of environment variables and sanitizers aligns with security best practices to prevent sensitive data exposure. No external data is being sent, no obfuscated or suspicious code is present. The code’s purpose is to facilitate secure testing and data masking, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup for masking sensitive data during recordings. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It appears to be correctly implemented for its purpose.",
