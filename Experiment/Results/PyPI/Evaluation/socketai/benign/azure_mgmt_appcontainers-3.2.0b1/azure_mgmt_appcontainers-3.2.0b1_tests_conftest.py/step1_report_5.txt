{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization for testing purposes, specifically to anonymize sensitive information in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that replace sensitive data in logs or recordings",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, and sanitizers modify or mask their values in output logs or recordings",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard sanitization procedures for testing environment",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, loads environment variables, and sets up sanitization functions to mask sensitive data such as subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs, and secrets during testing. These actions are common in testing frameworks to prevent exposure of secrets. There are no code injections, data leaks, or malicious commands present. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code is observed. The code appears to be standard test setup for handling sensitive information securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for masking sensitive environment variables and HTTP headers during recordings. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It is designed to protect secrets in test environments.",
