{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up environment sanitizers and fixtures for testing, specifically sanitizing sensitive information in test recordings to prevent leakage of credentials and session data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), which are read to sanitize data in tests.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers applied to logs, network traffic, or test recordings to remove sensitive data; no direct data leaks or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, and sanitizers are applied to these inputs to prevent sensitive data from appearing in test outputs or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code primarily sanitizes known sensitive data and headers, which is standard in testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to environment variable management and testing utilities. It loads environment variables for Azure credentials, which are used to set regex sanitizers. These sanitizers replace sensitive data such as subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret with placeholders. Additional sanitizers are applied to HTTP headers and JSON keys related to session tokens. All actions are consistent with security best practices for test data management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing fixture setup that sanitizes sensitive environment data and HTTP headers to prevent leaks during testing. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
