{
  "purpose": "This code sets up environment variable sanitization for testing purposes, specifically to mask sensitive information such as credentials and tokens in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), which are read via os.environ.get()",
  "sinks": "Sanitizer functions that mask or replace sensitive data in logs or recordings, including regex-based sanitizers for headers and JSON response bodies",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, then passed to sanitizers which replace sensitive data in logs or responses as sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code only sanitizes sensitive information for testing logs. No hardcoded credentials beyond placeholders, no network activity, or system modification code",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, which are then sanitized using regex to prevent sensitive data leakage in test recordings. The environment variables are defaulted to placeholder values. Sanitizers are applied to headers and JSON body data. There are no indications of malicious intent or unusual code execution, and no malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely focused on sanitizing sensitive information during testing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard testing setup for masking secrets in logs.",
