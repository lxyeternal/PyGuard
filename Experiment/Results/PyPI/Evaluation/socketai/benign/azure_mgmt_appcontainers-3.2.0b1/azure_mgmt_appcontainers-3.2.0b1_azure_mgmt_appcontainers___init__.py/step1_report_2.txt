{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated SDK module for interacting with Azure Container Apps, setting up imports and configurations for API client usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_container_apps_api_client, _version, _patch), and the VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs; mainly imports and initializations.",
  "flows": "Imports and module setup do not process external input data or execute untrusted code flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from _patch (`from ._patch import *`) could introduce unexpected symbols into the namespace, which may lead to unpredictable behavior but is common in generated code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports, sets up versioning, and calls an initialization function (_patch_sdk). The wildcard import is a potential concern but is typical in auto-generated SDK code. No external inputs, user data handling, or network communications are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious code. It appears to be standard SDK boilerplate, with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical auto-generated SDK module for Azure container management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The wildcard import is a minor concern but common in such contexts.",
