  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes typical SDK setup; no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No risky data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) noted, which can be risky but is common in SDKs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate; no malicious behavior detected. The wildcard import warrants cautious review but is acceptable here.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the auto-generated nature and typical setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent with the reasoning.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on dynamic import and potential concerns about namespace pollution.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights the use of wildcard import and dynamic imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Notes the standard SDK setup, with dynamic import and patch application.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — acceptable, perhaps slightly lower due to the routine nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is typical SDK initialization code, auto-generated, with no external data handling or network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are all low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the routine nature of the code. The only minor concern is the use of wildcard imports and dynamic imports, which are common in SDKs but could be exploited if the modules are compromised. However, given the context, these are standard patterns and not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are correctly set to 0.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The overall scores are reasonable.\n- Given the routine, auto-generated nature of the code, I would **not** elevate the risk or malware scores.\n- The wildcard import, while a potential concern in some contexts, is standard in SDK code and does not indicate malicious intent here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (appropriate)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.** The code is standard SDK setup with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk is due to the use of wildcard imports, but this is typical in auto-generated SDK code and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to 0.2, as per the reports)",
