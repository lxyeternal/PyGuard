  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a straightforward SDK initialization script.\n- Imports internal modules (. _container_apps_api_client, . _version, . _patch).\n- Sets version info.\n- Conditionally imports a list of patch symbols from _patch, with a fallback.\n- Uses a wildcard import from _patch.\n- Calls _patch_sdk() at the end.\n- No external input, network activity, or sensitive data handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as SDK setup, no external data sources.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Notes the wildcard import as potentially risky but common in SDKs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Finds no malicious intent, assigns malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound. Wildcard import can be risky but is typical here.  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- The security risk is low but acknowledges potential issues with wildcard import.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- The overall risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the auto-generated nature and the wildcard import.  \n- No external data handling, no suspicious code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly identifies the code as boilerplate SDK setup.  \n- Malware score=0 is justified.  \n- Slightly cautious due to wildcard import but overall safe.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- No change needed; the assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Focuses on dynamic import and wildcard import, common in SDK code.  \n- No external input or network activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Recognizes the pattern as typical in generated SDKs, not malicious.  \n- Malware=0 justified.  \n- Security risk=0.2 is acceptable.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Similar to previous, notes the import and patching mechanisms.  \n- No external data processing.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly states the code is standard SDK setup.  \n- Malware=0 justified.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Highlights the call to `_patch_sdk()` and the potential for executing code from imported modules.  \n- Recognizes the pattern as typical for SDK initialization.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The concern about `_patch_sdk()` executing code is valid but standard in SDKs, especially generated ones.  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors.  \n- Malware score=0 is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- The overall risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain obfuscated/malicious code snippets.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.2), reflecting minor concerns about wildcard imports and dynamic patching, but overall, the code is standard SDK boilerplate.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  Clear, generated code with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2  \n  Minor concerns about wildcard import and dynamic patching, but typical in SDKs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated SDK initialization module with no signs of malicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. The only potential concern is the use of wildcard import, which is common in SDKs but could be problematic if the imported module is compromised—though there's no evidence of that here.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- Set a very low risk score (~0.1), reflecting standard SDK patterns.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, risk scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's benign, boilerplate nature.",
