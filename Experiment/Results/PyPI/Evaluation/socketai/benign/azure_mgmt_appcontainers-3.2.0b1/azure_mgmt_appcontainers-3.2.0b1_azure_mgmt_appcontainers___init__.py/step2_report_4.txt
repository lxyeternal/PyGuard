  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard SDK setup, importing modules, setting version info, and applying patches. No external or untrusted sources involved.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or external input processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) could introduce unexpected symbols but is common in SDK patching.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is typical SDK boilerplate, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The wildcard import, while a minor concern, is standard in such contexts.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low risk). This seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the auto-generated nature and typical SDK setup.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data, no suspicious patterns, minor concern about wildcard import but common in generated SDKs.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on dynamic import and patch application, again typical in SDK code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no external data processing, just standard setup routines.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. This seems justified.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar pattern, emphasizing standard SDK initialization.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, wildcard import is a common pattern here.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Describes the same SDK setup, with focus on the `_patch_sdk()` call.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, the code is typical SDK bootstrap code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Slightly lower risk, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is purely setup and initialization, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the minor concern about wildcard imports and dynamic patching, but overall very low risk.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports and their reasoning)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated SDK initialization script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of wildcard imports and dynamic patching is typical in such generated code and does not indicate malicious behavior. The low risk score is appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis analysis confirms the code's safety profile based on the provided reports.",
