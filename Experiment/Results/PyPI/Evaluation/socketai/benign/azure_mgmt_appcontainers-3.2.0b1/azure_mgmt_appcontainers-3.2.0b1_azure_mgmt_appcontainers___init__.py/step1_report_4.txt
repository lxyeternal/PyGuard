{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures imports for a Python SDK, setting up versioning and patching mechanisms for the Microsoft Container Apps API client.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_container_apps_api_client, _version, _patch), and the version variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external input; the code primarily manages imports and configurations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code does not handle external input or perform data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can introduce unpredictable namespace pollution, but this is a common pattern in SDK setup; no other suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be part of an SDK setup script. It imports internal modules, sets version info, and dynamically imports optional patches. The use of wildcard import is noteworthy but typical in auto-generated SDK code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. No external data input handling or network activity is observed. The code is straightforward and primarily for SDK configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK initialization script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard import is a minor concern but not malicious in this context.",
