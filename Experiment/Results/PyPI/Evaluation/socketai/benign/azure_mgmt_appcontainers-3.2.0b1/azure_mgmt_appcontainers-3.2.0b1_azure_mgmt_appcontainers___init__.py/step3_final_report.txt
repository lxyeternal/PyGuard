  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> setting version -> conditional import of _patch symbols -> calling _patch_sdk()",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from _patch module, which can be risky but is common in SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK bootstrap script. It performs module imports, sets version info, conditionally imports patch symbols, and executes a patch function. No external data, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The wildcard import from _patch is typical in SDKs but could be exploited if the module is compromised. The call to _patch_sdk() is a standard extension point. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to the wildcard import and dynamic patching, which are common in generated SDK code but could be exploited if modules are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of wildcard import and dynamic patching are typical in such contexts and do not indicate malicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
