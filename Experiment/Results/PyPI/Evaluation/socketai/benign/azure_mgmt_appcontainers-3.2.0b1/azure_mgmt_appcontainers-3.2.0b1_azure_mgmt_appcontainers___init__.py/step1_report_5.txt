  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python module for the Microsoft Container Apps SDK, setting up imports, versioning, and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (_container_apps_api_client, _version, _patch), and assignment of __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "Execution of _patch_sdk() function, which may execute code from imported modules.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> setting __version__ -> attempting to import _patch._all -> calling _patch_sdk()",
  "anomalies": "Unusual dynamic import of all symbols from _patch; potential for executing unintended code if _patch contains malicious code, but standard in generated SDK code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard generated SDK module setup, importing necessary components, handling optional patch imports, and invoking a patching function. The use of try-except for optional import is common. The call to _patch_sdk() is a typical extension point for SDK modifications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The structure aligns with typical SDK initialization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SDK module bootstrap with no malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code were identified. The code's design is consistent with generated SDK code for Azure services.",
