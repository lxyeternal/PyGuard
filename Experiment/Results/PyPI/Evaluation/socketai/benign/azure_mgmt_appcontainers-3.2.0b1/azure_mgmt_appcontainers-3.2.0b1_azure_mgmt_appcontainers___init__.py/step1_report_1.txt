  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up and initialize parts of a Python SDK client for container applications, importing modules, setting version info, and applying patches.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (. _container_apps_api_client, . _version, . _patch). No external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform risky operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, assigning version info, conditionally importing patch functions, and executing a patch function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from ._patch import *' can potentially introduce unintended code but is a common pattern in SDK patching. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the SDK environment, handling imports and applying patches. The conditional import of patches with a fallback on ImportError is standard. The use of wildcard import could be risky if external code controls the patch module, but in this context, it's typical for SDK patching and not inherently malicious. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified. The code does not process external input or perform any network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK initialization script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The use of wildcard import warrants cautious review but is a common SDK pattern. Overall, the code appears safe.",
