  "purpose": "Define and manage blackbox functions for use within a constraint programming model, allowing evaluation of functions with unknown or complex analytical forms.",
  "sources": "Reading input data occurs in the constructor (__init__) when setting argument types, function name, and implementation. Data is also retrieved from the implementation function during evaluation (_eval_function). Argument values are processed in build_model_call and __call__ methods. Argument types are validated in _update_check_arg_types.",
  "sinks": "The implementation function (impl) is called in _eval_function with arguments processed from the model. The results are returned directly to the solver. No explicit sinks for untrusted data are visible; the user provides the implementation, which is executed as-is.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from user-defined argument inputs into the build_model_call or __call__ methods. These are transformed into expressions and passed to the implementation function. The implementation’s output is returned directly, potentially influencing the model's constraints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The implementation function is user-supplied and directly invoked, which could be risky if untrusted code is provided as the implementation. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors within this code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class structure for blackbox functions, including configuration, argument handling, and invocation mechanisms. It validates argument types, manages caching options, and constructs expression nodes for the solver. The implementation function is stored and invoked directly with supplied arguments, which could be a vector for malicious code if provided by an untrusted user. No network, file operations, or external data leaks are evident. The code is a typical wrapper for user-defined functions with no embedded malicious behavior, but it relies on the user to supply safe implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard API for defining blackbox functions in a constraint programming context. It does not contain malicious behavior itself; however, it executes user-supplied functions directly, which could be a security risk if those functions are untrusted. There are no signs of malware or sabotage within this module.",
