{
  "purpose": "The code provides a diagnostic report on the execution environment for the 'docplex.cp' module, including system info, package versions, and solver configuration.",
  "sources": "System modules (platform, sys, os), internal package modules (version, config, utils, solver, init), configuration files for solver executables/libraries.",
  "sinks": "Output stream (stdout or provided stream) where environment info and warnings are written.",
  "flows": "System info and package data are collected from modules and written directly to the output stream; no external data transmission or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. File checks are standard diagnostics, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers environment details, verifies the existence and executability of solver files, and reports any issues. It uses standard Python modules and internal package functions. No external network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for diagnostics. The file checks are benign and serve to warn about misconfigurations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment diagnostic utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals point to a safe, standard utility. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
