  "purpose": "The code generates a report on the environment in which the docplex.cp module is used, including system info, Python version, optional packages, and solver configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform and sys modules, reads environment configuration via init and config modules, checks file existence and executability via utils and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs report data to a stream (stdout or provided stream); checks for executable or library files, but does not execute or modify them.",
  "flows": "Collects system info and configuration data, then writes formatted report strings to the output stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks and prints diagnostic info. It utilizes helper functions to verify file existence and executability, and reports system details, package versions, and solver configurations. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network connections, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and focused solely on environment reporting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign environment diagnostic code with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reports environment details for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.",
