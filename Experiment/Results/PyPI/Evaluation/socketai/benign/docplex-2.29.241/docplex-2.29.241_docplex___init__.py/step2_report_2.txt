  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code and the reasoning behind the security assessments.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code snippets are straightforward, consisting solely of import statements and variable assignments related to package version info.\n- There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data processing, or external communication.\n- The license comments and import statements are standard for package metadata setup.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard package metadata initialization; no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high, given the simplicity and standard nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Same reasoning as Report 1, with similar conclusions.\n- **Scores:** All reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same as above; straightforward import and assignment.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same assessment; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion; purely package setup code.\n- **Scores:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- **Are there any issues with the code?**  \n  No. The code is purely for setting version info, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Potential for false positives?**  \n  No, given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** should remain at **0** for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated scores** should be **0**.\n- The **security risk scores** should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the consistent, straightforward nature of this code, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThere are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a standard package metadata setup, common in many Python packages.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall security assessment should be that this code poses no security risk.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0**",
