  "purpose": "Initialize and expose package version information for the 'docplex' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'docplex.version' module retrieving version strings and components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no sinks involved; code only assigns imported data to variables.",
  "flows": "Import of version info → assignment to variables (__version__, __version_info__).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and assignment with license comments; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package metadata setup, importing version info from a local module and assigning it to variables. It contains no external input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is clear, standard, and benign. All signals point to a benign initialization script with no security risks or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are correct, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
