  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, step-by-step, to verify their conclusions and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippets are simple import statements and variable assignments related to package versioning.\n- No input from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is standard package metadata initialization, with license comments, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, importing version info from a local module, and assigning it to variables.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security risks is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the reports' assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the scores:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.  \n- The code is purely for version info setup, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n\n- Since no malicious behavior is observed or claimed, malware score remains at 0.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling are present.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis.  \n- Given the simplicity and the standard nature of the code, this assumption is valid.  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Estimated risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a straightforward package version initialization snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence.",
