  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward package initialization snippet that imports version info from a local module and assigns it to variables.\n- There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or external communication.\n- The code is standard, with license comments and import statements.\n- All reports agree on benign intent, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed findings:\n- The code matches the original snippet.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code.\n\n### Potential issues or mistakes:\n- **No issues detected** in logic, reasoning, or scoring.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk (0):** No external data, no dynamic behavior, no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is benign, standard package setup.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code's simplicity supports these scores.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring is appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.",
