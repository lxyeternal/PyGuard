  "purpose": "Static version information variables for a package, auto-generated for metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "File reading static variable assignments and comments; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments with no dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with licensing comments and version variables.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments indicating version numbers, with licensing comments and a generated code note. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely metadata, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals point to benign, auto-generated version info. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and confidence is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and no modifications are necessary.",
