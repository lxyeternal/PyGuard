{
  "purpose": "This code sets version-related variables for a library or package, providing metadata about the version of 'docplex' and 'cplex'.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variables defining version numbers and a license comment at the top.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static data assigned to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of generated code indicator and license comment; no suspicious or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license information and auto-generated version variables. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. The variables define static version info, which is common in package metadata. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The presence of 'gendoc: ignore' suggests documentation generation directives, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving only to store version metadata with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected.",
