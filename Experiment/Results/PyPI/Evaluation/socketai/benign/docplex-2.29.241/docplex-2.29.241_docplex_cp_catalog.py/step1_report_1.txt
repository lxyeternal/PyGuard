  "purpose": "Define Python classes and constants representing CPO types, parameters, signatures, and operations for use in a constraint programming context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class constructors, class attributes, and module-level data structures (like type lists and operation lists). It also reads type definitions and operation signatures from predefined data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that may process or evaluate data, such as __str__, __eq__, and internal functions like _compute_all_type_links, which manipulate type links and common types. These do not process untrusted input directly but are involved in type management.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and their relationships are computed via _compute_all_type_links, which links types and computes common types, potentially involving recursive or dynamic references. Operations are linked to signatures, which could involve dynamic signatures. However, no untrusted data is input, and the code primarily constructs internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive definitions of types and operations with detailed signatures. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The presence of many internal link computations could be complex but are standard for type hierarchies. No code appears to perform network access, file system manipulation, or system command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes data classes and constants for a type and operation system within a constraint programming framework. It contains no code for executing external commands, network communication, or data exfiltration. The functions and class methods are straightforward, involving data structure setup and management, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The complexity is due to type and operation management, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a structured setup for type and operation descriptors, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger constraint programming system. The code only defines internal data structures and performs type linking, with no external or suspicious activity.",
