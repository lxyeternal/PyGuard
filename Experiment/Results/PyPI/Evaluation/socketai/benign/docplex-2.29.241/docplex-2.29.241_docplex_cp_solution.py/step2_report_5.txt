  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes classes and functions for managing solver results, solutions, conflicts, and metadata.\n- **Sources:** Reads JSON data, internal attributes, and parameters.\n- **Sinks:** Outputs logs, solutions, conflicts, and JSON data via file and stdout.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from JSON and internal attributes into data structures, then to output.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard for solver result management, with no malicious behavior. It handles data parsing, storage, and output formatting responsibly.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk; no malware or sabotage indications.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Report 2 & 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Empty responses, no data provided.\n- **Analysis:** Cannot evaluate; no code or details.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, defines classes/functions for solver results, solutions, conflicts.\n- **Sources:** JSON parsing, input parameters, internal variables.\n- **Sinks:** Outputs logs, solutions, conflicts to files/streams.\n- **Flows:** JSON data into internal structures, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, no code injection, no obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard implementation for managing solver outputs; safe data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; code is safe.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines classes/functions for handling solver results, solutions, conflicts.\n- **Sources:** JSON input, internal attributes.\n- **Sinks:** Outputs logs, solutions, conflict info.\n- **Flows:** JSON data into data structures; no code execution from JSON.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, safe data management code.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- The code is consistently about parsing JSON data, managing internal data structures, and outputting results.\n- No dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec), network calls, or hidden behaviors are present.\n- JSON parsing functions (_get_expr_from_map, _add_json_solution, etc.) are standard and do not perform unsafe operations.\n- File operations are limited to reading/writing local files.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.\n- The overall structure and purpose align with typical solver result management modules.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware risk:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to JSON parsing, which is standard)\n\n### Suggested scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Note:** The low risk score reflects the fact that while the code handles data parsing and output, it does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAfter carefully reviewing all reports and the code, I confirm that the code is a standard, well-structured implementation for managing solver results, solutions, and conflicts. It processes JSON data safely, outputs logs and solutions responsibly, and contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Overall security risk: **0.1**",
