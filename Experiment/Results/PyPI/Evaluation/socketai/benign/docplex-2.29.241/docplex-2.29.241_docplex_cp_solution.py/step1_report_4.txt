  "purpose": "This module defines classes and functions to represent and process the results of a constraint programming solver, including solutions, conflicts, and solver information.",
  "sources": "Reads data from JSON objects (e.g., _get_domain, _get_interval, _get_num_value), input parameters, and model expressions. Also reads configuration and solver status from internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs solver logs, solutions, conflicts, and JSON formatted data via write methods, and writes to files or stdout. Uses input data for setting variable solutions and constraints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input (via _add_json_solution) into internal data structures, from model expressions to solution objects, and from solutions to output streams. JSON parsing and data conversion functions transform external data into internal representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Code performs data parsing, object instantiation, and output formatting without unusual constructs. The use of dynamic JSON data and object mapping is standard for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of data structures and functions for managing solver results, solutions, and conflicts in a constraint programming context. It includes methods for JSON parsing (_add_json_solution, _create_from_json, etc.), data conversion (_get_domain, _get_num_value), and output formatting (write, print_solution). There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or harmful network activity. The code primarily manipulates internal data and outputs logs and solutions to files or stdout. The functions like _get_expr_from_map, which retrieves model expressions from a map, perform necessary validation but do not execute any malicious or suspicious actions. All data flows are consistent with the purpose of managing solver results. No use of system commands, network access, or dangerous code constructs is present. The code is structured, typical for a solver result processing module, and adheres to expected patterns for such software.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of result data structures and JSON parsing routines for a constraint programming solver. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The functions perform data handling, formatting, and output tasks without executing external code or sensitive operations. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy within the scope of its functionality.",
