{
  "purpose": "The code manages solver results, solutions, conflicts, and metadata through classes and functions that parse JSON inputs, store data, and output formatted results. It provides a structured API for handling the output of a constraint programming solver.",
  "sources": "JSON data inputs, internal attributes, method parameters, and expression maps used during JSON parsing and data assignment.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as print, write, and file operations (open_utf8), which generate logs, solution summaries, and conflict descriptions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON inputs and internal attributes into class instances and data structures, then to output streams or files, with no external network or code execution involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard data handling and output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured API for managing solver results, with safe data parsing, storage, and output. It does not perform dynamic code execution, network operations, or any malicious activity. JSON parsing functions are standard, and file I/O is limited to local operations. No obfuscation or sabotage signs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, trustworthy, and does not pose any security threat. It is a standard implementation for solver result management with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
