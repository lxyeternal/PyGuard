  "purpose": "To provide an API for IBM Decision Optimization CPLEX Modeling in Python, with compatibility checks for platform and Python version.",
  "sources": "Imports (docplex.version, cplex, platform, sys, warnings), platform.system(), sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is written to external sources or network communications",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Compatibility checks are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment compatibility checks for platform and Python version. It imports necessary modules, handles missing 'cplex' gracefully, and issues warnings if system or Python version is unsupported. No external data is received or transmitted, and no code injection or malicious behavior is present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for such compatibility validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for ensuring environment compatibility for the IBM Decision Optimization API. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
