{
  "purpose": "The code implements a tokenizer for parsing CPO file format, converting input text into tokens for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input stream or string read via _next_char(), _peek_char(), and input.readline() methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flow occurs if tokens are used unsanitized downstream, but within this code, no unsafe sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from input stream to _next_char() and related methods, producing tokens through various _read_* functions, but there are no evident source-to-sink malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code uses standard token parsing logic, and character handlers are set explicitly for common token types.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard tokenizer implementation for a specific file format, with functions for reading symbols, numbers, strings, and operators. It manages input reading, character peeking, and token creation securely. No dynamic code execution, external calls, or network operations are present. It correctly handles end-of-file conditions and error reporting. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, well-structured tokenizer module with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The implementation appears safe and does not contain malware or suspicious flows.",
