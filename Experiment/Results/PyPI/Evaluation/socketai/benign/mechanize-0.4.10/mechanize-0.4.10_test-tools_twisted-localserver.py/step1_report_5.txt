{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a local web server for testing purposes, providing various pages with authentication, redirection, and cookie handling to support functional tests.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments (port number), and file reading (example.html). No untrusted external data sources are explicitly used within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs HTTP responses, sets cookies, redirects, and handles authentication, but does not process or inject untrusted data into critical operations beyond standard response generation.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> parse_options -> main -> server setup -> HTTP request handling with static pages, auth, redirection, cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials pose a security risk; the code includes standard test pages. No code appears malicious or to contain backdoors, malware, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a test server with multiple pages, including authentication-protected pages and redirects, primarily for testing web clients. It does not process or store untrusted user input beyond request headers and cookies, which are typical for such test environments. No external data sources or network communications to suspicious domains are present. The code does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a testing server setup script intended for functional testing scenarios. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contains no malware, and poses minimal security risk in its current form. It is safe for use in controlled testing environments.",
