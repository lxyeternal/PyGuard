{
  "purpose": "A local test server providing static and dynamic web pages, with authentication, cookies, redirects, and serving static files for functional testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads static HTML files from disk, handles HTTP headers, cookies, and authentication credentials in memory.",
  "sinks": "Serves HTTP responses with headers, cookies, and static/dynamic content; processes user input via request headers and cookies.",
  "flows": "HTTP request received -> authentication/cookie handling -> serving static/dynamic pages -> potential redirects or cookies set.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond test credentials; no obfuscated code; no external network calls or suspicious data flows; reading static files is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a test web server with pages for authentication (basic and digest), cookies, redirects, and static content. It reads HTML files from disk for serving test pages. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Credentials are for testing only and stored in memory. The server's purpose is to facilitate functional testing, not production deployment. No external network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The low risk and malware scores are justified given its benign, testing-oriented design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, testing utility server with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe operation within its intended testing environment.",
