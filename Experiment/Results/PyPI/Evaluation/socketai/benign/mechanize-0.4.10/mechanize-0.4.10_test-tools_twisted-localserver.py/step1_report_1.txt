{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a local HTTP server with various test pages, including authentication and cookie handling, primarily for functional testing of web client behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for port number; reads example HTML files from disk; processes request headers and cookies.",
  "sinks": "Outputs HTML content via HTTP responses; handles cookies and headers; processes authentication credentials.",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> server setup -> HTTP requests -> response generation including headers, cookies, and HTML content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials except for username 'john' in in-memory auth; no suspicious external network calls or data leaks; code appears to serve static or generated HTML content with authentication wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a web server with multiple endpoints, including authenticated pages, redirects, and cookie handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network communications indicative of malicious activity. Authentication uses in-memory credentials, which are safe within this context. The server primarily provides static or dynamically generated HTML for testing purposes. No hardcoded secrets besides basic username/password; no data exfiltration, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a test server for web client testing scenarios. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The overall security risk is minimal, with no indicators of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
