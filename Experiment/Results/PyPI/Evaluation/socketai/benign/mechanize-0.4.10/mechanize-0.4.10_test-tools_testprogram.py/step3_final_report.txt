  "purpose": "This code manages server processes (HTTP and FTP) for testing purposes, orchestrates test discovery and execution, and verifies server startup via socket connections. It is a test infrastructure script for the mechanize project.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, subprocess.Popen calls to spawn server scripts, socket.connect to localhost for server startup verification, and test discovery modules.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to run server scripts, socket connections to localhost, threading for process termination, and command-line parsing. No untrusted data flows or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Command-line args → server process spawn via subprocess → socket connection to verify server startup → test discovery and execution → process termination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard modules and patterns for server process management and testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical test harness managing local server processes, verifying their startup via socket connections, and orchestrating test discovery and execution. It employs subprocess for process control, socket for server verification, threading for process termination, and optparse for command-line options. No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign, standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test infrastructure script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
