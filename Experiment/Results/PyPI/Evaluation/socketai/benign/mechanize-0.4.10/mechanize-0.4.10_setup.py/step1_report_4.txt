  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for packaging a Python project",
  "sources": "The script imports setuptools and calls its setup() function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; setup() is used for package configuration",
  "flows": "Import setuptools -> call setup() with default parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script that imports setuptools and executes setup() with default parameters. It does not process input, handle data, or perform any runtime operations beyond initiating package setup. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard Python packaging setup file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
