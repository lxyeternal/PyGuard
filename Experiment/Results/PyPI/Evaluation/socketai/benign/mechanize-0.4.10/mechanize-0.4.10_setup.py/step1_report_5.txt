  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports setuptools and calls setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import setuptools and call setuptools.setup(), with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for package setup, with no suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a basic Python package setup file utilizing setuptools. It defines a main() function that calls setuptools.setup(), which is standard practice. There are no input reading, no processing of untrusted data, and no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated sections. The code's structure is simple and conventional, and it does not perform any operations beyond invoking a well-known setup function.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose in packaging Python modules.",
