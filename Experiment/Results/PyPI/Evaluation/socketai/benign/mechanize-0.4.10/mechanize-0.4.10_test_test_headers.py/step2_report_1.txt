  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely unit tests for header parsing functions. No external data, no network, no dynamic code execution. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, safe, and standard testing code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes straightforward unit tests for header parsing functions. No external or untrusted data processing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Also safe, with no indications of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, testing functions for header parsing and HTML detection, with static data. No external data flows, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) perhaps due to conservative default, but no actual malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, standard unit tests with static data, no external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Safe, benign testing code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—unit tests for header parsing with static data, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, Obfuscated: 0.0, Security Risk: 0.0\n- **Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is strictly for testing header parsing functions with static data. **Estimated malware score: 0.0**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present. The code is straightforward and readable. **Estimated obfuscated score: 0.0**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is conservative. Given the nature of the code (unit tests, no external data, no system modifications), a risk score of **0.0** is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a set of static, well-structured unit tests for header parsing utilities. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk score (0.0) reflects the absence of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** **0.0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code as purely testing utilities.",
