  "purpose": "Unit tests for the mechanize._headersutil module, testing header parsing and related functions.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; the code uses hardcoded header strings for testing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to system actions, network, or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely processes static test data without input/output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code strictly performs testing of header parsing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of unit tests for functions in the mechanize._headersutil module, specifically testing header parsing, string manipulation, and header-related utilities. It does not handle any external or untrusted input; all data is static test strings. There are no code injection points, network activity, or malicious payloads. The functions tested involve string processing, which are standard and benign. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for header utility functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely exercises parsing logic with hardcoded test data, posing no threat. Overall, the code is safe.",
