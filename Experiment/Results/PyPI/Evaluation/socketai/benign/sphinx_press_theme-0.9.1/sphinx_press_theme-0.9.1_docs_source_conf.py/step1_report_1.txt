  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder, specifying project info, themes, extensions, and output formats.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; static configuration data defined in the script.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assigned to variables and dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is purely configuration for documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, defining project details, themes, extensions, and output options. It contains no external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code adheres to typical patterns expected in a configuration script. The presence of commented-out imports and options indicates optional configurability but nothing malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious intent or security risks.",
