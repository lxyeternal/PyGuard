  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, package data, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; defines package metadata, package data, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution.",
  "flows": "Read from README.md → setup() parameters; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious patterns. It reads a README file, sets package info, data, dependencies, and URLs. No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report appears an overestimation; the overall assessment is that the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. All reports are accurate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0. The minor elevation to 0.1 is unnecessary. Overall, the package is safe, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.",
