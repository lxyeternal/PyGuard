  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no external data, dependencies, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain any anomalies. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior.",
