{
  "purpose": "Define static package data files for the 'google-stubs' package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only references predefined file paths in 'package_data'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leak operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with a 'package_data' argument listing numerous protobuf stub files and metadata. It contains no dynamic code, no user input handling, no network activity, and no executable logic. All reports agree that this is a benign static configuration script. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, justified by the absence of any malicious or risky behavior. The code's purpose is purely to specify static package data files, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security issues. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate.",
