  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a standard setup script that uses setuptools to specify static package data files for the 'google-stubs' package.\n- No external data, dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks detected.\n- The core logic is just a static declaration of package data files, mainly protobuf stub files and metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, accurate, and thorough in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Is there any reason to assign a higher malware or security risk score?**  \n  No. The code only specifies static package data files; there are no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified as 0?**  \n  Yes. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Are any assumptions about vulnerabilities justified?**  \n  No. The code is static configuration, not dynamic or input-driven.\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions.**  \n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security issues.  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign package setup script. No issues, no risks, no malware. The current scoring is appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
