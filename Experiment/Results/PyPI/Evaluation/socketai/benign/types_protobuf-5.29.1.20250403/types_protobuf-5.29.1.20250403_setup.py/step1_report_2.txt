  "purpose": "To configure package data files for the 'google-stubs' package during installation using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data files specified in the 'package_data' argument, including numerous protobuf interface files (.pyi) and a METADATA.toml file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present; the code solely specifies static package data for installation.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static data for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward setup configuration with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. It only lists static file paths.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet uses setuptools' setup function to declare package data files for distribution. It includes no user input, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling. All listed files are static and part of the package content, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies files to include in the package distribution.",
