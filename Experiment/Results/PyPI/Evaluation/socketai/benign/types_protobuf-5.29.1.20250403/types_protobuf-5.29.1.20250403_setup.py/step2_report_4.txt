  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward setup script using setuptools to specify static package data files.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, network activity, or sensitive operations are identified.\n- The package data files are related to protobuf stub files and metadata, which are typical for a package like 'google-stubs'.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are reported or evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it imports `setup` from `setuptools` and calls `setup()` with a `package_data` argument listing static files.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- All reports agree on benign intent and implementation.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are present in the code.\n- The code is standard and correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware**: 0\n  - **obfuscated**: 0\n  - **securityRisk**: 0\n  - **confidence**: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Risk Justification:\n- The code is purely static configuration with no execution of untrusted code, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no network activity.\n- The only potential concern could be if the listed files contained malicious content, but that is outside the scope of this setup script review.\n- The scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- All claims are consistent with the evidence: static, benign package data listing.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are warranted.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risks associated with static package data configuration.\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is a typical setup configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard setup script specifying static package data files for distribution. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**End of review.**",
