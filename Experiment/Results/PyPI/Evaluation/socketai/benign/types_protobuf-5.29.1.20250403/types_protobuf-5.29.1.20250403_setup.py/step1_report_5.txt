{
  "purpose": "The code defines the package data files to be included in a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The source is the call to setup() which reads no external input; the data files listed are static package resources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration for package data inclusion; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The data files are typical for protobuf-related package distribution, and no suspicious or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the setuptools.setup() function solely to specify package_data for inclusion in a Python package. All listed files are related to protobuf type stubs and metadata, with no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard and straightforward for package setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely for configuring package data files. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
