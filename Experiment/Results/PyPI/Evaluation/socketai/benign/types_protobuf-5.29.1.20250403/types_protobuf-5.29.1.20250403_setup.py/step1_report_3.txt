{
  "purpose": "The code sets up package data for the 'google-stubs' package using setuptools, specifying various protobuf stub files and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'setuptools' library import and the hardcoded 'package_data' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static package_data dictionary into the setup() function, which uses it for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls setup() with a predefined dictionary for package_data. The package_data specifies static file paths for protobuf stubs and metadata files. There are no user inputs, environment variables, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected. The code follows standard practices for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script configuring package data for distribution. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
