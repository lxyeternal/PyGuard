{
  "purpose": "This code defines a generic visitor class for an SQL parse tree generated by ANTLR, providing visit methods for various SQL syntax components.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own class definitions and method parameters (parse tree contexts) but does not take external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present. The code primarily defines method stubs for parse tree traversal.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the methods are placeholders for traversing parse trees without performing operations or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard ANTLR visitor class with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. It solely provides method hooks without implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated from an ANTLR grammar with typical visitor pattern methods. It contains no executable logic, data manipulation, or system commands. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage is evident. Its structure and content align with standard parser visitor classes.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a boilerplate ANTLR visitor class for SQL parsing, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves as a scaffold for further implementation but does not contain any harmful or suspicious code.",
