{
  "purpose": "Generated parse tree visitor class for SQL syntax, facilitating traversal and processing of parsed SQL statements.",
  "sources": "Imports from antlr4 and local sqlParser module, class and method definitions for various parse tree nodes, no input data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Method calls that recursively visit child nodes; no data flows involving external inputs or outputs; purely structural traversal.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for parse tree visiting; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated visitor class for SQL parse trees from ANTLR. It defines methods to traverse each parse node, with no embedded logic or data manipulation. There are no external inputs, data leaks, or command executions. Its structure and content are typical of code generated by parser generators, and it lacks any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate parse tree visitor generated from ANTLR for SQL syntax. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is structural traversal, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage intent.",
