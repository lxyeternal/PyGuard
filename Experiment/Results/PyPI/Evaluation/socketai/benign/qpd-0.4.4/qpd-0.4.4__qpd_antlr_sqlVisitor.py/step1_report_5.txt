{
  "purpose": "This code defines a generic visitor class for a SQL parse tree generated by ANTLR, intended for traversing or processing SQL statements.",
  "sources": "The class methods receive context objects (ctx) from the sqlParser; no external input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or executed; the code does not perform any data manipulation, storage, or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code; it only defines visitor methods that delegate to visitChildren.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present; the code is straightforward, with standard method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a visitor pattern for a parse tree, generated from a SQL grammar. It contains only method stubs that delegate to visitChildren, which is typical and non-malicious. No external data is read, processed, or transmitted. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or network activity. The code's structure and content suggest it is a generated, boilerplate class for traversing parse trees.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a generated, non-malicious visitor class with no suspicious or malicious content. It performs no harmful actions, contains no secrets or backdoors, and is standard in parser implementations. Its purpose is to facilitate SQL parse tree traversal, not to perform any security-sensitive operations.",
