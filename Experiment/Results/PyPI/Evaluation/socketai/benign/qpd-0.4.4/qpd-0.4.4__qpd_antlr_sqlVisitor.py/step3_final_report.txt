{
  "purpose": "This code defines an auto-generated ANTLR visitor class for traversing SQL parse trees, with each method delegating to visitChildren. It serves as a structural scaffold for further processing of SQL syntax trees.",
  "sources": "The code imports the parser module and the standard antlr4 library; it does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no output operations, network activity, or system commands; the code only performs recursive traversal calls.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to recursive method calls within the parse tree traversal; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, with no embedded logic beyond delegation to visitChildren. All five reviews agree that it is benign, with high confidence. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated parse tree visitor for SQL syntax, posing no security risks or malicious intent. It can be confidently used as part of a larger SQL parsing system without concerns about sabotage or malware.",
  "confidence": 1,
