{
  "purpose": "This code defines a generic visitor class for a SQL parse tree generated by ANTLR, providing methods to traverse and process SQL syntax components.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a class with methods for visiting parse tree nodes.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; no external connections or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The class methods are designed to traverse a parse tree; no data flows outside the method calls or are manipulated in a suspicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. It is a straightforward visitor class without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external dependencies beyond standard ANTLR-generated classes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports ANTLR runtime, conditionally imports a parser module, and then defines a subclass of ParseTreeVisitor with methods to visit various parse tree node types generated by a SQL grammar. These methods simply call visitChildren on the context objects, serving as placeholders for further processing. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network access, system modifications, or secret handling, is present. The structure is typical for a parser visitor, indicating a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of an ANTLR visitor for SQL parse trees. It contains no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks. It merely facilitates traversal of SQL syntax trees for further processing or analysis. No security issues or malware are detected.",
