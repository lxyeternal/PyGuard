  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Purpose:** All reports agree that this code is an auto-generated, boilerplate ANTLR parse tree visitor for SQL syntax. Its role is to traverse parse trees, not to process data or execute commands.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external input, data processing, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- **Flows:** The methods only delegate to `visitChildren`, with no data flow outside the class.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports consistently identify this as benign, standard parser boilerplate code with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are there any issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is purely structural, auto-generated, and contains no executable logic beyond method stubs.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign, auto-generated visitor class for SQL parse trees.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n- No need for score adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a harmless, boilerplate implementation of an ANTLR parse tree visitor for SQL syntax. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and exhibits no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
