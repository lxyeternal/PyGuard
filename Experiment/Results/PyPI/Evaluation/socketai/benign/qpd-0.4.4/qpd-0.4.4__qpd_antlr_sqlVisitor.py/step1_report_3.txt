{
  "purpose": "Generated parser visitor class for SQL syntax tree traversal, used in SQL query parsing and analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from antlr4 and sqlParser; class definition and method declarations for visiting parse tree nodes.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no execution of untrusted data, no network activity, file operations, or command execution found.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data streams or untrusted input directly; it merely defines visit methods that delegate to children nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of method stubs for parse tree traversal. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated visitor pattern implementation for a SQL parser. It contains only method definitions calling 'visitChildren' on context nodes, without any logic that could lead to malicious behavior. No input processing, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The structure and content are consistent with standard parser visitor classes. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated parser visitor with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a template for traversing SQL parse trees. No signs of sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities identified.",
