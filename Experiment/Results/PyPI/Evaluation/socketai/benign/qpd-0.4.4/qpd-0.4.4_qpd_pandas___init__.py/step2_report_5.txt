  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets, their context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports are based on minimal code: only import statements from `qpd_pandas.engine`.\n- No actual data processing, execution, or data flow is visible.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The only potential concern is the suppression of linting warnings (`# flake8: noqa`), which could hide code issues but is not inherently malicious.\n- The `malware` scores are all zero, aligning with the benign nature of the code snippets.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code snippets are simple import statements; no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, malicious intent, or data leaks.\n\n### Flaws or logical errors:\n- The reports assume that import statements alone are benign, which is generally true. However, if these imports are used in a malicious context elsewhere, that cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- The consistent use of the `# flake8: noqa` comment could potentially hide code quality issues, but not malicious activity.\n\n### Scores review:\n- The `malware` scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, which seems reasonable.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 or 1), which is justified given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- No higher risk scores are justified here due to the lack of executable code, data flow, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Potential issues with assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious activity based solely on import statements.\n- The suppression comment (`# flake8: noqa`) could obscure code issues but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable given the evidence.\n- Without additional context or code that executes or manipulates data, the risk remains minimal.\n- If these imports are used elsewhere maliciously, that would require further investigation, but from this snippet alone, no risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mainly due to suppression of lint warnings, which is not a security issue)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippets are benign import statements with no malicious or security concerns based on the provided information.",
