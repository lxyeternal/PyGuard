  "purpose": "Import statements from the qpd_pandas.engine module, likely for data processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the qpd_pandas.engine module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present; no data processing or output shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of '# flake8: noqa' comment to suppress linting warnings; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The suppression comment is a common practice and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign import statements with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are consistent with the evidence. No further action or suspicion is warranted based on these snippets.",
