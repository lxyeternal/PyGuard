  "purpose": "Importing classes and functions from the qpd_pandas.engine module, likely for data processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from the qpd_pandas.engine module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A in this snippet; no data flow analysis possible with only imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present in the import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two entities from a third-party library (qpd_pandas.engine). There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or executable code that could indicate malicious behavior. The presence of a 'noqa' comment suppresses flake8 warnings but does not suggest malicious intent. Since the code is limited to imports, it cannot be assessed for malicious activity without further context.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements from a third-party library, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident in this fragment. No suspicious or malicious actions are detected.",
