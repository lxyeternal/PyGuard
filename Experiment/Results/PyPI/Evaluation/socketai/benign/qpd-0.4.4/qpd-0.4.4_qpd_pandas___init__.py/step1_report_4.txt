{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from the 'qpd_pandas.engine' module, likely for data processing or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'qpd_pandas.engine' module to access 'QPDPandasEngine' and 'run_sql_on_pandas'.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not contain any sinks; however, the imported functions/classes could be used elsewhere to execute SQL queries or process data, which might lead to potential risks if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flow cannot be fully determined from this snippet alone, as there are no calls or data manipulations shown. It only shows imports.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the comment '# flake8: noqa', which suppresses linting warnings. This may obscure code issues but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This minimal code snippet imports classes and functions from an external module. There are no input reads, no data processing, or untrusted data handling shown. The suppression comment indicates an attempt to bypass linting rules, possibly to hide code issues, but does not suggest malicious activity. Without additional context or usage, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code solely imports modules without executing any potentially harmful operations.",
