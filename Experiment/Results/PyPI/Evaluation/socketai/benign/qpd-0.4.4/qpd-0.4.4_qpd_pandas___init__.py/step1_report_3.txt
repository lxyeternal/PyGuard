  "purpose": "Importing specific classes and functions from the qpd_pandas.engine module, likely to perform data processing or SQL-like operations on pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Import statement from qpd_pandas.engine",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling identified in the provided code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow identified within the given code snippet, as it only imports modules",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual patterns; only an import statement present",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions related to pandas DataFrame operations from a third-party library. No input, data handling, or execution occurs within this snippet. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks in this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent, no anomalies, and no security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger codebase performing data analysis tasks.",
