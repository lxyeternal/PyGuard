  "purpose": "Import classes for SQL lexing, parsing, and visiting from internal or third-party module _qpd_antlr.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from _qpd_antlr modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static imports only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal module naming with leading underscores; presence of linter suppression comment (# flake8: noqa), but these are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no executable code, data processing, or network activity. The module naming suggests internal or private modules, which is common and not suspicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The minimal nature of the code indicates a very low security concern. The assigned malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward static imports and lack of suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving only static import statements from internal modules. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) reflecting the internal module context but no actual threat.",
