  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- The code is just an import statement from _qpd_antlr modules.\n- No data flow, no execution, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0 — justified, as only imports are present.\n- Confidence: 1 — justified given the straightforward nature.\n- **Verdict**: The assessment is accurate; no issues here.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.9).\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — possibly slightly high; just importing classes from an internal module doesn't pose a risk.\n- **Verdict**: The low security risk score is acceptable, but perhaps a 0.0 would be more precise, as no activity is shown.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- Same pattern: straightforward imports.\n- Slight note on the module naming with underscores, but not suspicious.\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Verdict**: Accurate.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- Same import pattern.\n- The mention of a linter suppression comment is noted but not suspicious.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- Same analysis.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.2 — perhaps slightly high; only static imports.\n- **Verdict**: Acceptable, though a 0.1 or 0.0 might be more precise.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that these are benign import statements with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all appropriately zero.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature, though some are slightly conservative (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2).\n\n### Final assessment:\n- Based on the code snippets and reports, **the actual malware score should be 0** for all.\n- The **obfuscated score should remain 0**, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The **risk score** could be uniformly set to **0.0 or 0.1** to reflect the benign, static import nature.\n\n### Critical note:\n- The reports are thorough and cautious, which is good.\n- The only potential concern is the module naming with underscores, but that alone doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — the code is benign and only involves static imports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessment; no security issues are present in this code snippet.",
