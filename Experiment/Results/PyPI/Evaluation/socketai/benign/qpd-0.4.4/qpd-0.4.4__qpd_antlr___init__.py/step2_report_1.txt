  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports are about straightforward import statements from an internal or third-party module `_qpd_antlr`.\n- No code execution, data flow, or dynamic behavior is shown.\n- The module naming with leading underscores suggests internal or private modules, which is not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0 across the board, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern based solely on imports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that this code is only importing classes from `_qpd_antlr`. There are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n  The reports generally assume that import statements alone are benign, which is correct. They also note the unusual module naming but do not overstate risk.  \n  No significant errors are evident. The only minor point is that the reports sometimes mention potential sinks or data flows that are not present, but they acknowledge the lack of such flows.\n\n- **Scores assessment:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code.  \n  Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal risk from static imports.  \n  The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9–1), which is reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  None of the code snippets suggest malicious intent or exploitable vulnerabilities. Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Obfuscation and anomalies:**  \n  No obfuscation detected; the use of `# flake8: noqa` is a common linter directive, not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the provided code snippets and reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, but not higher.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1    |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, benign import of SQL processing classes. Without further context or usage, there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf future code includes actual usage of these classes—especially if it involves dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling—then re-evaluation would be warranted.",
