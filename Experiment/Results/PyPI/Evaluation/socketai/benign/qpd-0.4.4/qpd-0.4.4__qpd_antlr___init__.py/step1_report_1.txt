{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import components related to SQL lexing, parsing, and visiting, likely for processing or analyzing SQL statements.",
  "sources": "Imports from _qpd_antlr module: sqlLexer, sqlParser, sqlVisitor",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown in this snippet; potential flow would depend on how imported classes are used later",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal or third-party _qpd_antlr module; no evident malicious code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the _qpd_antlr package, which is likely an internal or third-party package for SQL processing. No input/output handling, data processing, or command execution is visible. The code is straightforward and only involves importing modules, which by itself is not suspicious. Without further context or usage, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement for SQL parsing components, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this code.",
