  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on simple import statements from an internal or third-party module `_qpd_antlr`.\n- No actual execution, data handling, or suspicious activity is shown.\n- The module naming with leading underscores suggests internal or private modules, which warrants some caution but is not inherently malicious.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that there is no malicious activity or security risk, with very low malware scores and minimal security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issue presence:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code only performs imports and does not process data or execute logic. No issues are present in the code itself.\n- **Malicious code or obfuscation:** No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent is detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Since the code is only static imports, there are no vulnerabilities in this snippet.\n\n### Flaws or reasoning errors:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The use of `_qpd_antlr` modules is noted as unconventional but not suspicious.\n- The mention of the `flake8` directive is benign; it’s common to suppress style warnings.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0.1 or 0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** 0, appropriate since no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly 0.9 or 1, reflecting high confidence in the benign assessment.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code only imports internal modules for SQL processing, and no malicious activity is evident, scores above 0.5 are unwarranted.\n- The module naming with leading underscores could suggest internal use, but alone does not imply risk.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities without concrete evidence.\n- The presence of the linter suppression comment (`# flake8: noqa`) is benign in this context.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation evident.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Overall, the code appears benign and safe.** The reports are consistent and justified in their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf I were to assign scores independently, I would align with the current low scores, perhaps with a slight increase in security risk (e.g., 0.1) due to the use of internal modules, but nothing warrants concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no security implications. The current assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
