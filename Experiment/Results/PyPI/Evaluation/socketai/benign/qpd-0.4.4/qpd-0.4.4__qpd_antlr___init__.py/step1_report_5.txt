{
  "purpose": "The code imports components from the _qpd_antlr package, likely for parsing or analyzing SQL statements.",
  "sources": "Import statements from _qpd_antlr.sqlLexer, _qpd_antlr.sqlParser, and _qpd_antlr.sqlVisitor",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported classes for executing or analyzing SQL, possibly affecting system behavior if misused",
  "flows": "Imports imported classes; further code (not provided) would use these classes to process input data",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a flake8 directive to ignore style warnings; no other anomalies are apparent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "This fragment solely imports classes from an antlr-generated package for SQL processing. There is no execution, input reading, or data handling shown here. The use of '_qpd_antlr' suggests it may be used for parsing or analysis, which is typical in SQL tools or analysis scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are evident in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import setup for a SQL parsing or analysis tool. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent based solely on these import statements.",
