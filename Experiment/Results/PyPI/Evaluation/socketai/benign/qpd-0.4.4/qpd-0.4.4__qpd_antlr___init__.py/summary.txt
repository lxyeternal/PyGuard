  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving only static import statements from internal modules. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) reflecting the internal module context but no actual threat."
