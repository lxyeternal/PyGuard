  "purpose": "Importing specific functions and classes from the qpd_ray.engine module, likely for use in further processing or computation.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'qpd_ray.engine' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present within this small snippet, as it only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this minimal code snippet. The code is straightforward and lacks suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement, importing 'QPDRayEngine' and 'run_sql_on_ray' from 'qpd_ray.engine'. There are no data inputs, no execution of untrusted code, and no apparent malicious behavior. The import statement itself is benign, assuming the module is legitimate and trusted. No hidden or obfuscated code is present. The line includes a linter directive to ignore noqa, which is common and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard import statement. No malicious intent or security threat is detected.",
