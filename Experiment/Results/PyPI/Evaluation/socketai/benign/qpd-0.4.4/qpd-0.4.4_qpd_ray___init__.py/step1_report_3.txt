{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from the qpd_ray.engine module, likely for further processing or execution related to ray-based computations or SQL operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing QPDRayEngine and run_sql_on_ray from qpd_ray.engine",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in this fragment; potential sinks depend on how imported functions are used later in the code",
  "flows": "Import of modules may lead to execution of functions or methods from qpd_ray.engine; actual flow depends on subsequent code, which is not provided",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors present in the provided snippet; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with a comment to ignore flake8 warnings. It imports two symbols from an external module. Without further context, there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The presence of imports alone does not indicate malicious intent but depends on their usage. No anomalies such as obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears to be a standard module import in preparation for further operations.",
