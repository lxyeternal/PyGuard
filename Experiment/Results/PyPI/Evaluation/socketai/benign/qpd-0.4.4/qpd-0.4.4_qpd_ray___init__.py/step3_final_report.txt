{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions/classes from the 'qpd_ray.engine' module, likely for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'qpd_ray.engine' module to load 'QPDRayEngine' and 'run_sql_on_ray'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve 'run_sql_on_ray' executing SQL commands, which might lead to data leaks or injection if misused, but no such execution occurs here.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'qpd_ray.engine'; the sink could be the use of 'run_sql_on_ray' in subsequent code that executes SQL commands or handles untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The import of 'QPDRayEngine' and 'run_sql_on_ray' does not inherently pose risks; potential concerns depend on their usage elsewhere. The confidence in benign intent is high (0.9), given the simplicity. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, with no obfuscation detected. The security risk score is low (0.1), acknowledging potential misuse if functions are used maliciously later, but not in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal content.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
