  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor concern about 'assert' does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the 'assert' statement's potential bypass. Overall, the package is safe and appropriate for use."
