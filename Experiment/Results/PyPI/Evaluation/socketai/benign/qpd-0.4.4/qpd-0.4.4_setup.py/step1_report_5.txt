{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library named 'qpd'. It configures package metadata, dependencies, and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RELEASE_TAG'; '__version__' imported from 'qpd_version'; reading 'README.md' file",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'RELEASE_TAG' influences the version string returned by 'get_version()'; no data flows lead to insecure operations or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup operations; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging libraries and a version module. It conditionally sets the package version based on an environment variable, which is typical for release management. It reads a Markdown file for long description, then calls 'setup()' with metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and package data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a typical and safe setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages versioning, dependencies, and metadata without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
