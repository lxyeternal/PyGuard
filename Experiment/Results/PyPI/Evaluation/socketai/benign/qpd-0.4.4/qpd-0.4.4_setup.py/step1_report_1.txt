{
  "purpose": "The script defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'qpd', including versioning, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (RELEASE_TAG), reads the README.md file, imports version info from qpd_version, and uses package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no system calls, network activity, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and version info influence package versioning; file reading impacts package description; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'RELEASE_TAG' to determine version is standard, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, reading environment variables, reading a README file, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. The get_version function dynamically determines the package version based on environment variables, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious data handling is observed. All activities are typical for a setup script, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It handles versioning, dependencies, and metadata in an expected manner without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
