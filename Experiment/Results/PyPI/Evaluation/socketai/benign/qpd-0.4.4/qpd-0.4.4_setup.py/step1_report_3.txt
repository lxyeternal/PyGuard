{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'qpd', including version handling, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'RELEASE_TAG', reading 'README.md', importing '__version__' from 'qpd_version'.",
  "sinks": "None directly indicate data leaks or malicious actions. No network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'RELEASE_TAG' influences version; version retrieval flows from environment or imported version; setup function uses this data to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs standard package setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging practices: importing modules, reading a README file, determining version with environment variable logic, and configuring setup parameters. The version check asserts consistency but is safe. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. All dependencies are standard, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
