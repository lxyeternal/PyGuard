{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'qpd' Python package, managing dependencies, metadata, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RELEASE_TAG', README.md file, local module '__version__'",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows present",
  "flows": "Environment variable and file read operations; version validation logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' for version check, which can be bypassed with Python optimizations but is benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It reads environment variables and files for configuration, imports version info, and sets package metadata. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. The use of 'assert' for version validation is standard but can be disabled, which is a minor concern but not malicious. The dependency declarations and package data are straightforward. Overall, the script is safe, well-structured, and free from security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor concern about 'assert' does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the 'assert' statement's potential bypass. Overall, the package is safe and appropriate for use.",
