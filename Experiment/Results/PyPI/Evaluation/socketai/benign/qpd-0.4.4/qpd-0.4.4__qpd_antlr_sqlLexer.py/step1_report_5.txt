{
  "purpose": "This code defines a lexer for SQL language parsing using ANTLR 4.11.1, including token definitions, rules, and properties for SQL syntax analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input character stream for tokenization, especially during lexing of SQL queries; uses _input.LA(1) for lookahead in some methods.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks of untrusted data leading to data leaks or effects; the code primarily performs token parsing without external communication or data handling beyond lexing.",
  "flows": "Input characters are read via _input.LA(1); flow of data is token recognition based on character streams, with no data flow to network or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Methods isHint() and isValidDecimal() are stubs returning fixed values (False and True respectively), with comments indicating 'TODO' and no actual logic. The properties 'legacy_setops_precedence_enbled' and 'legacy_exponent_literal_as_decimal_enabled' are set to fixed booleans, potentially indicating configurability but currently hardcoded. No code exhibits obfuscation or malicious logic; the code is straightforward and typical for a generated lexer.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated SQL lexer by ANTLR, including token definitions, mode and channel settings, and some property flags. The presence of functions like isHint() and isValidDecimal() with hardcoded returns and 'TODO' comments suggests placeholders or incomplete implementations, but they do not perform any malicious activity. The overall structure is consistent with a standard lexer, with no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code does not handle sensitive data directly, nor does it invoke unsafe operations, system calls, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical generated lexer for SQL parsing with no malicious behavior detected. The only minor concern is the presence of placeholder functions ('isHint', 'isValidDecimal') that are not fully implemented, but they pose no security risk. The code appears safe for use, with a malware score of 0 and a low security risk score.",
