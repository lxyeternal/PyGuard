  "purpose": "Evaluate the provided minimal Python import code for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'qpd_dask.engine' with a '# flake8: noqa' comment.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or untrusted data handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving untrusted sources; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '# flake8: noqa' to suppress style warnings; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with a linter suppression comment. No data processing, execution, or untrusted input handling is present. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities indicates benign intent. The suppression comment is a stylistic choice, not an indicator of malicious activity. The minimal code and lack of suspicious patterns justify very low malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The suppression comment does not introduce risk. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
