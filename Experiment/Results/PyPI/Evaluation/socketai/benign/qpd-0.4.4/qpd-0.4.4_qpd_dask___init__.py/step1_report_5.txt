{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes and functions from the qpd_dask.engine module, likely for data processing or SQL execution within a Dask environment.",
  "sources": "Import statement from qpd_dask.engine",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data processing or output functions are invoked",
  "flows": "No data flow is observed; only import statements are present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code contains an import statement with a 'noqa' comment to ignore linting issues. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two items from a module, suggesting that it is part of a larger application. The presence of 'noqa' indicates an attempt to suppress linter warnings, which might hide code quality issues but not malicious intent. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behaviors in this snippet. The module name and imported functions imply typical data processing functions, not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application setup for data analysis or SQL operations within a Dask framework. No malicious activity detected.",
