{
  "purpose": "Import modules QPDDaskEngine and run_sql_on_dask from qpd_dask.engine, likely for data processing or SQL execution on Dask.",
  "sources": "Imports from qpd_dask.engine, which could be used as sources for executing or handling data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any use of imported functions or classes where untrusted data might be processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/classes could be invoked with untrusted input, leading to data leaks or malicious execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code only imports modules; there are no calls, data handling, or other suspicious activities. The comment disables linter warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two specific components from a library named qpd_dask.engine. There is no evidence of data handling, user input, or execution of untrusted code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The import statements alone do not indicate malicious intent. The presence of the noqa comment suggests the author is suppressing linter warnings, possibly about unused imports or other stylistic issues, but does not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward import statement without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
