      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor concern about 'assert' does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the 'assert' statement's potential bypass. Overall, the package is safe and appropriate for use."

The scores assigned in the reports are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1–0.2) reflecting the internal module context but no actual threat."

No modifications are necessary; the code is safe and well-structured."
