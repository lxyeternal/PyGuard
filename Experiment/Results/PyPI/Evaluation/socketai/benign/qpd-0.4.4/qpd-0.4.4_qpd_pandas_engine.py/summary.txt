  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pandas-based SQL engine with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is minimal (around 0), primarily related to untrusted SQL input which is a common and accepted risk in such systems. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe and well-structured."
