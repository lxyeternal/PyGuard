{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the Delighted SDK, verifying API interactions, data handling, and response parsing without executing real network requests or handling sensitive data.",
  "sources": "Mock responses, function parameters, environment variables, test inputs such as emails, IDs, and date objects.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request formation (headers, URLs, payloads), object creation and attribute access, response handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into API request payloads and URLs; responses are processed into objects and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or malicious code patterns. Standard use of libraries and mocks.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard testing practices with mocks, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, and no malicious payloads. API keys are passed via parameters or mocks, not hardcoded. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input in a testing context, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard testing practices without real security threats.",
