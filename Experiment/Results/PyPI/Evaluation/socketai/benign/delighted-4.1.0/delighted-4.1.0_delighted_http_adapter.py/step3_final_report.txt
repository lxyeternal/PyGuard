  "purpose": "A simple HTTP client wrapper that performs requests and returns a custom response object.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the request method: method, uri, headers, data, params.",
  "sinks": "The requests.request call, which executes the HTTP request with provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into requests.request, and the response is wrapped into an HTTPResponse object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default argument 'headers={}', which can lead to unintended side-effects if headers are modified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward HTTP wrapper using the requests library, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code. It performs a direct request and wraps the response. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The only minor issue is the mutable default argument, which is a common Python anti-pattern but not security-critical. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard HTTP request wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The minor default argument issue does not impact security but could be improved for best practices. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malware risk.",
