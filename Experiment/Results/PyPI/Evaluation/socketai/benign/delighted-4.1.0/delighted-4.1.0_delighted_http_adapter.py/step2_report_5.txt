  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the original code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward HTTP wrapper using the requests library.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code structure is standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- The only minor concern noted is the use of mutable default arguments (`headers={}`), which can lead to unintended side effects but is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Issues present?** No. The analysis correctly states that the code is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. These seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Issues present?** No, but notes the mutable default argument (`headers={}`), which is a minor flaw.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. These are appropriate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct. No malicious activity, just a standard wrapper.\n- **Note:** The minor flaw (mutable default argument) is acknowledged but not critical.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, straightforward, benign.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Reasonable.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The risk score is uniformly 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern due to the use of mutable default arguments (a minor issue).\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor issue with mutable default argument; overall low risk.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- While the reports are accurate, I would emphasize that the mutable default argument (`headers={}`) is a best practice to fix, but it does not impact security directly.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here; the code is a standard HTTP client wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1 (minor coding practice issue) |\n\n**The code is benign, straightforward, and does not pose security risks or contain malware.**",
