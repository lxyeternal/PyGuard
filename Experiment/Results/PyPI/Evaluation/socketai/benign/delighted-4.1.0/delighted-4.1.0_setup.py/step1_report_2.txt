{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'delighted' by reading version info, dependencies, and metadata for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'delighted/__init__.py', reads 'README.md' for long description, and imports setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "Version info is extracted from the package's __init__.py, then used in setup. Data from README.md is read for description. No external data flows or inputs are processed during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code. The version extraction regex appears standard. No suspicious behavior or code obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup routine for a Python package, with safe file reads and standard package metadata. It handles ImportError gracefully, and reads version info via regex, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package. No malware, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
