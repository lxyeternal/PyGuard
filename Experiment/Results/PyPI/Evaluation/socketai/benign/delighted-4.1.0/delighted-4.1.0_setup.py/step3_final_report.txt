  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'delighted' Python library, reading version info, description, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'delighted/__init__.py', reads 'README.md' for long description, static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external data flows, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and regex extraction of version; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; regex for version extraction is standard; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, benign setup script performing static file reads and package configuration. It handles missing version info gracefully by raising an error. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. All signals indicate a safe, standard package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe Python package setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the code's behavior.",
