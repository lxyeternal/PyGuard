  "purpose": "This script is used to package and distribute a Python library named 'delighted'. It extracts version information from a source file and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'delighted/__init__.py' file to extract version; reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata and dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data sinks such as network, file write, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from source file, uses static metadata, and reads README content for description. No untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The version extraction assumes the presence of a version string; if absent, raises an error. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, attempting to import 'setuptools' with fallback, extracting version info from a source file via regex, and configuring package metadata including dependencies. The version extraction could raise an error if the version string is missing, but this is a standard safeguard. All dependencies and metadata are static and intended for package distribution. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code's structure is straightforward and conventional for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It safely extracts version info and configures package metadata. No security risks or malware are present.",
