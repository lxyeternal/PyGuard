{
  "purpose": "The code is used for setting up and packaging a Python library named 'delighted'.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from 'delighted/__init__.py', reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setup functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data directly; it primarily reads static files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Read version from the package init file -> use it in setup configuration; read README.md content -> pass to setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup routines: importing modules, reading version info from a file, and configuring package metadata. It handles ImportError for optional dependencies and reads static files for versioning and descriptions. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.",
