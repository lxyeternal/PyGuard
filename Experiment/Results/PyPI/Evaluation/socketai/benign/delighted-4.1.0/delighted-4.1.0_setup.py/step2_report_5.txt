  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are identified.\n- The version extraction via regex is standard practice.\n- No external data is processed dynamically or in an unsafe manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or code injection observed.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code reads static files ('delighted/__init__.py' and 'README.md') safely.\n- It handles ImportError gracefully.\n- The version string extraction assumes the presence of a proper `__version__` variable, which is standard.\n- The package dependencies are static and do not involve dynamic or untrusted input.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, justified by the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The regex for version extraction could raise an exception if the pattern isn't found, but this is a common safeguard, and the code raises a RuntimeError if version isn't found, which is appropriate.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are thorough and justified in their low scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** This code appears entirely benign and typical for Python package setup routines.",
