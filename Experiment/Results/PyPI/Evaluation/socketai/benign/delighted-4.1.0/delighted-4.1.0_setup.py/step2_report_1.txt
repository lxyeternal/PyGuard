  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing typical operations: importing modules, reading static files, extracting version info via regex, and configuring package metadata.  \n   **No issues or malicious behaviors are identified.** The code reads files, extracts version info, and sets up package parameters without executing untrusted code or performing any suspicious actions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the regex for version extraction is standard and that no malicious or obfuscated code is present.  \n   - The only minor point is that the regex assumes the version string exists; if it doesn't, it raises a RuntimeError, which is a typical safeguard.  \n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - Since the code is straightforward and safe, these scores are reasonable and should not be increased.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - No reason exists to assign a higher risk score. The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data handling that could introduce security risks.  \n   - The reports' scores are justified and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, network calls, or data exfiltration.  \n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All claims are based on the code's actual behavior; there are no unwarranted assumptions.  \n   - The regex for version extraction is standard, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are used.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no security issues. Therefore, I would assign:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
