  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Standard setup for a Python package, reading version info and README.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data or external data flows.\n- Anomalies: None detected; regex for version extraction is typical.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Completely standard, benign setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Same as above, standard package setup.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data, static reads.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns; regex is standard.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Typical, safe, with no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Standard extraction of version info, static metadata.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted or dynamic data processing.\n- Anomalies: Version extraction could raise an error if version string missing, but this is standard.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Conventional setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Same pattern—reading version, description, dependencies.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data or external flows.\n- Anomalies: Regex-based version extraction is common.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Typical, benign package setup.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Standard package configuration.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data or external data flows.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Legitimate setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risks:** No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, it should be **0**.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate.** There are no signs of supply chain compromise, malicious code, or security issues in this setup script.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
