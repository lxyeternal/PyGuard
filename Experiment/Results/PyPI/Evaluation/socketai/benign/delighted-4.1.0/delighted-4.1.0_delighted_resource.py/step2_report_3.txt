  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard resource classes; inputs are parameters and API responses.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests via `client.request_json`; URL encoding with `quote`.\n- **Flows:** Typical data flow; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Rate limit handling is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API client code; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar resource classes; data from parameters and API responses.\n- **Sinks:** API requests, URL encoding.\n- **Flows:** Standard; no dangerous data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Slightly unorthodox print statement in exception handling, but benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical API client; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable. The minor print statement does not elevate risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Resource classes with URL encoding of identifiers/emails.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, URL construction.\n- **Flows:** Data from parameters into URLs and requests.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `quote()` is standard; no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API client; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar resource classes; inputs from parameters.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, URL encoding.\n- **Flows:** Data flows into URL paths and request payloads.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard URL encoding; no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical API client; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Resource classes for API interaction.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, URL encoding.\n- **Flows:** Data from parameters into requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; standard patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. All scores reflect this.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns observed.\n- **Risk Scores:** Given the code's nature as an API client, the risk scores of 0.1 or 0.2 are reasonable. They reflect minimal security concern, primarily due to the use of untrusted inputs in URL construction, which is standard but warrants caution in production.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious intent, a risk score of 0.1 to 0.2 is justified. Slightly higher scores (like 0.3) could be considered if there were concerns about input validation, but current evidence does not support that.\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0               | 0                | 0.1        |\n| 2       | 0               | 0                | 0.2        |\n| 3       | 0               | 0                | 0.2        |\n| 4       | 0               | 0                | 0.2        |\n| 5       | 0               | 0                | 0.2        |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client library with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
