  "purpose": "A simple data container class for HTTP response components, storing status code, headers, body, and links.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters: status_code, headers, body, links (default empty dict)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations present",
  "flows": "Data assigned from constructor parameters to instance variables; no external data flow or processing",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default argument 'links={}', which can cause shared state issues but is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward data holder with no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The only concern is the mutable default argument, a known Python anti-pattern, but it does not introduce security risks. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external data leaks are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm benign intent. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate, reflecting a minor best practice issue rather than a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container with a minor Python best practice concern. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
