{
  "purpose": "Define a simple class to represent an HTTP response with status code, headers, body, and links.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: status_code, headers, body, links",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling beyond simple assignment; no network, file, or external data output",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned directly to instance variables without processing; no flow from source to sink indicating malicious intent",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default argument for 'links' can lead to shared state across instances, which is a minor design concern but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward data container with no complex logic or external interactions. The mutable default argument 'links={}' could potentially lead to unintended shared state between instances, but it does not suggest malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition serving as a data structure for HTTP responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
