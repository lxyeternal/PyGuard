  "purpose": "Define a simple HTTP response data structure for storing response details",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters: status_code, headers, body, links",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; class only stores data",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to class attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behavior; default mutable argument for links is a known issue but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward data container for HTTP response components. It assigns constructor arguments to instance attributes. There is no code execution, no external data fetching, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. The default mutable argument for 'links' could potentially lead to shared state issues, but it is a common Python pitfall rather than malicious behavior. Overall, the code is minimal, standard, and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic data structure with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious code. The only concern is the use of a mutable default argument, which is a best practice issue but not security-related.",
