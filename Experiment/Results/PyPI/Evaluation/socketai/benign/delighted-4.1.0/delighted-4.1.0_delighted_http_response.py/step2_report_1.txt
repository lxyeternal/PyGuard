  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same class, a simple data container for HTTP response components.\n- The primary concern across reports is the use of a mutable default argument (`links={}`), which is a common Python anti-pattern but not malicious.\n- No report indicates any code behavior that could be malicious, such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the conclusion that there's no malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1), reflecting minor best practice issues rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the class only stores data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The mutable default argument (`links={}`) is a known Python anti-pattern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the analysis; no changes needed.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal concern (mutable default argument), 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code does not perform any external operations or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code, with only a minor best practice concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a simple, non-malicious data container with a common Python anti-pattern. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
