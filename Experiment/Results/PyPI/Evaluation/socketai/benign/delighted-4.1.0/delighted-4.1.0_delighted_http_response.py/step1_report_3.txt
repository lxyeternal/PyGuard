{
  "purpose": "Define a simple HTTP response object with attributes for status code, headers, body, and links.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: status_code, headers, body, links",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process or execute data from sources in a dangerous way",
  "flows": "No complex data flow; attribute assignments from parameters to object properties",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default argument for links (default is an empty dict), which is generally discouraged but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for representing HTTP responses, with an __init__ constructor that assigns parameters to attributes. No data processing, external input handling, or execution occurs. The only minor concern is the mutable default argument for links, which can lead to unintended shared state, but this is not malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, code injections, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor coding concern is the mutable default argument, but it does not constitute malicious behavior or security threat.",
