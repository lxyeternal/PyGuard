{
  "purpose": "Define a simple HTTP response object with status code, headers, body, and links",
  "sources": "Input parameters in the constructor (__init__ method): status_code, headers, body, links",
  "sinks": "None; no processing or data output beyond object initialization",
  "flows": "Assignment of input parameters to object attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Default mutable argument 'links={}' which can lead to shared mutable state across instances",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an initializer assigning parameters to attributes. The use of a mutable default argument (links={}) is a known Python anti-pattern that can cause unexpected behavior but is not malicious. No external data sources, network operations, or unsafe code constructs are present. The class appears to be a simple data container without any malicious intent or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition intended for representing HTTP responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, aside from the minor best practice issue regarding mutable default arguments.",
