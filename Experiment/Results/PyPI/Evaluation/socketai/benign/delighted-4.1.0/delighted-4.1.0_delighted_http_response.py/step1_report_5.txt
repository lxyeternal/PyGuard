{
  "purpose": "Define a simple class representing an HTTP response with status code, headers, body, and links.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading occurs in this code; class initialization parameters are assigned to object attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets attributes during object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "The default mutable argument for 'links' (an empty dictionary) is a code smell but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic Python class with an __init__ method, assigning input parameters to object attributes. The default mutable argument for 'links' could lead to unintended shared state between instances, which is a common Python pitfall but not malicious. No external data processing, network operations, or suspicious code constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or contain suspicious behaviors. The only concern is the mutable default argument, which is a coding best practice issue rather than a security risk.",
