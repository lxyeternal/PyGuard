  "purpose": "Define module metadata, configure HTTP adapter, and manage shared client instance for interacting with the Delighted API.",
  "sources": "Import statements, global variables (api_key, api_base_url, shared_client), and the get_shared_client function.",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of the 'api_key' (though it's not assigned here), and creation of 'Client' instances which might handle sensitive data or API interactions.",
  "flows": "The 'get_shared_client' function creates or retrieves a singleton Client object, potentially used to communicate with the API endpoint at 'https://api.delightedapp.com/v1/'.",
  "anomalies": "The 'api_key' variable is declared but not initialized or used, which may indicate incomplete implementation or a placeholder for future secret management. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module metadata and initializes a client for the Delighted API via a singleton pattern. The import of 'HTTPAdapter' and 'Client' suggests external dependencies for API communication. The 'api_key' variable is present but uninitialized, indicating that secret management likely occurs elsewhere or is expected to be configured later. No user input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be standard setup code for an API client.\n\nOverall, this snippet shows standard dependency and client management with no malicious intent or security risks apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for a Python client library, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The uninitialized 'api_key' suggests that secret management is handled externally or in other parts of the application. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks are identified in this fragment.",
