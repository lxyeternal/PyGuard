  "purpose": "SDK setup and configuration for the delighted API client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (delighted.http_adapter, delighted.client, delighted.resource); declaration of api_key and shared_client variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from untrusted sources or written to external systems within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only initializes variables and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "The api_key variable is declared but remains uninitialized (None), indicating incomplete configuration; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK setup with metadata, module imports, and singleton pattern for shared client. No dynamic input, network activity, or malicious code present. The uninitialized api_key is typical for external configuration and does not pose a security risk here. External modules are imported but their contents are unknown; potential malicious behavior could originate there, but not from this snippet. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the risk score is low (0.1-0.2), justified by the incomplete configuration and reliance on external modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given the minimal concerns related to incomplete configuration. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
