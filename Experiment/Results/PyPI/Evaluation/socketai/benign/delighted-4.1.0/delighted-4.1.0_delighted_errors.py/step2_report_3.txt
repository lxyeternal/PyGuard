  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for handling various API error responses.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only noteworthy technical detail is the extraction of the 'Retry-After' header in `TooManyRequestsError`, which assumes the header's presence and correct format—this is standard in error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity is observed.\n\n**Assessment of the Security Aspects:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues are detected in the code itself.\n- **Malware or Malicious Behavior:** The code is purely for structured error handling, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risks:** Given the code's nature, the security risk is negligible. The only potential minor concern is the assumption that 'Retry-After' header exists and is an integer, but this is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- The consistent use of exception classes enhances error handling clarity but does not introduce any security concern.\n- The `__repr__` method formats response details; no sensitive data is exposed, assuming response bodies do not contain secrets.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a standard, safe implementation of API error handling classes with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The only technical note is the assumption about the 'Retry-After' header, which is typical and not problematic in this context.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with no security risks or malware. It serves its purpose effectively without introducing vulnerabilities.",
