  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leakage or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class is designed to represent specific API error scenarios, with some classes initializing additional attributes like 'retry_after'. The methods are straightforward, using string representations for debugging. There are no code injections, data leaks, or suspicious network or file operations. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be purely for error handling in an API client context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
