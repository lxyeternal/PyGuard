  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base `DelightedError`.\n- Each class encapsulates specific HTTP error responses, with some parsing headers like 'Retry-After'.\n- The implementation is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The `__repr__` method formats response details; the `TooManyRequestsError` extracts and converts a header value assuming it's always present and correctly formatted, which is standard for such error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or credentials:** None.\n- **Suspicious behavior or external communication:** None.\n- **Code purpose:** Structured API error handling, which is a common pattern.\n\n### Evaluation of Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The only minor assumption is in `TooManyRequestsError` where `response.headers['Retry-After']` is converted to int without error handling. While this could be risky if the header is missing or malformed, in typical API client code, this is a standard assumption, especially if the server is well-behaved. This does not constitute malicious behavior but is a potential robustness concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is purely for structured exception handling.**\n- **No signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent.**\n- **The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, due to header assumption robustness, but not a security risk per se)\n\n**Overall, I concur with the existing scores.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom API error exceptions with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current assessment is accurate; the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and a negligible security risk.",
