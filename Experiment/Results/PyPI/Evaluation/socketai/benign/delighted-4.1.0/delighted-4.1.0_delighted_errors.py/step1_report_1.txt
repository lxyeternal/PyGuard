{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various API error responses related to a service, likely for structured error management in an application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read, all data is handled via exception objects instantiated during runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; error information is stored within exception objects and not processed further in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines exception classes without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code contains straightforward exception class definitions with standard attributes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, DelightedError. Each class encapsulates different HTTP error responses, with some parsing specific headers such as 'Retry-After'. There is no evidence of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The design appears to be for structured API error handling. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful within its context.",
