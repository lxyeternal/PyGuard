  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks is found.\n- The only notable implementation detail is the extraction of 'Retry-After' header in `TooManyRequestsError`, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description; it defines exception classes with no external data processing or dynamic code.\n- The `__repr__` method in `DelightedError` formats response status and body, which is standard.\n- The `TooManyRequestsError` extracts `'Retry-After'` header and converts it to int; assuming the header exists and is correctly formatted, this is typical.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors are apparent.\n- The assumption that `'Retry-After'` header is always present could be a minor concern; if absent, it would raise a KeyError. However, this is a common pattern, and such errors would be handled elsewhere in actual usage.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The `risk` score is 0 in all cases, which seems appropriate given the absence of security issues.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is purely for error handling, with no security implications.\n\n**5. Malware score:**\n- Confirmed as 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n\n**6. Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The only potential assumption is the presence of `'Retry-After'` header, but this is standard HTTP behavior and not an indication of vulnerability.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical, safe implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling.\n- No supply chain or security concerns are evident.\n- The detailed analysis supports the conclusion that the code is safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**This aligns with the detailed analysis and the content of all reports.**",
