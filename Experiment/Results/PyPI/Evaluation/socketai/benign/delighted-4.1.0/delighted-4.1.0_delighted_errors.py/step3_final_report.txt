{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses, encapsulating HTTP status codes and response details.",
  "sources": "Response object attributes such as response.status_code, response.body, response.headers['Retry-After']",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or produce outputs that could leak data",
  "flows": "Response object attributes are accessed directly; no complex data flows or untrusted data processing occur",
  "anomalies": "Assumption that 'Retry-After' header always exists and is an integer; no error handling for missing or malformed headers",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward custom exception classes inheriting from a base, designed for API error handling. It formats response details in __repr__, and in TooManyRequestsError, extracts 'Retry-After' header assuming its presence and correct format. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is static, well-structured, and aligns with standard practices. The only minor concern is robustness regarding header presence, but this does not constitute malicious behavior or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of API error exception classes with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
