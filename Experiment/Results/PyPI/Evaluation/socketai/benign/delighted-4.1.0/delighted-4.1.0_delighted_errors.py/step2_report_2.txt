  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling API error responses.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, sinks, or complex data flows.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The only minor technical note is that `TooManyRequestsError` assumes the 'Retry-After' header is always present and correctly formatted, but this is typical in such error handling code.\n\n**Security and Malware Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature—pure class definitions without any dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data processing beyond storing response objects, or execute any untrusted input.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is justified; this is a standard error handling pattern with no security concerns.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only point worth noting is the assumption that `'Retry-After'` header exists and is an integer. If the header is missing or malformed, it could raise an exception. However, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious or dangerous—it's more about robustness.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom API error exception classes. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
