  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses in a structured way.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; all data are from exception responses provided during instantiation.",
  "targets": "No potential data leaks or untrusted data handling that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The code straightforwardly defines exception classes with custom __repr__ and __str__ methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base DelightedError. These classes encapsulate API error responses, including response objects with status codes, headers, and bodies. The only potentially noteworthy part is the __repr__ method which formats response details. The __init__ method in TooManyRequestsError extracts a 'Retry-After' header and converts it to an integer, which assumes the header is always present and correctly formatted, but this is standard practice for such error handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. The code performs simple data encapsulation with no external dependencies or dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for API error handling with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard, straightforward implementation for structured error reporting.",
