  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API error responses.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading functions present).",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks, output, or external communication).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; the code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, each representing specific HTTP error responses for an API client. The classes primarily store response objects and some extract headers (e.g., 'Retry-After') for rate-limiting. The implementation appears standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or external communications. Overall, the code appears to be a typical error handling module for API responses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions for API error handling, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears well-structured and secure, with no evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior.",
