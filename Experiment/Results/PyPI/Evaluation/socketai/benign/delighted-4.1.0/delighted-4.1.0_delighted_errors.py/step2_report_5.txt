  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for handling API errors.\n- No external data, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are identified.\n- The only technical detail worth noting is the extraction of the 'Retry-After' header in `TooManyRequestsError`, which assumes the header's presence and correct format. This is typical in such error handling and not inherently suspicious.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Security risk:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The risk score should remain low (e.g., 0) because the code is purely for error handling, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The malware score should stay at 0; there's no malware or malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Potential points of concern:**\n- The assumption that `'Retry-After'` header always exists and is correctly formatted could lead to runtime errors if not validated elsewhere, but this does not elevate the security risk or malware score. It's a standard practice in error handling, assuming upstream validation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Based on the detailed analysis, the current scores are appropriate.\n- I would maintain the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the purpose of the code.",
