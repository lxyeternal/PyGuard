  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific API error responses.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines classes without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to common exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, DelightedError. Each class is tailored to handle specific HTTP error statuses related to an API, with constructors storing response objects and, in one case, extracting a 'Retry-After' header. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. The classes are standard and do not include any dangerous or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured, non-malicious exception classes for API error handling. There are no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
