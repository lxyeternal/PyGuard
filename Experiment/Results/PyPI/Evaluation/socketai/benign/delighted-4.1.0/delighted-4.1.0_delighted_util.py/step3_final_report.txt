  "purpose": "Convert datetime objects (aware and naive) into epoch timestamps and serialize nested data structures into key-value pairs for data transmission or storage.",
  "sources": "Datetime objects (both aware and naive), nested dictionaries, lists, and tuples within the input data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; data is serialized into key-value pairs within the program's context.",
  "flows": "Datetime objects are processed through _encode_datetime() and aware_datetime_to_epoch_seconds(), then serialized via encode() into key-value pairs, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of time.mktime() assumes local timezone but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries to handle timezone-aware and naive datetime objects, converting them into epoch seconds. It serializes nested data structures into key-value pairs, suitable for data transmission. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising logic is present. The functions are straightforward, correctly implemented, and rely on common patterns. No external network or system commands are used. The security implications are minimal, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for datetime encoding and data serialization, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
