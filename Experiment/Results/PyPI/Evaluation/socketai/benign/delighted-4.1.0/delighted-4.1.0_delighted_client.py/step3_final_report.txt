  "purpose": "A standard API client for interacting with the Delighted API, handling authentication, request formation, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "API key input, parameters for request, response body from HTTP adapter",
  "sinks": "Authorization header (API key), JSON response parsing, exception raising based on status codes",
  "flows": "API key from input -> encoded in headers -> request sent -> response received -> JSON parsed or exception raised",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no external malicious calls",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an API client, utilizing standard libraries and practices. API key handling is secure, with encoding for Basic Auth. Request construction differentiates GET requests from others, and response handling maps status codes to exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and conventional, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. No modifications or warnings are necessary.",
