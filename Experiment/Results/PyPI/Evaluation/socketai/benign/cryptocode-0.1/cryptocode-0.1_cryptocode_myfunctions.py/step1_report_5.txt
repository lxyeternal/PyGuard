{
  "purpose": "The code implements AES-GCM encryption and decryption using a password-derived key for secure message confidentiality.",
  "sources": "User provides the 'message' and 'password' inputs for encryption; during decryption, the encrypted string is input for decryption.",
  "sinks": "Decrypted message output; the encrypted string returned by the encrypt function.",
  "flows": "User inputs 'message' and 'password' → key derivation with scrypt → encryption with AES-GCM → output encrypted string; for decryption: encrypted string split → key derivation → decryption with AES-GCM → output decrypted message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs; standard cryptographic practices are used. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. No suspicious network activity or data leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard cryptographic libraries (Cryptodome) for secure encryption/decryption with proper key derivation (scrypt) and AES-GCM mode. Inputs are taken as parameters, processed securely, and outputs are base64-encoded. Error handling is minimal but typical for such functions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. All operations follow expected cryptographic procedures without unsafe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, correctly implemented encryption/decryption utility with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The design is consistent with secure data handling, with no obvious security risks or malicious signals.",
