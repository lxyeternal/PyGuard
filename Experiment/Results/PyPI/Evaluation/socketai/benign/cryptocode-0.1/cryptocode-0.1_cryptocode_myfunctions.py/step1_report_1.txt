{
  "purpose": "Provides symmetric encryption and decryption functions using AES-GCM with password-derived keys.",
  "sources": "Input message (plaintext), password, encrypted string, and split components during decryption.",
  "sinks": "Decryption process involves cryptographic operations; no external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Password input is used to derive keys; message encryption produces a concatenated string; decryption splits and processes this string to recover plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; cryptographic best practices followed; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation; exception handling is broad but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic procedures for encrypting and decrypting messages using AES-GCM with keys derived via scrypt. It generates salts and nonces securely, encodes data with base64, and manages encryption/decryption flows correctly. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The broad exception handling may mask errors but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate cryptographic functions for encrypting and decrypting messages using password-based key derivation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a standard, well-structured encryption utility without security risks or malicious intent.",
