{
  "purpose": "Provides password-based symmetric encryption and decryption using AES-GCM with key derivation via scrypt, ensuring secure data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input message in 'encrypt'; reads encrypted string in 'decrypt'; uses get_random_bytes for salt and nonce generation.",
  "sinks": "Returns encrypted string in 'encrypt'; returns decrypted plaintext or False in 'decrypt'. No external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "encrypt() derives key from password and salt, encrypts message, outputs concatenated base64-encoded components; decrypt() splits input, decodes, derives key, decrypts, and verifies.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling in 'decrypt' masks errors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic practices with AES-GCM and scrypt, correctly generating salts and nonces, encoding data, and handling errors. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The broad exception handling could obscure errors but does not indicate malicious intent. The cryptographic approach aligns with best practices, and the absence of suspicious data flows or network activity confirms benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard implementation of password-based encryption/decryption. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, with the minor concern being broad exception handling which could be refined but does not compromise security.",
