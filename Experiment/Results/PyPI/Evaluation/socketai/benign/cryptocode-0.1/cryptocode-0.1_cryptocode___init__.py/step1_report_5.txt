  "purpose": "Importing encryption and decryption functions from a local module named 'myfunctions'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'myfunctions' when importing 'encrypt' and 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected in this import statement. It appears to be a standard local import of cryptographic functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module, which could contain any logic, including cryptography functions. However, on its own, this import statement is benign. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious code is present. Without examining 'myfunctions', no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports cryptographic functions, which is typical in security-focused code. No malicious behavior or supply chain issues are evident here.",
