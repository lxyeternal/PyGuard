  "purpose": "Import encryption and decryption functions from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.myfunctions'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data output or network operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed beyond importing functions from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions, encrypt and decrypt, from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activity within this fragment. As it is only an import statement, it cannot be evaluated for malicious intent without additional context or usage. The code appears straightforward and typical for cryptographic functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger codebase that performs encryption and decryption tasks. No immediate concerns based on this fragment alone.",
