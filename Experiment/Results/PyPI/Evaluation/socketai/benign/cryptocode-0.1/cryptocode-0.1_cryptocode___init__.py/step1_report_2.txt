  "purpose": "Importing encryption and decryption functions from a local module, likely for cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module '.myfunctions' to import 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling shown; this is just an import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow since only an import statement is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the use of local module imports for cryptographic functions could be benign or part of malicious obfuscation if the functions themselves are malicious. No actual implementation or usage shown here.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a simple import statement from a relative module. It suggests that cryptographic functions are being imported, but without further code, it is impossible to determine their use or malicious intent. No suspicious behavior or anomalies are evident in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be setting up cryptographic functions, which could be for legitimate purposes. Further context is needed to assess risk.",
