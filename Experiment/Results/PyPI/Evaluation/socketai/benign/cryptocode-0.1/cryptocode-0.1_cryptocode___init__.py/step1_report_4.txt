  "purpose": "Import encryption and decryption functions from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.myfunctions'",
  "sinks": "None present in this snippet; no data sinks or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow visible; only module import",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import suggests modular code; no anomalies detected in this fragment",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two functions, 'encrypt' and 'decrypt', from a local module. This indicates that encryption functionalities are used, but no actual logic, data handling, or execution flow is present here. Since it is a minimal import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. No external communication or sensitive data handling is shown. The presence of encryption functions alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for encryption functions from a local module. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flow, and no security risks evident from this snippet.",
