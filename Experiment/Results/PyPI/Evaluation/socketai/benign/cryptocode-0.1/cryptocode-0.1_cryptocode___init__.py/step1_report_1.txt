{
  "purpose": "The code imports two functions, encrypt and decrypt, from a local module named myfunctions. Its purpose appears to be related to data encryption and decryption.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module .myfunctions to import functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present within this snippet; it only imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two functions from a relative module. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no untrusted data sources or sinks. It is a simple import statement, which is common in modular code. Without additional context or implementation details of the imported functions, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious operations and appears benign.",
