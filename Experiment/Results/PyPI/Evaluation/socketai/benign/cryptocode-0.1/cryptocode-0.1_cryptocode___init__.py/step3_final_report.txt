  "purpose": "Import cryptographic functions 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' from a local module 'myfunctions'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports functions without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which is typical for modular cryptographic operations. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are evident. The functions' implementation is unknown, so potential risks depend on their content, but the import itself is benign. Confidence in benign nature is high due to code simplicity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk associated with cryptographic functions. Further review of 'myfunctions' implementation is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
