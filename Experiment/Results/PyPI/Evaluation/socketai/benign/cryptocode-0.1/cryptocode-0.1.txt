The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk associated with cryptographic functions. Further review of 'myfunctions' implementation is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard implementation of password-based encryption/decryption. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, with the minor concern being broad exception handling which could be refined but does not compromise security."
