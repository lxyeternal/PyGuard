{
  "purpose": "To define and configure a Python package named 'cryptocode' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and setup instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static configuration data within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or user input; no runtime data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; configuration is static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata including package name, version, license, description, author, URL, keywords, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic evaluations, no input handling, nor any network or system calls. The code appears to be a typical, benign package setup configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and typical for open-source distribution. No malware, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
