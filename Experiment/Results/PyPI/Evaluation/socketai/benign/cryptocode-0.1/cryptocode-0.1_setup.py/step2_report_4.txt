  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package named 'cryptocode'.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or network activity is involved.\n- The dependency 'pycryptodomex' is common for cryptography and not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The scripts are consistent with typical package configuration practices.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description perfectly; it is a straightforward setup script.\n   - No issues or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1), which is reasonable given the context.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation.\n   - The high confidence scores (1) are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is benign, there is no justification for higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - Correctly set to 0 across all reports, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on code inspection.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis provided.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup.py script.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard package setup risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThis package setup script appears entirely safe, with no indications of supply chain security issues. The dependency on 'pycryptodomex' is standard for cryptography libraries and does not raise concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0               |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1             |\n\nAll evidence supports that this is a legitimate, benign package setup script with no security concerns.",
