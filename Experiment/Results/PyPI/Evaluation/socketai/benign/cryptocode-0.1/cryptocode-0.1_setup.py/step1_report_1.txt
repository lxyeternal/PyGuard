{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'cryptocode', including metadata and dependencies, for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description; static strings defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "targets": "None explicitly; the script does not process untrusted input or output data to external sources.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard setup procedures with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical setup process for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README.md file to include as the long description and sets package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no input/output flows involving untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs observed. It only deals with package configuration, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves solely to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
