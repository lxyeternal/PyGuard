{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'cryptocode' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, and package metadata defined within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions that could leak data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> setup configuration -> package installation dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' to configure a Python package, reads the long description from 'README.md', and specifies dependencies, classifiers, and package metadata. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The dependency on 'pycryptodomex' is common for cryptography-related packages and does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears straightforward and adheres typical package configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
