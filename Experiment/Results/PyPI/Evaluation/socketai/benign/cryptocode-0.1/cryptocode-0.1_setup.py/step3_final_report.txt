  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python cryptography library named 'cryptocode'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; uses setuptools.find_packages() for package discovery; specifies dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network calls, or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description; passes static metadata and dependencies to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, benign package setup configuration. It performs straightforward file reading and package metadata declaration without any dynamic or malicious code. All reports correctly identify it as a safe, standard setup script with no security issues. Malware scores are consistently 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are minimal (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are present or inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores provided are accurate and appropriate.",
