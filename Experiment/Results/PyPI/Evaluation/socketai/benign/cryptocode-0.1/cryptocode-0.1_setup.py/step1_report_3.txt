{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'cryptocode' that provides encryption and decryption functionalities for strings.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata defined in setup() arguments; importing 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly takes or processes untrusted input at runtime; all data is static or file-based during setup.",
  "flows": "N/A - setup configuration does not involve data flows from sources to sinks in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code strictly follows standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for Python packaging. It reads a markdown file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input handling, dynamic code execution, or external data processing occurs here. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The only dependency listed is 'pycryptodomex', which is a standard cryptography library. Overall, this is a benign package setup script without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a cryptography library. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use.",
