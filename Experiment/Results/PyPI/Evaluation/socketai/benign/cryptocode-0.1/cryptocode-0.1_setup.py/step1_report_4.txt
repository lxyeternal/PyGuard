{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'cryptocode' that provides encryption and decryption functionalities, including reading a README file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description; importing 'setuptools'; accessing package metadata (name, version, license, description, author, url, keywords, install_requires, classifiers).",
  "targets": "No evident direct untrusted data input or output; the setup script primarily prepares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading file 'README.md' -> storing content in 'long_description' -> passing parameters to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears standard for a setup.py script; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a README file, then uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or execute untrusted code. Usage of 'pycryptodomex' as a dependency is common for cryptographic functions, not inherently malicious. No unusual variables, code obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely to configure package installation parameters without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and standard for a Python package setup script.",
