  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly states that the code is solely about importing modules with fallback mechanisms. No dynamic code execution, data flow from untrusted sources, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign. No issues identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, the code performs conditional imports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis is correct; no anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns, just compatibility handling.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, only import statements with fallback logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Suitable.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code remains a benign import setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis correctly notes no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—imports with fallback.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found; the reasoning aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign import setup with no malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are consistent and reasonable.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe import pattern for a testing utility library. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action needed. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
