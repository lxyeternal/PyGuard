  "purpose": "A utility to run Python tests with filtering, coverage, and report generation, managing environment setup and report post-processing.",
  "sources": "Command line arguments, environment variables, filesystem (for cleanup and report files), imported modules.",
  "sinks": "File operations (deleting/creating files), directory changes, invoking nose.run() for test execution, report file modifications.",
  "flows": "User inputs influence test execution parameters, report cleanup, and modification steps; environment variables affect coverage file location.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, network activity, or malicious payloads detected. Commented-out code suggests incomplete features but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code manages test execution workflows, including argument parsing, environment cleanup, and report post-processing. It uses standard modules and practices. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration are present. Files are cleaned before tests and reports are modified after, typical for test harnesses. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard testing utility for Python projects, with no malicious or supply chain threats detected. The scores and assessments across reports are accurate and justified.",
