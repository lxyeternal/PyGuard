  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard import statement, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment header and an import statement importing three items from a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No input sources or output sinks are present, and no data flow or obfuscation is apparent. This appears to be a typical module import used to access functionalities in the pyutilib package.",
