  "purpose": "Manage plugin registration and querying for external executables via extension points, ensuring that executables are registered only once and can be retrieved or invoked as needed.",
  "sources": "ExtensionPoint extensions(), ep.service(name), ep(name, all=True), find_executable() on registered extensions, environment modifications via PluginGlobals.add_env() and pop_env().",
  "sinks": "Invocation of find_executable() which may call external system commands, environment modifications during registration.",
  "flows": "registered_executable() retrieves extensions; register_executable() adds new executable and calls find_executable() on existing ones; environment context is managed during registration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The call to find_executable() could invoke external commands, but this is standard behavior in plugin systems.",
  "analysis": "The code manages plugin registration and querying through extension points, with environment context management. It uses find_executable() to locate system binaries, which could potentially invoke external commands. No malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions perform standard plugin management tasks, and the only potential risk stems from external command invocation, which is typical in such systems but should be monitored if plugins are untrusted. The overall structure is straightforward, and the code aligns with common plugin architecture patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of find_executable() introduces a minimal risk associated with external command invocation, but this is expected in plugin systems and does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are appropriate and justified based on static analysis.",
