  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of find_executable() introduces a minimal risk associated with external command invocation, but this is expected in plugin systems and does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are appropriate and justified based on static analysis."
