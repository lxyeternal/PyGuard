{
  "purpose": "Define a nose plugin to force garbage collection before and after each test to ensure memory cleanup during testing.",
  "sources": "Importing 'collect' from gc module, class definition, and method calls within beforeTest and afterTest.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only invokes garbage collection, which is a benign operation.",
  "flows": "Import gc.collect() -> called in beforeTest and afterTest methods, with no external data inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded strings, or unusual code constructs present. The plugin performs straightforward memory cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard 'gc' module and the base Plugin class from 'nose.plugins.base'. It defines a class 'ForcedGC' with a specified name and score for plugin loading order. The methods 'beforeTest' and 'afterTest' invoke 'collect()' to trigger garbage collection, which is standard for ensuring memory is freed between tests. No external inputs, credentials, or data manipulation are present. The code appears to be a simple testing utility with no malicious or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign nose plugin designed for memory management during testing. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply calls garbage collection routines before and after tests, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
