  "purpose": "This module defines a nose plugin to forceably run the Python garbage collector before and after each test, to ensure clean test environments.",
  "sources": "Import of 'collect' from 'gc' module, usage of 'nose.plugins.base.Plugin' class, and 'beforeTest' and 'afterTest' methods",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, external network, or sensitive data processing present",
  "flows": "The plugin lifecycle methods call 'collect()' before and after tests, with no external data flow or manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation for test environment management",
  "analysis": "The code imports the garbage collector function and the Plugin base class, then defines a plugin class that calls 'collect()' before and after each test. The plugin is intended to ensure memory cleanup during testing. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code functions solely to manage test environment state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test utility plugin with no malicious or security risk behavior. It simply manages garbage collection around tests, which is standard practice in testing environments.",
