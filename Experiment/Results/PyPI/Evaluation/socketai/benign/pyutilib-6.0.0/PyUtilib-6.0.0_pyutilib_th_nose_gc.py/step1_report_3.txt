  "purpose": "This module defines a nose plugin to forcefully run the Python garbage collector before and after each test to ensure memory cleanup during testing.",
  "sources": "import statements for gc.collect and nose.plugins.base.Plugin",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code calls a safe standard library function (gc.collect) at specific hooks without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The plugin simply invokes standard garbage collection functions at test hooks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the garbage collector's collect function and a base plugin class. It defines a plugin class that calls collect() before and after each test. The plugin is designed to help manage memory during testing. No external input handling or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to safe coding practices. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test utility plugin aimed at memory management during testing. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
