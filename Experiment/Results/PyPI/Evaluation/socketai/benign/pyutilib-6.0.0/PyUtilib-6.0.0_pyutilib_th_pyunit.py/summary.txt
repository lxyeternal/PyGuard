  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured testing utility framework with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The minor risks associated with subprocess commands and dynamic imports are typical in testing environments and do not indicate malicious intent. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) are justified and appropriate."
