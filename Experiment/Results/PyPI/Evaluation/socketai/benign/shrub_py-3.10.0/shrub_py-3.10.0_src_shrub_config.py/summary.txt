  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration utility with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to handling user input with validation. The existing reports' assessments are consistent; however, the high risk score in Report 1 (0.9) should be lowered to reflect the benign nature of the code."
