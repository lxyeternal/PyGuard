  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, safe utility library for generating Evergreen CI/CD commands. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The validation and parameter handling are appropriate, and the overall security risk is low. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and implementation."
