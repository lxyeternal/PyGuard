{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for constructing and managing task configurations in a build system, including task dependencies, groups, and commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as task names, command definitions, function names, variable maps, and configuration options like activate flags and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially harmful manner, such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Input sources like task names, commands, and function names are stored in class attributes and used internally to build data structures; no direct flow from untrusted sources to security-sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class and method definitions without unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file operations are evident. The code appears to be purely configuration data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of classes for defining tasks, dependencies, and task groups in a build system, with parameter validation and structured data output via _yaml_map(). No input parsing or external data handling is present that could be exploited. It primarily constructs data objects for configuration purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a well-structured configuration framework for task management in a build system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks. It functions as a safe data modeling layer without any evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
