{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for creating and managing tasks, task dependencies, and task groups within an Evergreen CI/CD pipeline configuration.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from function parameters such as task names, command definitions, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow points include adding commands, dependencies, and configuration options; however, there are no direct sinks that handle untrusted external data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes and methods that build task configurations; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with validation checks. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to define tasks and dependencies with proper type checks and clear method functionalities. No external input is handled insecurely; all inputs are validated before use. No suspicious or malicious operations, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The design appears to be for configuration purposes within a CI/CD context, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class implementation for CI/CD pipelines, with proper input validation and no signs of malicious behavior. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
