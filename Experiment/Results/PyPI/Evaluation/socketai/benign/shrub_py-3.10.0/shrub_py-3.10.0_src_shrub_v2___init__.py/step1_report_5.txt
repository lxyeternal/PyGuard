  "purpose": "Import statements for the shrub.v2 library modules related to project management, variants, commands, and tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no code execution or data handling occurs within these import statements",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling evident in the provided code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected in the import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the shrub.v2 package, which is typically used for project automation and management. These are standard imports and do not execute any logic or handle external data. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present. The absence of function calls or data processing reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior. The code appears to be the initial setup for further scripting or automation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of import statements for a project management library and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and typical for Python projects utilizing external modules.",
