  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static imports without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from the 'shrub.v2' package, involving modules related to project, variant, command, and task management. There are no executable statements, data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is typical for build setup scripts and contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the static import statements. No further action or concern is necessary.",
