  "purpose": "Utility functions for conditionally adding entries to dictionaries based on value existence.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'obj', 'key_value', and 'values' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary modifications via 'obj[key_name] = key_value'. No untrusted data output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into dictionary updates; no external data or user input flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Functions perform straightforward conditional additions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions to add key-value pairs to dictionaries only if the value exists and is not empty. No external data reading, network operations, or system commands are present. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. The logic is clear and standard. There are no suspicious patterns or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing basic dictionary utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
