  "sources": "Function parameters: obj, key_name, key_value, values; internal checks for None and list length.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary updates within add_if_exists and add_existing_from_dict functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> checks for None or empty -> conditional dictionary insertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward logic, no obfuscation, no external data access or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, safe dictionary updates with checks to prevent adding None or empty lists. No dynamic code execution, external data access, or obfuscation is present. The logic is correct and standard for utility functions. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The confidence score of 1 is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
