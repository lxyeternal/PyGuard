  "sources": "Input parameters: 'obj', 'key_value', 'values' dictionary entries.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to the 'obj' dictionary; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input data (key_value, values) flows into add_if_exists, which updates 'obj' if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No external network or system interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward utility functions to add key-value pairs to dictionaries if the value exists and is not empty. The functions perform checks on 'key_value' before insertion, ensuring no None or empty list values are added. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and appears purely functional with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for dictionary manipulation with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
