  "purpose": "Utility functions for conditionally adding key-value pairs to dictionaries based on value existence and content.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: 'obj' (a dictionary to modify) and 'values' (a dictionary of key-value pairs).",
  "sinks": "Modifications are made directly to the 'obj' dictionary, which can be used later in the codebase.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'values' and 'key_value' parameters into 'obj' via add_if_exists and add_existing_from_dict functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network or system interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions that add entries to a dictionary only if the value is not None and, in the case of lists, not empty. It performs straightforward checks and updates without any external I/O, network access, or system modification. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious logic. The functions serve as helper utilities and do not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing standard dictionary update logic with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
