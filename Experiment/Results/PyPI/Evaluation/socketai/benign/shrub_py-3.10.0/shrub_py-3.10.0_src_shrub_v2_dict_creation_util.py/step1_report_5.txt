  "purpose": "Utility functions for conditionally adding key-value pairs to dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters: 'obj' (dictionary to modify) and 'values' (dictionary of key-value pairs to add).",
  "targets": "The dictionary 'obj' that is being updated with new key-value pairs based on conditions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameters 'values' and 'key_value' into the 'obj' dictionary via 'add_if_exists' and 'add_existing_from_dict' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. Functions perform straightforward conditional dictionary updates without external network interactions or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions that conditionally add key-value pairs to a dictionary. 'add_if_exists' adds a key-value pair only if the value is not None and not an empty list. 'add_existing_from_dict' iterates over a provided dictionary of values, adding each to the target dictionary if valid. The logic is simple, safe, and does not involve external I/O, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. No malicious intent or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for dictionary manipulation with no malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues identified.",
