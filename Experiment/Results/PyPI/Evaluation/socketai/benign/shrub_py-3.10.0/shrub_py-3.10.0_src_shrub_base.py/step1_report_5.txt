{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'EvergreenBuilder' for converting objects to YAML and JSON formats with customizable attribute handling.",
  "sources": "The class reads data from object attributes via getattr(self, prop) and class methods. It also uses the yaml and json modules for serialization.",
  "sinks": "The code calls yaml.dump() and json.dumps() which serialize the object's data. No untrusted data sources or malicious data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Attributes are fetched and conditionally processed; data is then serialized into YAML or JSON formats. No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code structure is typical for serialization tasks, with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for converting objects to dictionary, YAML, and JSON formats. It uses standard library modules and well-structured attribute handling. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or other malicious activities are evident. The class methods perform standard serialization with no malicious side effects. Usage of collections.abc.Sequence and recursive calls within _add_if_defined is typical for nested data handling. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation of an abstract serialization base class with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any malicious operations or data leaks.",
