{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for converting objects to YAML and JSON formats with customizable mappings.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes via getattr and uses internal methods to process and serialize data.",
  "sinks": "Serialization functions (yaml.dump and json.dumps) output data, but do not involve untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Input attributes are processed internally and then serialized; no external untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data theft, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured approach to object serialization with flexible mapping. It relies on class-defined attributes and optional recursion, but it does not include any external input handling, network activity, or code execution. The code appears to be a benign utility class for configuration management. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. There are no obfuscation techniques or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard serialization utility class with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, and it is safe for use.",
