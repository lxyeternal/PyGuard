{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract base class for building objects that can be converted to YAML and JSON configurations, primarily for serialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class attributes via getattr(self, prop) within the _add_if_defined method.",
  "sinks": "The sinks are the yaml.dump and json.dumps functions, which serialize data into YAML and JSON formats respectively. No untrusted data flows are explicitly evident, but the dumps could be risky if data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through _add_if_defined to the internal dictionary obj, which is then serialized via yaml.dump or json.dumps.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard serialization class with no malicious patterns or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The class uses standard Python modules and abc for abstract classes. The methods involve converting objects to maps, and then to YAML or JSON strings. The only input data are the class attributes, which are processed based on their presence and type. There are no external data sources, network operations, or code execution. The structure is straightforward, focusing on data serialization without any suspicious logic or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be a benign serialization utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard serialization utility class with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply transforms class attributes into YAML and JSON formats. No anomalies, malware, or security issues are detected.",
