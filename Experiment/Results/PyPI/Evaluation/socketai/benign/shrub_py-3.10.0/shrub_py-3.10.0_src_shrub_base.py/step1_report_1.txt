{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for converting objects to YAML and JSON formats with customizable attribute mappings.",
  "sources": "Imports (abc, collections, json, yaml), class methods accessing self attributes, and the to_map, to_yaml, to_json functions.",
  "sinks": "json.dumps and yaml.dump convert internal data structures into strings, which is standard serialization; no untrusted data handling or external network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Object attributes are read in _add_if_defined; these are processed and passed into dump functions. No external or untrusted sources are directly involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward serialization utility with no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. Usage of collections.abc.Sequence is standard, and no dangerous code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for converting objects to map/dictionary representations and then serializing to YAML and JSON. It employs attribute checking and recursive conversion where needed. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The structure is standard for serialization purposes, and no anomalies like hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign serialization utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It correctly converts class attributes to YAML and JSON formats, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
