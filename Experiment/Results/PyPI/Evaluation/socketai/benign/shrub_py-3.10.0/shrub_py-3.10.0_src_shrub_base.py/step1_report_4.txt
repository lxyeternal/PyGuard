  "purpose": "Define an abstract class for converting objects to YAML and JSON formats with optional recursive mapping of attributes.",
  "sources": "None; the code reads class attributes and calls external yaml and json libraries.",
  "sinks": "Calls to yaml.dump() and json.dumps() for serialization.",
  "flows": "Attributes are gathered and possibly converted to maps, then serialized to YAML or JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or external network access. The use of external libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a framework for converting class instances to YAML and JSON, including optional recursive processing of nested objects. It relies on the _yaml_map() method to determine attribute mappings and recursion logic. The code does not contain any suspicious logic such as data exfiltration, hidden network calls, or malicious behavior. It performs straightforward data serialization. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. External library usage (yaml and json) is standard and safe. Overall, this appears to be benign code implementing serialization functionality with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an abstract class for object serialization to YAML and JSON, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
