  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on code review.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, module imports, code functions, input/output points, network connections, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, data leaks, execution points (eval/exec).",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into code logic, possibly reaching sinks like network or file system, but no suspicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Multiple reports indicate thorough review with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. Scores consistently reflect benign assessments: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk around 0.2. Confidence levels are high to moderate, justified by the absence of suspicious code or behaviors. No anomalies or malicious indicators found. The code is minimal or absent in some reports, with appropriate low risk scores. Overall, the evidence supports a benign security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The dependency can be considered safe based on current evidence.",
