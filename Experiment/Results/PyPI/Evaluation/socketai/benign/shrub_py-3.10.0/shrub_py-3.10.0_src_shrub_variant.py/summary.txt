  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration data model for an Evergreen CI system, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
