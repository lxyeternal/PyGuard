  "purpose": "Configuration classes for defining build variants, tasks, display tasks, and related components in an Evergreen CI system.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and setter methods that assign values to internal attributes; no external data input or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Internal data storage and serialization via _yaml_map methods; no external output, network communication, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters and method inputs into class attributes, then into serialization structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; straightforward type validation and data assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of declarative configuration classes with input validation primarily based on type checks. There are no external system interactions, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The structure is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The validation is simple and appropriate for configuration data. The serialization methods prepare data for external use but do not perform any insecure operations. Overall, the code is benign and standard for configuration modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration data model for an Evergreen CI system, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
