{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for creating and configuring build variants, task specifications, and display task definitions for a build system, likely used for automated CI/CD pipelines.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is passed through class constructors and method calls with internal validation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no network or system calls present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters into class attributes, with validation checks, without external or untrusted input sources. No untrusted data flows into critical system functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for build variant and task configuration, with input validation and straightforward data storage. All validation appears to prevent type errors, and there are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or hidden backdoors. The classes are designed to be used in a controlled manner, and do not perform any system modifications, network communications, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration class implementation for build automation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malware. It appears safe and purely functional within its described scope.",
