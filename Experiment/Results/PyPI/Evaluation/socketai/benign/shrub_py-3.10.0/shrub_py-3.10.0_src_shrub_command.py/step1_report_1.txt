{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for constructing command definitions and sequences, likely used for executing scripted commands in an automation framework.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods such as function(), type(), name(), command(), timeout(), variant(), var(), vars(), param(), params() which accept external input for configuring commands.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of user-provided values to internal attributes such as _function_name, _execution_type, _display_name, _command_name, _timeout, _variants, _vars, _params; no direct output or network operations are performed.",
  "flows": "User input flows from method parameters into internal attributes via setters; these are stored in class instances for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no code that dynamically executes strings, eval, exec, or network calls; no obfuscated or suspicious language features; no malicious backdoors or hidden functions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines builder classes for commands and command sequences, with straightforward setters and list management functions. All methods perform type checks and store parameters without executing or transmitting data. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, file operations, or code injection. The structure appears to be a standard API for command configuration. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden data leaks, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, seemingly benign API for building command configurations. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is likely a utility component for an automation or orchestration framework.",
