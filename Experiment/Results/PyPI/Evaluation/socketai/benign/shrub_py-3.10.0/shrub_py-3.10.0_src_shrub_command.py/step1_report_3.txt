{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for constructing and managing command sequences in an evergreen deployment or automation system, including configuration and parameter setting functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods such as 'function', 'type', 'name', 'command', 'timeout', 'variant', 'vars', and 'params'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of values to internal attributes like '_function_name', '_execution_type', '_display_name', '_command_name', '_timeout', '_variants', '_vars', and '_params'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided inputs through method parameters to internal attributes, with no external data transmission or untrusted data handling beyond local assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code relies on standard class and method structures. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic present. No network or system commands are invoked.",
  "analysis": "The classes provide an API for building command sequences with various parameters. All input validation is limited to type checks, ensuring data integrity. No code injection, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be purely for configuration and command orchestration without external or malicious interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of command sequence configuration with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It mainly handles data encapsulation and method chaining for command definitions. The overall security risk is minimal.",
