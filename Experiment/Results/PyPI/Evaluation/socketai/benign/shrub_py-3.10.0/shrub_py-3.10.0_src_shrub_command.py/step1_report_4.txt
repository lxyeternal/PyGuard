{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for constructing command definitions and sequences for use with the 'shrub' framework, likely for automation or orchestration tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through method parameters such as fun_name, execution_type, name, command, timeout, variants, and dictionaries for vars and params.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of variables like _function_name, _execution_type, _display_name, _command_name, _timeout, _variants, _vars, _params; no direct data output or network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and stored in class attributes. No untrusted data flows to system commands, network, or external interfaces within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward data structure setup with validation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The classes serve to build command configurations and sequences with proper input validation. No suspicious functions, no external data access beyond parameter assignment, and no malicious patterns detected. The structure appears standard for configuration object modeling. No code injection, external communication, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of configuration classes with input validation. No malicious activity or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign utility for command orchestration within a larger framework.",
