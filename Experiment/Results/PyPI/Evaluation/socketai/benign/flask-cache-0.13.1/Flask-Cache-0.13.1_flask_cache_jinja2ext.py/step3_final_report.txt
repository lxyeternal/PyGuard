{
  "purpose": "Implements a Jinja2 extension to cache template fragments, parsing cache parameters and managing cache storage via Flask-Caching.",
  "sources": "Template tag parameters: timeout, fragment name, vary_on list; template filename and line number for default key.",
  "sinks": "Cache get, set, delete operations via cache object in environment.",
  "flows": "Parsing cache tag -> generating cache key -> cache delete if 'del' -> cache get -> cache set if miss -> return cached or generated content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; relies on external cache infrastructure; no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Jinja2 extension for fragment caching, parsing parameters, generating cache keys with 'make_template_fragment_key', and performing cache operations. It contains no malicious or suspicious logic, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The cache interactions are standard, and the code's purpose is clear. The reliance on external cache backend is typical and not inherently risky. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Jinja2 extension for fragment caching. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting dependence on external cache infrastructure but no inherent risk in the code itself.",
