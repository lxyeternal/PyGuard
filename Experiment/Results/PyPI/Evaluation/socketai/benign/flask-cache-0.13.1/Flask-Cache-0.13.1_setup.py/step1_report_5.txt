  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Flask-Cache package, providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Importing setuptools and reading the module's docstring (__doc__).",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script solely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic execution observed. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static metadata about the package, including name, version, URL, author, description, and dependencies. The long_description is derived from the module's docstring. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are used. The code functions solely as a package setup script, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
