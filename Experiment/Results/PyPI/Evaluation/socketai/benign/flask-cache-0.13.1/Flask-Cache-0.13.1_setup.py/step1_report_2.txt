  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Flask-Cache Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Data read from the script itself, including package metadata and install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and other parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, no reading from external inputs at runtime, nor any suspicious or malicious code patterns. All data used (metadata and dependencies) are hardcoded and typical for a Python package setup. No indications of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
