  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, only defining package metadata and dependencies.\n- No untrusted data sources, external command executions, or network operations are present.\n- The package dependencies are standard, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk score is 0, as the script does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are very uniform and do not consider any hidden or malicious intent that might be embedded elsewhere, but based solely on the provided code, none exists.\n- The use of `__doc__` for `long_description` is standard and safe.\n- The dependencies are typical and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no security concerns.",
