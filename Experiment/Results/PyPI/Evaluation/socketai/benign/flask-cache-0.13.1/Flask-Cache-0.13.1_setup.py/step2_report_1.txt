  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup.py script.\n- No dynamic code, external inputs, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The package metadata and dependencies are standard and static.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, matching the clear, standard code.\n- Risk score: 0 in all reports, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues found in the code itself.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly concluding no security risks.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- Since the code is a standard setup script, there are no reasons to assign higher risk or malware scores.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), which is justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup.py for a Python package.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security concerns.",
