  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, including name, version, URL, author info, description, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data inputs; no external command executions or network operations.",
  "flows": "The script's flow is static; it initializes package configuration without dynamic data or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated segments. The package dependencies are standard, and the use of __doc__ is safe. The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
