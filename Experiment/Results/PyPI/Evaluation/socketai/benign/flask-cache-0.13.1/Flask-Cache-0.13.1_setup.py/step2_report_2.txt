  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward, standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- No reports identify any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- All scores assigned are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code simply imports `setuptools` and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- No evidence of code execution beyond package configuration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The dependencies are standard and explicitly listed.\n- The use of `__doc__` for `long_description` is typical and safe.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- Malware score: 0 in all reports. This is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as no obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.\n- Security risk score: 0, since the script does not handle untrusted input or perform risky operations.\n- Confidence level: 1, reflecting high certainty based on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is a benign setup script.\n- No adjustments needed for the scores.\n- No further security concerns are identified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I agree with the provided scores.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence remains at 1.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
