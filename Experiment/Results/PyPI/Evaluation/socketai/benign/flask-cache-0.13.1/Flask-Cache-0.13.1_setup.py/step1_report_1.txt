  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Flask-Cache Python package, facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Data read from the package's metadata (name, version, author, description, etc.), external dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; the setup script mainly defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads package info and dependencies, and passes them to setuptools for package creation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The script uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup.py for a Python package, importing setuptools and defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code executes external commands, handles user input, or contains obfuscated or malicious code. The dependencies are standard, and there are no signs of data leaks or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
