  "conclusion": "The code is a typical cache management implementation with a notable security concern due to the use of pickle serialization/deserialization, which can execute arbitrary code if untrusted data is processed. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary risk stems from potential exploitation if cache data is compromised, warranting a moderate security risk score. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent. To mitigate risks, replacing pickle with safer serialization methods (e.g., JSON) and adding data validation is recommended."
