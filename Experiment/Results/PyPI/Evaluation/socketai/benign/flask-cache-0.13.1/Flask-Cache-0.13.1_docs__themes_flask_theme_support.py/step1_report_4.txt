{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments based on the Tango style, to be used in syntax highlighting in projects that utilize Pygments.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class definition setting style attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; static style definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static code configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code imports style and token classes from the pygments library and defines a subclass FlaskyStyle that sets various style attributes for syntax tokens. It primarily assigns color and font styles to different token types, with no input handling, no data processing, and no external dependencies beyond style configuration. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign style customization for syntax highlighting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static style configuration for Pygments with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It serves a purely cosmetic purpose, and there are no indicators of malware or malicious activity.",
