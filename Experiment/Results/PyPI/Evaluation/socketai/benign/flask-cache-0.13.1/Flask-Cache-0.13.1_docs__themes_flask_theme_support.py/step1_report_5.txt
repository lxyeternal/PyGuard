{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class attributes and style definitions within FlaskyStyle",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data handling, external inputs, or outputs are present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, no source-to-sink pathways, no dynamic code execution",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. Style definitions are static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a style class for syntax highlighting, specifying color schemes for various token types. It imports necessary modules, declares a class with style properties, and assigns style strings to different token types. No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present. The structure is consistent with a static style configuration intended for Pygments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static style configuration for Pygments syntax highlighter, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and serves a benign purpose.",
