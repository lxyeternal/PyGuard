{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pygments.style' and 'pygments.token', class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no output or data manipulation beyond style definition.",
  "flows": "N/A - static style configuration, no data flow from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a straightforward style configuration without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling classes from the Pygments library and defines a subclass 'FlaskyStyle' with a set of style attributes for various token types. There are no functions, no external inputs, and no logic that manipulates data or performs operations beyond style assignment. The code appears to be a static configuration for syntax highlighting, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It adheres to a typical pattern of style class definitions in Pygments and does not interact with external systems or data sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for syntax highlighting in Pygments. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe to use as intended for styling code syntax.",
