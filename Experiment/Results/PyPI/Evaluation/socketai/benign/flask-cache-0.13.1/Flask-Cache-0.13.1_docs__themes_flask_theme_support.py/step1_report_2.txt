  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments based on the Tango style.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments style components and token types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external network or file interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static style definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The code solely defines style properties.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling classes from Pygments and defines a subclass 'FlaskyStyle' with specific color and style settings for syntax highlighting tokens. The style configuration appears standard and consistent, with no dynamic code execution, external data access, or obfuscated logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or unusual code patterns. It is purely a static configuration for styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward style definition for Pygments with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a static styling class for syntax highlighting purposes.",
