  "purpose": "Static style configuration for Pygments syntax highlighting, defining color and style for code tokens.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Style and token classes; class attribute definitions setting style properties.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external interactions, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of style properties within the class; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static subclass defining a syntax highlighting style for Pygments, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or obfuscation. It consists solely of style attribute assignments, which are safe and standard. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for Pygments with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No further action or warnings are necessary.",
