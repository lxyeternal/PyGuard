  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with import statements, path adjustments, and setting variables for documentation generation. It imports version information from 'flask_cache' but does not use it insecurely or maliciously. No dynamic execution, network operations, or other suspicious activities are present. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical configuration file for documentation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It only sets up parameters for Sphinx documentation generation.",
