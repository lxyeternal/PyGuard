  "purpose": "Configuration file for building Flask-Cache documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, and specific variables from flask_cache; reads configuration parameters; file system paths; and package version variables.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily sets configuration options for documentation generation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No usage of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity. The code solely manages documentation build settings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with typical imports, path adjustments, and documentation settings. It imports version variables from 'flask_cache' module but does not process or output any data from untrusted sources. All configuration options are static. No network, cryptographic, or input/output operations that could be malicious are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file for generating documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No indicators of malware or obfuscation are identified. The overall security risk is negligible.",
