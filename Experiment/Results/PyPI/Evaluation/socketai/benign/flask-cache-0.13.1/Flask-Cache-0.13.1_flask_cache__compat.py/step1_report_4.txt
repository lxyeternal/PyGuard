  "purpose": "Provide Python 2/3 compatibility support for the flask_cache package by defining version-specific variables.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.version_info, sys attributes, and importing sys module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that handles untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input from sys attributes influences the assignment of variables but does not lead to any external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python major version and whether the interpreter is PyPy. It then assigns 'range_type' to 'range' in Python 3 or 'xrange' in Python 2, facilitating compatibility. The code is straightforward, relies on standard library attributes, and does not perform any network, file, or system modification actions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple compatibility shim with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to define version-specific behavior and does not contain malicious behavior.",
