  "purpose": "Detects Python environment version and whether running under PyPy, assigning a type alias accordingly for compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, hasattr(sys, 'pypy_translation_info')",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs environment detection only",
  "flows": "sys attributes to variables for environment detection",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward environment checks without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, checks sys.version_info to determine Python version, inspects sys for 'pypy_translation_info' to detect PyPy, and assigns range_type to range or xrange accordingly. No data flows involve untrusted sources, no network or file operations, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is a minimal, standard compatibility utility with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment detection utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given its benign nature.",
