{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support for Python 2 and Python 3 in the flask_cache package.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to determine Python version; hasattr(sys, 'pypy_translation_info') to detect Pypy.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or output found.",
  "flows": "The code flow sets the variable range_type based on the Python version.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the Python version and the Pypy interpreter by inspecting sys attributes. It then assigns the appropriate range function to range_type depending on the Python version. This is a common compatibility pattern. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any code injection points. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple compatibility shim without any malicious intent or security risks. It is well within normal patterns for supporting multiple Python versions.",
