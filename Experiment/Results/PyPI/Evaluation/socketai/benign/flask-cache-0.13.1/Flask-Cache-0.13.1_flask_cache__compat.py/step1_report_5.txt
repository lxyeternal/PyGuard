  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support for Python 2 and Python 3 in the flask_cache package.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version information from sys.version_info and sys attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to a security issue are present.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → PY2 check → range_type assignment",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements present. The code is straightforward compatibility logic.",
  "analysis": "The code determines if the Python interpreter is Python 2 or 3 and sets the variable range_type accordingly. It also checks if running under PYPY. The logic relies solely on standard library attributes and does not perform any unsafe operations or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. This appears to be standard compatibility code, not malware or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads version info to set compatibility variables and does not process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
