  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support for Python 2 and 3 in the flask_cache library, based on a simplified version of six.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module, accessing sys.version_info, and checking for 'pypy_translation_info' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are processed or generated.",
  "flows": "The code reads Python version information and environment attributes; no data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to determine Python runtime version and environment (PyPy). It sets a variable based on the Python version. This is standard compatibility handling with no malicious intent. No external data, network calls, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility with no signs of malicious behavior. It only checks environment attributes and defines a type alias accordingly.",
