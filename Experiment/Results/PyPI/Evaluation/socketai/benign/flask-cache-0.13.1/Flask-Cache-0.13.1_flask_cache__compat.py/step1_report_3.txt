  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support between Python 2 and Python 3, specifically for the 'flask_cache' package.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info and checks for PYPY attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "Reads sys.version_info to determine Python version, then sets 'range_type' accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code; straightforward compatibility logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, checks Python major version, and whether running on PyPy. Based on Python version, it assigns 'range_type' to either 'range' or 'xrange'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is simple, maintaining compatibility without performing any dangerous actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
