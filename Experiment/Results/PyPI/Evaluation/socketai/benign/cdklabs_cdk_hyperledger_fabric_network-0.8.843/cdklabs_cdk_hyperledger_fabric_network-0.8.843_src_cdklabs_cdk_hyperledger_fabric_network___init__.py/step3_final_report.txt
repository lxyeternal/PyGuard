{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes, enums, and data structures for managing Hyperledger Fabric networks via AWS CDK, including resource creation, secret management, and configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, class properties, type hints, and secret management via AWS Secrets Manager.",
  "sinks": "SDK calls, resource provisioning, secret retrieval, and property access; all standard for infrastructure code.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from constructor inputs to resource creation and secret handling; no external untrusted data flows or malicious data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. Code structure is typical for SDK wrappers and infrastructure-as-code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured SDK for deploying Hyperledger Fabric networks on AWS, with standard practices for secret management and resource configuration. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code relies on AWS CDK constructs, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The secret handling is appropriate, and resource interactions follow best practices. The confidence in the benign nature of this code is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, open-source infrastructure code for managing Hyperledger Fabric networks. It contains no malicious, sabotage, or obfuscated elements. The low malware and obfuscation scores (0), along with a minimal security risk (~0.1-0.2), accurately reflect its safe and standard nature.",
