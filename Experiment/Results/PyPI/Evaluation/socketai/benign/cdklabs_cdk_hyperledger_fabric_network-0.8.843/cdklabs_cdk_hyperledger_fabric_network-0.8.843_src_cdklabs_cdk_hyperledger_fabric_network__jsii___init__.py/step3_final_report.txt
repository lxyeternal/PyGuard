  "purpose": "Module setup involving extending __path__, version-dependent typeguard checks, loading a JSII assembly for AWS CDK constructs, and publishing the package.",
  "sources": "Reading __path__, importing dependencies, fetching package version, loading JSII assembly, calling publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations; only assembly load and publish steps",
  "flows": "Source: version fetch / module import -> Assembly load -> publication publish",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization tasks: extending module path, performing version-dependent typeguard checks, loading a JSII assembly for AWS CDK constructs, and publishing the package. No malicious activity, network communication, or data exfiltration is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common patterns for namespace packages and JSII integrations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical flaws or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, routine package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified and appropriate.",
