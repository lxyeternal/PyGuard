  "purpose": "Define package metadata and initiate setup process for the Python package using static JSON data and README.md content.",
  "sources": "Static JSON string containing package info; local file 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function which processes the provided metadata; no untrusted sinks detected.",
  "flows": "JSON data loaded into 'kwargs' -> 'long_description' read from 'README.md' -> passed to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of static JSON string; assumes 'README.md' exists; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code loads static package metadata from a hardcoded JSON string, reads a local README.md file, and calls setuptools.setup() with this data. No external inputs, network activity, or code obfuscation are present. The JSON is well-formed and static, with no secrets or malicious payloads. The use of open() assumes the file exists but is standard practice. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
