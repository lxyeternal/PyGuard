{
  "purpose": "The code configures and sets up a Python package for distribution, primarily defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the JSON string embedded in the script and the external 'README.md' file read for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The data is used in 'setuptools.setup()' for package configuration; no untrusted data is passed to system commands or sensitive system APIs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the JSON string to the 'kwargs' dictionary, then from 'kwargs' into 'setuptools.setup()'. The contents of 'README.md' are read and assigned to 'long_description' in 'kwargs'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly handles package setup. No obfuscated or malicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from an embedded JSON string, reads an external README.md file for description, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The dependencies specified are standard and relevant for package setup. The structure and formatting are consistent with typical setup scripts. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It performs expected operations for packaging a Python project.",
