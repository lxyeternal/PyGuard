  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation builder, setting up project info, extensions, themes, and output options.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments, comments, and commented-out setup instructions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output, no network activity, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It contains only comments, variable assignments, and optional commented sections. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network calls, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's structure and content are typical for such configuration files, and all security and malware scores are appropriately zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
