  "purpose": "Configuration settings for generating documentation with Sphinx for the Flask-SocketIO project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'extensions' list, file paths ('_templates', '_static'), and various configuration variables (e.g., 'html_theme', 'latex_documents', etc.).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects; no untrusted data is used in critical operations or executed.",
  "flows": "The data flows from configuration variables into the Sphinx build process but do not involve untrusted or malicious data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated sections, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is standard configuration code for Sphinx documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely configuration for Sphinx documentation, setting up themes, paths, extensions, and output formats. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or executable code are present. The code is static and standard for documentation setup, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for documentation purposes.",
