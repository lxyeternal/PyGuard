{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Flask extension for Socket.IO, managing server lifecycle, event handling, session management, and client communication within a Flask application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'FLASK_RUN_FROM_CLI', 'SERVER_NAME'), imports, and Flask request context for session and client data.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit(), app.run(), server start/stop methods, environment variable checks, and event handlers.",
  "flows": "Initialization reads environment variables; event handlers process client data; server lifecycle methods control server operation; environment variables influence configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; environment variable usage is standard for configuration; no suspicious network activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask-SocketIO server setup with environment validation, session management, and event handling. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. Environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical. The server lifecycle management and event registration follow best practices. No suspicious data flows or code injections are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Flask extension for Socket.IO, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of environment variables and server control functions are standard and do not indicate security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
