{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Namespace class for socket.io events, allowing event handling, message emitting, and room management in a WebSocket context.",
  "sources": "Code reads event names, data payloads, room identifiers, and callback functions from method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Methods invoke socketio methods which could send data over the network or manipulate client connections; no direct data leaks or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Event names and data flow from method inputs to socketio method calls; user-controlled data can trigger events or messages, but no external data sources or insecure handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The code primarily delegates functionality to socketio object methods without performing any malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates socket.io namespace interactions, providing methods to trigger events, emit messages, send data, and close rooms. It relies on an external socketio object for core functionalities. No suspicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious control flows, are present. The code appears standard and does not contain obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard wrapper around socket.io Namespace functionality, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely delegates actions to socketio methods and does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
