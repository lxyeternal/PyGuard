{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module import paths, perform type checking, load a JSII assembly related to AWS CDK, and publish the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version retrieval via importlib.metadata, and the jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() function.",
  "sinks": "The call to jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() potentially loads external assembly files; publication.publish() could execute publishing actions.",
  "flows": "Importing dependencies -> Retrieving package version -> Configuring typeguard -> Loading JSII assembly -> Publishing module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic assembly loading with version-dependent logic is typical but warrants attention. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors are present. The call to 'publication.publish()' at the end could perform external actions, but this is context-dependent. No obfuscated code, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module setup and dynamic loading of an AWS CDK-related assembly using jsii. It employs conditional logic based on package version for type checking. The use of external assembly loading and the publish function is standard for packaging and deployment workflows. No suspicious behaviors such as malicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The code structure is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python module involving jsii and AWS CDK components. It does not show any signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of dynamic assembly loading and publishing functions is consistent with normal deployment processes. Overall, it appears safe.",
