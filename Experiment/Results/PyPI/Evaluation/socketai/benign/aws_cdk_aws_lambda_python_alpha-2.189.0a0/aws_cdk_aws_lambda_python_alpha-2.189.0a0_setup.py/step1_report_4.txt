{
  "purpose": "The code prepares package metadata and setup configuration for a Python package distribution, specifically for AWS CDK Lambda in Python.",
  "sources": "json.loads() for package metadata, open('README.md') for long_description",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() for package installation process",
  "flows": "json.loads() data to setuptools.setup() parameters, file reading to 'long_description'",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, no malicious file handling.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README.md file for the long description, and then calls setuptools.setup() with this data. All operations are standard for Python packaging. No untrusted input processing, no dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, or other suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
