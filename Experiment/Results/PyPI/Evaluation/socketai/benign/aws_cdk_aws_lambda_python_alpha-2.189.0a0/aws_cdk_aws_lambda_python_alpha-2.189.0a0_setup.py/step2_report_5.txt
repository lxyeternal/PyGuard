  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code loads static JSON package metadata, reads a README.md, and calls setuptools.setup(). No malicious activity or anomalies detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward, and no suspicious behavior is present. The report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard package setup with static data, no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static JSON, reading README, calling setuptools.setup(). No suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.  \n- **Note:** The securityRisk is slightly above zero, but given the code's simplicity, this seems overestimated. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity are present.  \n- **Assessment:** The score could be lowered to 0, as no real security risk exists.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Identical to previous reports—standard setup script with static data.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard package setup code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Note:** Again, the security risk score seems inflated given the code's static and benign nature.  \n- **Assessment:** Should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with no malicious activity observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, code is straightforward and static.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), but based on the code, there's no actual security concern. The code doesn't handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The overall malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n- The security risk scores should be **0** for all reports, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The small elevation to 0.1 appears unjustified; it should be adjusted downward.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, static package setup script with no security concerns.",
