{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components and utilities related to console menus and formatting for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (items, console_menu, menu_formatter, multiselect_menu, prompt_utils, selection_menu, version), and a specific import from consolemenu.prompt_utils",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or data, nor any data output or network operations",
  "flows": "The code only performs static imports and assigns __all__; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The import of 'UserQuit' from 'consolemenu.prompt_utils' is noted but appears standard, not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements organizing module exports for a package. No dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The presence of multiple imports from local modules and a specific import from a package suggests modular design, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply consolidates and exposes components of a console menu library.",
