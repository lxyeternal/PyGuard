{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components related to console menus and utilities, and defines an export list for use in other parts of a project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and one from 'consolemenu.prompt_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and sets an export list; there are no data flows or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. The import statements are straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ definition to specify module exports. It imports various classes and functions related to console menus and utilities, likely for user interface purposes. No dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication is present. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The presence of an import from a different package ('consolemenu.prompt_utils') might warrant a quick check, but it appears consistent with local modules.\n\nOverall, the code is simple, structured, and appears benign. No security risks or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign module that organizes and exports console menu components. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
