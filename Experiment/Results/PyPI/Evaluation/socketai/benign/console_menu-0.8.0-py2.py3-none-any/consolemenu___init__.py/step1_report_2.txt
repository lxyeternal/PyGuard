{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components and utility functions related to console menus and formatting, and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.items, .console_menu, .menu_formatter, etc.) and an external import 'consolemenu.prompt_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data handling, external data processing, or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The import of 'consolemenu.prompt_utils' from an external package appears standard, but no malicious activity is indicated.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports and exports for a console menu system. All imports are from local or well-known external packages, with no indication of data processing, user input handling, or network activity. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden functionality. There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows, and no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export setup for a console menu library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for organizing console interface components.",
