  "purpose": "This code module imports various components and utilities related to console menu interfaces and defines what is exported for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: items, console_menu, menu_formatter, multiselect_menu, prompt_utils, selection_menu, version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data handling; this code primarily involves importing and exporting modules",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or untrusted input/output present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing various components from local modules and setting the __all__ attribute for exports. No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present. All imported modules appear to be for user interface purposes (console menus) and version info. There are no signs of malicious logic or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple import and export setup for console menu components. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet.",
