  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import/export module for console menu components.\n- No suspicious behaviors, data flows, or external communications are identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The only external import is 'consolemenu.prompt_utils', which appears standard.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform dynamic execution, or handle sensitive data.\n- The import of 'consolemenu.prompt_utils' from an external package is consistent with module organization, not malicious activity.\n- The __all__ list clearly defines the public API, typical for such modules.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk: All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n**Any potential issues?**\n- No. The code is simple, well-structured, and does not exhibit any signs of compromise or malicious intent.\n- The import from 'consolemenu.prompt_utils' might warrant a quick check in a broader context, but on its own, it is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no evidence of security risks or malware.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action needed based on this code snippet.\n- The code appears safe and intended for organizing module exports.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward module that imports various console menu components and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
