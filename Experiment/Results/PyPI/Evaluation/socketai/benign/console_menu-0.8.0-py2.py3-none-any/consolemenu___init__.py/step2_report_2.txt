  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward import statements and export definitions (`__all__`), with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The only external import is `consolemenu.prompt_utils`, which appears to be a standard dependency.\n- The code is purely organizational, meant to structure module exports for a console menu system.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Claim:** No malicious behavior, straightforward import/export.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Claim:** Same as above, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Claim:** Similar, no anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Claim:** Benign, standard import/export module.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Claim:** Same benign structure, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are there any signs of malicious activity?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as purely organizational, with no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious logic.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All malware scores are 0, reflecting no malicious code. Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** Given the analysis, **0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, **0** is justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, benign module that imports and exports components related to console menus. No security risks or malware indicators are present. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified based on the provided code snippet.",
