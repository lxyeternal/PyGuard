  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module that imports various components related to console menu interfaces and utilities, then defines an `__all__` list to specify what is exported. There are no functions, data processing, dynamic code execution, or external communications involved.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is simply importing modules and defining exports. No issues are present in the actual code snippet.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious imports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Consistency of scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Potential overestimation:** None of the reports claim any vulnerabilities or risks beyond benign module organization.\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The import from `'consolemenu.prompt_utils'` is consistent with local or external packages, but nothing suspicious is indicated.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Higher risk scores:** Not justified; the code is purely structural.\n- **Malware justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains 0.\n- **Obfuscated code:** None, so obfuscated score remains 0.\n- **Security risk:** No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code snippet, **the overall risk is negligible**. The code is a benign module for organizing and exporting console interface components.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk in this code. All scores should remain at zero, reflecting the benign nature of this module.",
