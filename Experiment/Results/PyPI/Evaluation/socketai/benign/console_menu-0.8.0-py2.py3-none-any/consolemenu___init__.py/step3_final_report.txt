  "purpose": "Organize and export console menu components for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and an external package 'consolemenu.prompt_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module setup with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports various components related to console menus and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external import from 'consolemenu.prompt_utils' is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not process untrusted input, perform dynamic execution, or contain any hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving solely as a module initializer and exporter for console menu components. There are no indications of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
