{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components related to console menus and utilities, and defines the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.items, .console_menu, .menu_formatter, etc.) and external consolemenu.prompt_utils",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only performs imports and __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. The import from 'consolemenu.prompt_utils' may indicate external dependency, but it is explicitly imported.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, defining the module's API. No functions, data processing, or external communications are present. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The imports are standard for organizing a modular Python project. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer that imports components and defines exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended for organizing code structure.",
