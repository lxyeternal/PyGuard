  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports various components and defines an `__all__` list.\n- No suspicious behaviors, data flows, or external communications are present.\n- The imports are from local modules and a known external package (`consolemenu.prompt_utils`), which appears standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is purely organizational, serving as an entry point or module initializer.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only external import is `consolemenu.prompt_utils`, which is consistent with the rest of the code structure.\n- The presence of `UserQuit` imported from `consolemenu.prompt_utils` is standard and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No evidence of code injection, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Scores and their justification:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No claims in the reports suggest potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on the code snippet.\n- The import from an external package does not inherently pose a risk unless that package is compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, benign module setup for a console menu system.\n- There are no signs of supply chain issues, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is safe, with no security risks or malicious activity detected. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
