  "purpose": "A console menu class allowing multi-selection of items with range and list input parsing, intended for CLI user interaction.",
  "sources": "User input via self.screen.input() in process_user_input method.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network connections, or file operations; data flows only within the application.",
  "flows": "User input → parsing functions (__parse_range, __parse_range_list) → selection logic.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling in process_user_input may obscure input errors; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward multi-select menu with range parsing, using standard Python libraries and patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling silently ignores errors, which is common but could mask user mistakes. The input parsing functions are standard and correctly implemented. No external effects or data leaks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a CLI multi-select menu with range parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor concern regarding silent exception handling does not elevate the risk meaningfully. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain inclusion.",
