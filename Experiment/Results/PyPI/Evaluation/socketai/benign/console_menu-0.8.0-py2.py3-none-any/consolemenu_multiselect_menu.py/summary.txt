  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a CLI multi-select menu with range parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor concern regarding silent exception handling does not elevate the risk meaningfully. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain inclusion."
