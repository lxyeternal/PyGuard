  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly describes the code as a multi-select console menu with range parsing.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling silently ignores errors, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Safe, standard UI code with high confidence (0.9), malware (0), obfuscated (0), and security risk (0).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusions are accurate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the code.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No suspicious code or behavior. Uses standard parsing techniques.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Benign, with full confidence (1), malware (0), obfuscated (0), security risk (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly states the code's function.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the silent exception handling, which could obscure errors but isn't malicious.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Still benign. The security risk score is marginally higher but justified given the silent exception handling.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The security risk score could be marginally increased but remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. Slightly higher security risk (0.1), possibly due to reliance on user input parsing, but this is standard.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** The code is safe and benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & analysis:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses standard techniques.\n- **Conclusion & confidence:** Benign, with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are consistent with no malicious activity (score 0). The code only handles user input parsing and menu display.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) mainly due to silent exception handling, which can obscure user errors but isn't malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** at most, primarily due to silent exception handling which could mask errors but isn't a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of a multi-select console menu with range parsing. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The existing scores are appropriate, but I would slightly lower the security risk score to 0.1 for consistency.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the code's safe, transparent nature and minimal risk profile.",
