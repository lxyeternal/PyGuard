{
  "purpose": "This code implements a console-based menu system with classes for menus and menu items, allowing user interaction, navigation, and execution of actions associated with menu options.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via get_input() (which calls screen.input()), retrieves text or callables for titles, subtitles, prologue, and epilogue, and accesses menu items for selection and action.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data (user input) influences menu navigation and selection; action methods could potentially perform operations based on menu selections.",
  "flows": "User input → process_user_input() → updates current_option or executes item.action() → potentially triggers further actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code uses threading to run menus asynchronously, but does not contain hidden or obfuscated code. The presence of 'reset' command for clearing terminal is benign. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a menu system with classes for menus and items, supporting dynamic addition/removal of items, user interaction via input, and threaded operation. Input handling converts characters and numbers to menu actions without any external data transmission. The code appears standard for terminal menus, with no suspicious external calls, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The threading implementation is typical and safe, without suspicious network or file operations. No potential malware signals or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward terminal menu implementation with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It functions as a user interface component without external data leaks or harmful operations.",
