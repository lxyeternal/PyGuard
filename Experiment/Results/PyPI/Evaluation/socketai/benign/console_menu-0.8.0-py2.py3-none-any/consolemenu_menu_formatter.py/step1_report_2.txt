{
  "purpose": "The code defines a builder class for creating and formatting a menu UI in a console application, primarily setting styles, borders, paddings, and content for various menu sections.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters like border_style, border_style_type, margins, paddings, and menu content such as title, subtitle, prologue, epilogue, and items; all of which are used for configuration and content setting.",
  "sinks": "Generated menu content; no direct data sinks or external outputs are present in the code. No network, file, or environment variable operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration methods set style and layout attributes; the format() method compiles these into a string representation of the menu. Data flows from user-configurable inputs through setters into the formatted output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code primarily manipulates style and layout objects without executing untrusted data as code. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a menu formatting builder. It uses well-defined classes and methods to set styles, paddings, margins, borders, and content sections. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden code. The methods are for style configuration and content assembly, which do not interact with external systems or execute untrusted code. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate UI component builder with no malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard menu styling and formatting builder without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The overall security risk score is very low.",
