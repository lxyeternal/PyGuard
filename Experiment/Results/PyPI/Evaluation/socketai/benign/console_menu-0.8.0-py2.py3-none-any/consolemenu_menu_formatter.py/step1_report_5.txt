{
  "purpose": "The code defines a builder class for configuring and generating menu formatting in a console application, with no apparent malicious intent or behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters such as title, subtitle, prologue_text, epilogue_text, items, and prompt, and also from internal class attributes and properties. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly accessed within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "The primary sinks are the generate() method calls on various section objects, which produce strings for output. There are no evident sinks that send data over the network, write to files, or perform other side effects based on untrusted data within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (title, subtitle, prologue_text, epilogue_text, items, prompt) into internal attributes of menu sections, then these sections generate strings which are concatenated into the final menu string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard class and method structures for UI formatting; there are no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or insecure patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a configuration builder for a console menu UI, involving setting styles, margins, borders, and text alignment for various menu sections. It reads input data through method parameters and class attributes, then assembles the output string via generate() method calls on sections. The class design adheres to standard practices, and no suspicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or malicious activity is present. There are no network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. Overall, this appears to be a benign, well-structured UI configuration utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard menu formatting builder with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages UI configuration data and produces formatted menu strings without any suspicious behavior.",
