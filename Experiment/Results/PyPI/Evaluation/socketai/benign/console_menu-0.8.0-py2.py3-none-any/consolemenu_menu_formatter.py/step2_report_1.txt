  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes a menu builder for console UI.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Straightforward data flow; no external or untrusted input sources.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious behavior; standard styling and layout code.\n- Conclusion: Very low security threat, benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1; a menu styling and formatting builder.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Configuration parameters and output strings; no external data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, standard pattern; no malicious features.\n- Conclusion: Very low security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Again, a menu formatting utility.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input parameters for styling and content; output is a formatted string.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behavior; purely UI string formatting.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above; a style/layout builder.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard data flow; no external or untrusted data sources.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; standard configuration code.\n- Conclusion: No security risks.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar menu builder.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Input parameters and generated strings; no external data leaks.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard utility.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate the code is purely for UI layout and styling, with no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard patterns. No obfuscation detected; score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, external data leaks, or dangerous operations, the overall security risk is **very low**. A score of **0.1** (as per reports) seems reasonable, but could be even lower, e.g., **0.0**.\n\n### Final justification:\n- The code does not execute untrusted data as code, does not perform network or file operations, and only manipulates internal data structures for UI rendering.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The reports' assessments align with this conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if conservative)\n\nThis code is a benign, standard UI layout builder with no security concerns.",
