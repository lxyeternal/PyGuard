{
  "purpose": "The code is a builder class for constructing and formatting menu displays for console applications, focusing on setting styles, borders, margins, and content sections.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include method parameters such as border_style, border_style_type, margins, paddings, text strings for title, subtitle, prologue, epilogue, prompt, and items.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'format' method, which generates a string output representing the menu; no direct data leaks or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into styling methods and content assignment; the 'format' method consolidates these into a formatted string output. No external untrusted data sources or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code primarily configures styles and generates strings; it does not execute external code or system commands. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The class is designed for menu formatting with configurable styles, margins, and content sections. It performs straightforward data assignments and style settings. The methods validate types for style objects but do not process untrusted input beyond setting content strings, which are used solely for display. There are no network operations, system modifications, or external code execution. The code appears well-structured, with clear separation of styling and content. Overall, there are no suspicious or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a style and layout builder for console menus. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply prepares formatted string content for display purposes. No malicious intent or supply chain vulnerabilities are evident.",
