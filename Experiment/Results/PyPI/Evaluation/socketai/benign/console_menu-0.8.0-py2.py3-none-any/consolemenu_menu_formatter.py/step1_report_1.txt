{
  "purpose": "This code defines a builder class for configuring and generating a menu interface for console applications, focusing on layout, styling, and structure of the menu components.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters such as title, subtitle, prologue_text, epilogue_text, items, and various style settings. No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The primary sinks are the generate() method calls on menu section objects, which produce strings for display. No direct data leaks or external data transmissions are evident. The code does not execute or evaluate untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to section attributes, which are then used by generate() to produce output strings. The data flow is straightforward from input parameters to formatted string output. There are no complex or unsafe data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard class attributes and method calls without suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of a menu builder pattern, configuring visual styles and layout parameters for menu sections. It uses well-defined classes and methods to set properties like padding, borders, margins, and text alignment. The generate() method aggregates sections into a string output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code's logic is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for UI layout code. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign menu layout builder with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles configuration and formatting of menu components without external data dependencies or risky operations. Therefore, it poses a very low security threat.",
