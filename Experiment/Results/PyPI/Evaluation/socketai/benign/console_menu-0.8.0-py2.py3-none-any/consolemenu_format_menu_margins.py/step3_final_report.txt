  "purpose": "A simple class to manage UI menu margins with encapsulated properties for top, left, bottom, and right margins.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; internal attribute assignments via constructor and property setters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external outputs, network calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Direct attribute assignments and property accessors; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward, well-structured class for managing margin values with encapsulation. It contains no external data handling, network operations, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The implementation is standard and safe, with high confidence in benign intent. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing UI margins. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
