  "purpose": "Define a class for managing menu margin dimensions with getters and setters.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network connections, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code features identified.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a simple data structure for menu margins, with initialization parameters and property methods for access and modification. No external data reading, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The code is straightforward, with standard property decorators and no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing a basic data container without malicious intent or security risks.",
