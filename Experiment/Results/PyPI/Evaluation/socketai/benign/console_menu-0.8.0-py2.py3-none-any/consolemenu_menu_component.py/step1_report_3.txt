{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for rendering menu components with styling, borders, and layout in a console-based user interface.",
  "sources": "Reads include import statements, method arguments (e.g., text input, style objects), and properties accessing style configurations.",
  "sinks": "Output of generate() methods which produce formatted strings for display; no apparent data leaks or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and object properties through formatting and rendering methods; no external network or file operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns detected. The code employs ANSI escape handling, but this is standard for styled console output. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically constructs styled menu components with properties controlling layout, borders, and text alignment. It includes safeguards such as type checking for style objects and handles text wrapping with ANSI codes consideration. No malicious code or backdoors are present. Functions are purely for presentation formatting, and no external network or system modifications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of console menu rendering, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within the scope of string formatting and presentation logic, adhering to safe programming practices.",
