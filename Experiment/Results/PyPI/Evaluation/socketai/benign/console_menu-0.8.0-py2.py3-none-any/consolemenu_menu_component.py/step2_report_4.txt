  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a console menu rendering library.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no external system interaction, relies on standard string formatting, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1—console menu rendering.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no network or system modifications, safe use of 'ansiwrap', straightforward string formatting.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above—styled console menu components.  \n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, safe string handling, no external system calls.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Again, a console menu rendering system.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no external system interaction, safe string formatting, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Same core function—console menu UI components.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no external system calls, only string formatting and display logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n- **Note:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) possibly due to conservative assumption about the potential for misuse, but no actual malicious activity is present.  \n**Assessment:** The risk score is slightly elevated but still reasonable given the code's nature. No obfuscation or malware is evident.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior (score=0).  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are clear, with no obfuscation present (score=0).  \n- **Risk Score:** All are at 0 or very low (0.2 in the last report), which is reasonable considering the code's purpose is purely UI rendering.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**  \n- No report suggests any actual security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- The slight increase in the last report's risk score to 0.2 is conservative but acceptable, as it might reflect a cautious stance rather than actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, purely a UI rendering library with minimal risk)  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a straightforward, safe console menu rendering module with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with the code's benign nature. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
