{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for rendering styled console menu components, including headers, sections, items, footers, and prompts, primarily for UI display with ANSI styling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as title, subtitle, text, prompt string, style objects, and menu items; properties accessing style configurations.",
  "sinks": "Generated formatted strings for console output; no external system interactions or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into property accesses and method parameters, which are then formatted into styled strings for display; no external system calls or data leaks occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external system interactions detected; reliance on standard string formatting and ANSI handling is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured UI rendering library for console menus, utilizing safe string operations, style objects, and ANSI code handling. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Slightly elevated risk scores (e.g., 0.2) are conservative and do not reflect actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured console menu rendering library with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
