{
  "purpose": "The code defines various classes for constructing and rendering a console menu interface, including components like headers, text sections, menu items, footers, and prompts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from class properties such as 'title', 'text', 'items', and 'prompt' strings, as well as from method parameters. No external untrusted sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are primarily string generation for console display via 'yield' statements and formatted strings. No direct network, file, or system command interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class properties (titles, texts, items, prompts) through formatting and wrapping functions, ultimately generating strings for display. No external or untrusted data flows to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of conditional import for 'ansiwrap' appears benign. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a console menu rendering system, with clear separation of concerns. It uses property accessors and generator functions for incremental string output. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. The only input data are user-facing strings and internal properties, with no external untrusted sources or system commands invoked. The code leverages safe string formatting, wrapping, and property validation, and does not include any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of a console menu system with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or harmful operations. It is safe for use.",
