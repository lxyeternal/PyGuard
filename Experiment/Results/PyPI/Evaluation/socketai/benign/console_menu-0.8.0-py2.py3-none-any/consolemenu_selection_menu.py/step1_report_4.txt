{
  "purpose": "Defines a SelectionMenu class for creating and displaying a menu from a list of strings using the consolemenu library.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'strings' list parameter in __init__, 'get_selection', and 'append_string' method calls.",
  "sinks": "Display of menu options, user interaction through console input via 'show' and 'join' methods, and appending menu items.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'strings' input to menu items; user interaction triggers menu.show(), and selection is returned via menu.selected_option.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No external network activity or system modifications. Usage of library functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs a user-interactive console menu system based on provided strings. It extends ConsoleMenu with added convenience methods for quick selection and appends menu items dynamically. No input/output data is processed insecurely, no code executes external commands, or handles untrusted input beyond standard console interaction. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a console menu system using the consolemenu library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a benign utility for user interaction.",
