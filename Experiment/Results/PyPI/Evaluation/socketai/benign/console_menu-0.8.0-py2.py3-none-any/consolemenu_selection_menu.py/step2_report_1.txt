  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward extension of a console menu library, creating a menu from a list of strings.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- User input is handled via standard console interactions, with selections returned as indices.\n- The code does not execute dynamic code, external commands, or handle untrusted data insecurely.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Benign UI utility.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent findings.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still no suspicious code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; the minor security risk might stem from the minimal console interaction, but it's negligible.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but similar conclusions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, benign utility.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Highest confidence (1), no anomalies.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Clear benign code.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:**\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree it's not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (~0.1), likely due to the minimal console interaction or generic risk scoring conventions, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** All reports correctly identify the code as a benign UI utility with no malicious intent.\n\n### **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a console menu class.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present.\n- The minor security risk score (~0.1) is acceptable given the context, but it doesn't reflect any real vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score (out of 1) | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                | No malicious activity detected                               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0.05 - 0.1       | Minimal, inherent to console interaction, but not risky    |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe and benign.**",
