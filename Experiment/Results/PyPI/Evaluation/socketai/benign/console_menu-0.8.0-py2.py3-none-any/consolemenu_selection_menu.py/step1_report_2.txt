{
  "purpose": "Defines a customizable selection menu class for console applications, allowing dynamic creation and user selection from a list of options.",
  "sources": "Input list of strings to generate menu items, user input during menu interaction (implied by 'show' and 'join' methods).",
  "sinks": "Potentially, user input (e.g., selected option) is returned; no direct untrusted data handling, no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "User interacts with menu -> selection is captured and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The class methods rely on user interaction; no dynamic code execution or external data sources are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a menu object, populates it with items from a provided list, and displays it for user selection. It includes a class method for simplified use. No external input handling beyond user selection, no malicious functions, no data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be a straightforward UI component with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a console menu system with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs UI operations solely based on user interaction without external data manipulation or network activity.",
