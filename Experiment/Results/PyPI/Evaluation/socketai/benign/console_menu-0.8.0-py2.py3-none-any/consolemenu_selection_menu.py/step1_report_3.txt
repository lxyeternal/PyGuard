  "purpose": "Define a customizable console menu class for selecting options from a list of strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings for menu options via constructor, get_selection method, or append_string method.",
  "sinks": "The menu display and user selection handling; no untrusted data directly affects system state or data flow beyond standard input/output.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> menu creation -> user selection -> return selected index; no external data flows or untrusted data leaks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The code primarily handles UI menu logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a menu class that builds a menu from provided string options and displays it for user selection. It uses standard class inheritance and method calls. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code relies on external consolemenu library for display; usage appears benign. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a console menu system with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely handles input strings for display and selection, with no evident security risks or malware. Overall, it seems benign.",
