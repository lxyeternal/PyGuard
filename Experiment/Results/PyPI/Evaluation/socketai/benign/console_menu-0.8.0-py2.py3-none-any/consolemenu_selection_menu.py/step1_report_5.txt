{
  "purpose": "Defines a customizable selection menu class for console applications using the consolemenu library, allowing dynamic creation and display of menu options.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'strings' list parameter and optional method arguments for menu configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows could occur if untrusted input is used directly in UI elements, but no untrusted data is sent to external systems or affected maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data from 'strings' or method arguments flows into menu items, which are then displayed to the user; user selection is returned as an index.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code segments are present. The code uses standard library calls and object-oriented constructs without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ConsoleMenu that initializes menu items from a list of strings, and provides a class method for quick selection. It uses straightforward iteration and object instantiation. No external or network operations, environment variable usage, or security-sensitive data handling are evident. The class and methods follow typical patterns for UI menu creation, with no signs of malicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a console menu interface with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely constructs and displays menus based on provided string data, with no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
