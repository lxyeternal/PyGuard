  "purpose": "A console menu utility that creates a menu from a list of strings, allowing user selection.",
  "sources": "The list of strings provided during menu creation and user input via console.",
  "sinks": "User's console input/output, no external data or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input strings used to generate menu items; user selection returned as index.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a standard console menu library to generate a menu from a list of strings, display it, and return the selected option. It does not perform network activity, file operations, or execute external commands. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to console interaction, which is typical and safe. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's straightforward structure and lack of external dependencies or suspicious patterns confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign implementation of a console menu utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
