{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility for prompting user input, including password input, validation, and choice selection, within a console application.",
  "sources": "User input via self.__screen.input(), getpass.getpass() for passwords, and validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if input is logged or mishandled; no external network or file operations; no data exfiltration or malicious payloads detected.",
  "flows": "Input collected from user prompts flows from input() or getpass() to validation functions; no external or malicious data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Minor syntax issue in print statement within 'prompt_for_numbered_choice' method (missing f-string or format method), which could cause a runtime error but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for user prompts, password input, and validation. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external connections. The fallback for getpass is standard and does not introduce security issues. The syntax error in print statement is a minor bug but does not impact security. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (0.1) are justified. The minor syntax bug should be corrected for proper execution but does not affect security.",
