{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for prompting user input in a console application, including input validation, password entry, and choice selection.",
  "sources": "Input is read via self.__screen.input() calls, which get user input from the console. No external data sources are directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "User input is processed within the methods and potentially validated; getpass.getpass() is used for password input. No direct data leaks or external data transmissions are observed.",
  "flows": "Sources (user input) flow through validation functions and decision logic for confirmation, choice selection, and password handling, with no external network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses getpass for password masking and exception handling for getpass failure. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard user input utility module, primarily handling console prompts, input validation, and password entry. It uses common patterns such as input loops, validators, and input formatting. The only external dependency is getpass, which is a standard library for password masking. The code includes exception handling for getpass failures but does not execute any untrusted code or network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. Overall, the code appears benign and designed for legitimate console input management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for user interaction in console applications. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It uses standard practices and libraries. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
