{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for prompting and validating user input within a console-based interface, including password input, choice selection, and confirmation.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via self.__screen.input() in multiple methods (input prompts, password prompts, choice selections). Uses getpass.getpass() for password input.",
  "sinks": "User input handling (especially passwords) that could be used maliciously if manipulated. Password input is masked via getpass, which is standard. No data leaks or insecure storage observed.",
  "flows": "Input prompts → user enters data (including passwords, choices, or commands like 'q') → validation or conditional logic. For quit commands, raises UserQuit exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious or obfuscated code. No network activity, file manipulation, or external system interaction. Use of getpass is standard. No backdoors or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on user interaction through console prompts, with validation and choice handling. It uses standard libraries and practices for input collection and validation. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert communication. The flow is typical for a CLI utility. Exception handling for getpass failure is standard. Overall, the code is well-structured for its purpose and contains no malicious or harmful behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a user input utility with no indications of malicious activity or sabotage. It securely handles passwords with getpass and validates input according to provided validators. There are no signs of malware or security risks. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
