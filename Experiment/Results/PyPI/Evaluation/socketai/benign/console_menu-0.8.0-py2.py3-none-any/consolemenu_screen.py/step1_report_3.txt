  "purpose": "Provide a console screen abstraction with utility functions for clearing, flushing, input, and printing.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), subprocess.check_call(), subprocess.check_output(), sys.stdout, sys.version, raw_input/input",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call() and subprocess.check_output() execute system commands; sys.stdout.flush() writes to stdout; input() and print() handle user input/output",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> subprocess.check_call()/subprocess.check_output() for clearing; input() reads from sys.stdin; print() outputs to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; subprocess calls are standard but executing system commands 'cls' or 'clear' may be considered potentially risky if misused, but here they are harmless. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for console manipulation, including clearing the screen, flushing output, taking user input, and printing. It uses standard libraries and system commands. No data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected. The subprocess calls are typical for clearing the screen and do not invoke external malicious code. Input methods handle Python 2 and 3 compatibility. No anomalous or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for console interface management with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs typical functions using standard practices and does not contain hidden or harmful behavior.",
