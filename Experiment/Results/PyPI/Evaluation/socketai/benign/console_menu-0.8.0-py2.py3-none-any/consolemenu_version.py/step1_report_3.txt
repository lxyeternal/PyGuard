  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output points present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as the code only sets a variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the variable __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no input sources, no data processing, no sinks, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors present. The code is very minimal and appears to be part of a larger project, but by itself, it contains no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is harmless, serving solely to define the package version. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
