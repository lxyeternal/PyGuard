  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Issues:**\n   - All reports describe a single line of code: `__version__ = \"0.8.0\"`.\n   - This is a standard practice in Python packages to declare version info.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious operations.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, and no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a minimal, standard version assignment.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, there's no basis for higher risk.\n   - All scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is correct; no malicious activity is detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\nGiven the code snippet is a straightforward version declaration with no inputs, outputs, or suspicious behavior, the scores are appropriate. No further suspicion or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign.",
