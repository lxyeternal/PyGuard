  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or other operations. The code is minimal and standard across Python packages.  \n**Conclusion:** The reported issues are not present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risk:** All are 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince the code is just a version string assignment, there's no basis for higher malware or security risk scores. Any suggestion otherwise would be speculative and unjustified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo reports make unwarranted assumptions; all conclude benignity based on the code's simplicity.\n\n6. **Score Consistency & Recommendations**  \nThe scores are consistent and appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security concerns)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** No changes needed; the current evaluations are appropriate.",
