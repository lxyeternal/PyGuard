  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the Python package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward version assignment with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, or data flows are present. The code is minimal, transparent, and free of any malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
