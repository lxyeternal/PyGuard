  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Standard OAuth flow for Blogger, with token storage and user authorization. No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads tokens, user input, environment variables; redirects, stores tokens.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder credentials, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a typical OAuth implementation with no malicious intent. Placeholders are a configuration issue, not a security flaw.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to placeholder credentials)\n\n**Assessment:** The score aligns with the report's findings. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Similar OAuth flow, token handling, and storage.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders for secrets, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth logic, no malicious behavior, just insecure placeholders.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (due to placeholders)\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the report; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Same OAuth process, with token management.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder credentials, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate OAuth handling, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.3 (slightly higher, but still low; justified by insecure placeholders)\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Standard OAuth for Blogger, token storage, and handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical OAuth implementation, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Flow:** OAuth flow, token handling, with placeholders.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth logic, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware scores:** All 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0.2, justified by placeholder credentials which could lead to misconfiguration if not replaced, but not a direct security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** I agree with 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is clear.\n- **Risk:** Given the placeholders, a risk score of around 0.2-0.3 is reasonable. The highest is 0.3 (Report 3), which is justified.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified. No significant security flaws or malicious intent are evident. The main concern is the use of placeholders for sensitive credentials, which should be replaced with secure, environment-managed secrets before deployment.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that in production, credentials are managed securely via environment variables or secret management systems, and avoid hardcoded secrets.",
