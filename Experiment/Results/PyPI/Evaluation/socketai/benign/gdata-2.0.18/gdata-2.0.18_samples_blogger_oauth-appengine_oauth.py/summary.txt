  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate OAuth client implementation with no malicious behavior. The only security concern is the use of placeholder credentials, which must be replaced before deployment. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting configuration hygiene rather than active vulnerability."
