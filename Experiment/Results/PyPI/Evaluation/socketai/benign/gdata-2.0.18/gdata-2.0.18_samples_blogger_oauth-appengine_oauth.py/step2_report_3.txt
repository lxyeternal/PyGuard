  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes a standard OAuth flow with token storage, redirection, and callback handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions placeholders for credentials, which is typical during development.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just standard OAuth implementation with placeholders.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct, no malware detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code appears clear.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — low, due to placeholder credentials.  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes OAuth process, token handling, and storage.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders again, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth client logic, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code appears transparent.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — due to placeholder secrets, acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align well with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Proper OAuth flow, with token management.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders for credentials, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate OAuth logic, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  - Risk: 0.3 — slightly higher, but justified given placeholder credentials.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct OAuth process description.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders for secrets, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct OAuth flow with token handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders for secrets, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical OAuth client, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — fitting.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — transparent code.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected; all reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero mainly due to placeholders for secrets, which is acceptable during development but should be replaced in production.\n- **Consistency:** All reports are consistent with the code's behavior and logic.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — due to placeholder credentials, which is a minor configuration concern, not a security flaw.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard OAuth implementation with no malicious intent. The scores given in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The main recommendation is to replace placeholder secrets with secure, environment-managed credentials before deployment.",
