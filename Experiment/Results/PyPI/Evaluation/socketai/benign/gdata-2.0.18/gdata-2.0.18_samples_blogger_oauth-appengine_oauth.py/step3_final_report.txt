{
  "purpose": "Implements OAuth authorization flow for Google Blogger API, managing request tokens, access tokens, user authorization, and token revocation.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings, user input from request URI, environment variables, and token store.",
  "sinks": "Redirects user to OAuth approval URL, stores tokens in database, sets OAuth tokens in the Blogger service, and redirects after callback or revocation.",
  "flows": "Request token fetched from OAuth provider → stored in database → user redirected for approval → callback exchanges request token for access token → stored in token store → user accesses protected resources.",
  "anomalies": "Contains placeholder credentials ('YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME', 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY', 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET') which are not malicious but insecure if left in production.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard OAuth 1.0 flow with proper token handling, storage, and revocation. No suspicious or malicious code detected. The placeholders for secrets are a configuration security concern but do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious network activity observed. The implementation appears correct and secure in logic, with the main risk being the insecure placeholders that should be replaced with environment-managed secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate OAuth client implementation with no malicious behavior. The only security concern is the use of placeholder credentials, which must be replaced before deployment. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting configuration hygiene rather than active vulnerability.",
