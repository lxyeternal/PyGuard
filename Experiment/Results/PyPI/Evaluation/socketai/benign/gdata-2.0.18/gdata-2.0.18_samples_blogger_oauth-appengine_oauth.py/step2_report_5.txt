  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes a standard OAuth flow with token storage, user redirects, and token exchange.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder credentials are present, but no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code follows typical OAuth patterns, securely manages tokens, and does not contain suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected; placeholders need secure replacement.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to placeholder credentials).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard OAuth, no malware, no obfuscation, minor security concern about placeholders.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar OAuth flow with token handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders for credentials, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OAuth logic, tokens stored securely, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just placeholders.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical OAuth client, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard OAuth with token storage and user redirects.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholders for credentials, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Proper OAuth flow, no malicious activity, tokens managed securely.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 (slightly higher, but still low).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is legitimate OAuth logic, placeholders are security concerns but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar OAuth process with token handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder credentials, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OAuth implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just placeholders.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical OAuth implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** OAuth flow with token storage and user redirects.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder credentials, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OAuth pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard OAuth logic.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0.0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which matches the code's readability.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, mainly due to placeholders for secrets, which are configuration issues rather than security flaws.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — placeholder credentials are a deployment concern but not an active vulnerability or attack vector.\n\n**Note:** The placeholder credentials should be replaced with secure, environment-managed secrets before deployment to eliminate the security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code implements a standard OAuth flow for Google Blogger API, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main concern is the use of placeholder secrets, which should be replaced securely. The risk scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
