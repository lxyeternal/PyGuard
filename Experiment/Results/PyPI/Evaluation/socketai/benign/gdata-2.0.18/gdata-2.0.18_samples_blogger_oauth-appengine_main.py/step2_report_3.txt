  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Blogger OAuth client, allowing viewing blogs and creating posts.\n- User inputs ('body' and 'id') are directly used in API calls without explicit sanitization or validation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n- The use of OAuth and third-party APIs appears standard.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence Confirmation\n\n**Input data ('body' and 'id') used directly in API calls and templates.**  \nWhile this is common in such applications, it does pose potential security risks, particularly **XSS** if the Blogger API or downstream clients do not sanitize content. However, the code itself does not perform sanitization.\n\n**Malware presence:**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, and no malicious behavior is detected or claimed.\n\n**Obfuscation:**  \nAll reports assign obfuscated score 0, which is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports\n\n- The reports correctly identify the flow of untrusted data into API calls and templates.\n- They note the absence of sanitization but do not claim this as an immediate vulnerability, only a potential concern.\n- The reasoning is consistent and cautious, not overestimating risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** No major logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting minimal concern about unvalidated user input.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nGiven the code's simplicity and the lack of evident malicious intent, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5)\n\n- The reports assign a security risk of 0.2–0.3, which is low but acknowledges potential issues with unvalidated input.\n- Since the code directly uses user input in API calls and rendering, **a risk score of 0.5 or higher could be justified if we consider potential XSS or injection vulnerabilities**.\n\n**However,** the code relies on the Blogger API, which likely sanitizes or handles content appropriately, and no evidence of exploitation or malicious payloads exists.\n\n**Therefore,** the current scores seem reasonable and cautious but not overstated.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Claims\n\n- All reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- They correctly avoid overestimating risk or malware.\n- The confidence levels (0.8–0.9) are appropriate, given the limited scope and the lack of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (as per reports), perhaps slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Considering the analysis, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (reflecting unvalidated user input but no active exploit or malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2               | Potential for injection/XSS due to lack of sanitization, but no active exploits or malicious activity observed. |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe but warrants caution regarding input validation.**",
