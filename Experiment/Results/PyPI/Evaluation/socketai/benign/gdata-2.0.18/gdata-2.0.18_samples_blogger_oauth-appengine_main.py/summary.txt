  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Blogger OAuth client with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the lack of input validation, but this is common in such applications and does not constitute malicious activity. The supply chain risk is low, and the overall malware score is 0. The risk score could be slightly increased if desired, but current scores are justified."
