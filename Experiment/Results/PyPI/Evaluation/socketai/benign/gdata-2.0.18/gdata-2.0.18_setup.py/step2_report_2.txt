  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same setup script for the 'gdata' Python package.\n- The code is a standard setup.py configuration, with no dynamic code, no external input, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code performs environment checks and calls setup() with static package data.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup script, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Same as above, consistent with prior assessments. No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Same conclusion: benign, standard setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a minimal security risk score (0.1), citing reliance on sys.version_info as a potential concern.\n\n**Justification for the slight concern:**  \nUsing sys.version_info is standard for compatibility checks. It is not an attack vector or malicious. The minimal security risk score (0.1) seems to be overly cautious, perhaps considering the version check as a minor potential for issues, but in practice, this is normal.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** **0** — no malicious code, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** **0** — all code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity, the overall risk should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no modifications needed.\n- The minimal security concern noted in report 5 is unwarranted; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0**     |\n\nThis setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no security issues.",
