  "purpose": "The script defines setup configuration for a Python package 'gdata', primarily to package and distribute a Google data API client library.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python runtime version via sys.version_info; loads standard modules sys and distutils.core; reads package metadata and list of sub-packages to include.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted input or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup procedures, with no unusual code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Python package setup using distutils. It checks Python version to conditionally append a dependency. It then calls setup() with package metadata and a list of packages. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used or manipulated. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden functions. The code strictly adheres to standard packaging practices without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations related to package distribution. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
