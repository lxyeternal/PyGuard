  "purpose": "Sample application demonstrating how to access and retrieve data from the Google Analytics Data Export API using Python.",
  "sources": "User input for Google Analytics Table ID via gdata.sample_util.get_param.",
  "sinks": "API request construction and execution via my_client.GetDataFeed, which sends requests to Google Analytics servers.",
  "flows": "User inputs table_id -> API query constructed with user-provided table_id -> request sent to Google Analytics API.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; proper use of API libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script uses official Google Data APIs and standard library calls for authorization and data retrieval. It prompts the user for a Google Analytics table ID, constructs an API query, and displays the data. No code executes external commands, writes to files, or includes obfuscated code. All data flows involve user input used to query a trusted API endpoint. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed, and the code's purpose is for data retrieval and display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate example for accessing Google Analytics data; it does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The data flow is straightforward, and there are no signs of security risks or backdoors.",
