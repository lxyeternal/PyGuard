  "purpose": "Demonstrates how to access and display Google Analytics data via the Data Export API using Python.",
  "sources": "User input for 'table_id' via gdata.sample_util.get_param().",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data; output functions print data directly to console. No data leakage or external transmission observed.",
  "flows": "User input ('table_id') flows into the DataFeedQuery object; data retrieved from Google Analytics API and printed; no further untrusted data flows or processing found.",
  "anomalies": "Uses user input for 'table_id' with no sanitization, but it's used in an API query, not executed as code; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a sample demonstration of Google Analytics API data retrieval. It initializes an API client with a specified app name, authenticates with user credentials, and prompts the user for a table ID. It then constructs an API query and fetches data. The code consists mainly of data retrieval and print functions. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network connections to suspicious domains. The user input is used for an API query parameter, which is standard and does not appear to be exploited maliciously. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present. Overall, the code appears benign, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sample for Google Analytics API access. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. It mainly reads user input for API querying and outputs data, with no evident security risks.",
