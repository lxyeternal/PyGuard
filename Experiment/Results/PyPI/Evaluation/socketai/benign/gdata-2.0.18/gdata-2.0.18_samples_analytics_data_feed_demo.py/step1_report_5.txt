  "purpose": "Sample application demonstrating how to make requests to the Google Analytics Data Export API and retrieve analytics data.",
  "sources": "User input for 'table_id' via gdata.sample_util.get_param",
  "sinks": "API call to my_client.GetDataFeed with constructed query parameters",
  "flows": "Input from user (table_id) -> Constructed data query -> API request via my_client.GetDataFeed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; the code relies on standard API authentication and user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard API authentication using the gdata library, prompts the user for a Google Analytics table ID, and constructs a data query with fixed parameters. The flow is straightforward: user input is used to build an API query which is then executed. No untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations beyond the input prompt, and no malicious or suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is evident. External library usage is standard for Google API interactions. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present. The script includes error handling for authentication issues, but no unsafe code execution or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate sample demonstrating Google Analytics API usage with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It relies on user input for the table ID and makes typical API calls without suspicious behaviors.",
