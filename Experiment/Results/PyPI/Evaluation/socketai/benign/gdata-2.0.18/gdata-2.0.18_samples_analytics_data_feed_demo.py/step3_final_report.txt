  "purpose": "Sample Python application demonstrating how to connect to Google Analytics Data Export API, retrieve data, and display various feed details.",
  "sources": "User input for 'table_id', API request parameters, data retrieved from Google Analytics API.",
  "sinks": "API request construction with user input, data display functions.",
  "flows": "User input ('table_id') used directly in API query parameters; data fetched from API; data processed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of unvalidated user input for 'table_id', but this is typical in sample code and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward sample for API access, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and API calls, with proper authorization routines. The only minor concern is the lack of input validation for 'table_id', which does not constitute a security threat in this context. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to input handling, which is acceptable for sample code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured sample demonstrating Google Analytics API usage. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The minor concern about input validation does not elevate the security risk significantly. Overall, it is safe for use and distribution as a sample.",
