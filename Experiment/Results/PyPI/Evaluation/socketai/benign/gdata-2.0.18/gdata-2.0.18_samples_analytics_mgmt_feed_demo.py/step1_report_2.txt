{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of Google Analytics Management API via Python client library to retrieve and print analytics data.",
  "sources": "User credentials prompt in 'authorize_client' function, API request parameters, and API responses.",
  "sinks": "Print statements display retrieved data; no data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "User inputs credentials -> Authorization flow -> API data retrieval -> Data printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded sensitive data beyond placeholder account IDs, no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes by importing Google Data APIs, prompts user for credentials to authorize access, then retrieves and displays Google Analytics management data. It uses standard API calls to fetch account, web property, profile, goal, and segment data. No network connections outside the Google APIs are made, nor is any data exfiltrated or processed insecurely. The code structure is straightforward, with clear separation of functions, and no signs of backdoors, hidden behavior, or malicious logic. It appears to be a legitimate demo script for Google Analytics API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate demo for Google Analytics API interactions, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It reads user credentials for API authorization and displays management data; all operations are within expected API usage patterns.",
