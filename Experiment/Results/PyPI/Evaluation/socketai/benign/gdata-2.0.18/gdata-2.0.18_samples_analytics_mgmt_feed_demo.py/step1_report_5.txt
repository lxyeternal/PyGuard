{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates how to retrieve data from the Google Analytics Management API using the Python client library.",
  "sources": "Reads credentials and user input during authorization; accesses Google Analytics API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output; no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Authorization credentials -> API requests -> printed outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of deprecated placeholders (~all) for IDs is typical for demo purposes; no obfuscated or malicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard demonstration of using Google's Analytics API client library. It handles authorization, fetches various management feeds, and prints the results. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations. The only potential concern is the use of placeholders (~all) for IDs, which could lead to unintended data access if used improperly, but this is typical in demo code. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code relies on external libraries and standard OAuth flows without any hidden or obfuscated components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate demo script for Google Analytics API usage, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use in its intended context, assuming proper authorization credentials are provided.",
