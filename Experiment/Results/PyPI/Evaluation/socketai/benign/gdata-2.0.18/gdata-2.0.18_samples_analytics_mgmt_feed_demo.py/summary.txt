  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign demo with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The observed behavior aligns with a safe, open-source API demonstration. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to handling potentially sensitive data in a demo context."
