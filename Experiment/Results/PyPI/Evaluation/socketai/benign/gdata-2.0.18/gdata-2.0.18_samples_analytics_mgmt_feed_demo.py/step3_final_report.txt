{
  "purpose": "A demonstration script for retrieving and printing Google Analytics management data via the Python gdata client library, prompting user credentials and making API calls to fetch account, web property, profile, goal, and segment information.",
  "sources": "User input prompts for credentials; API calls to Google Analytics Management API; placeholders (~all) for account IDs.",
  "sinks": "Printing retrieved data to stdout; no data exfiltration or network activity beyond API requests.",
  "flows": "User provides credentials -> API authentication -> API data retrieval -> data printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders (~all) for IDs, which is typical in demo scripts; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no suspicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, straightforward demo for Google Analytics API access, with proper exception handling and no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only retrieves and prints data, with no evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of deprecated libraries is a maintenance concern but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious intent is present. The placeholders for IDs are typical for demo purposes and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign demo with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The observed behavior aligns with a safe, open-source API demonstration. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), primarily due to handling potentially sensitive data in a demo context.",
