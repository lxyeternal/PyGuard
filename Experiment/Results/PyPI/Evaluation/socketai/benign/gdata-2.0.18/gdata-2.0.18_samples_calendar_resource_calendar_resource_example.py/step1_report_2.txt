{
  "purpose": "A sample application demonstrating the use of Google Calendar Resource API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting calendar resources via user input.",
  "sources": "User input via raw_input() for domain, email, password, resource_id, resource properties; getpass for password input.",
  "sinks": "Client API method calls (CreateResource, GetResource, UpdateResource, DeleteResource) which interact with external services; print statements for output.",
  "flows": "User inputs (domain, email, password, resource properties) flow into API method calls; sensitive data flows from input to API client calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw_input() and getpass for sensitive data collection; passwords are handled in plain text; no hardcoded credentials in code; no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward sample app that uses user input to manage calendar resources via the Google Calendar Resource API client. The input collection is basic, with no evident data validation or sanitization, but also no evidence of malicious input handling or injection risks. The code interacts with external APIs through well-defined client methods, and there are no suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It solely facilitates resource management, and all actions are user-driven. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are present. Overall, the script appears benign, intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign sample application for managing Google Calendar resources with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily relies on user input to operate and does not include any covert or harmful code segments.",
