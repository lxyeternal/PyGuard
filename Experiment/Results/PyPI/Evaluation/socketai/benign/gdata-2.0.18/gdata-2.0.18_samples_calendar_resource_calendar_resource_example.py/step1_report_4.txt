{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for managing Google Apps Calendar resources via the Calendar Resource API, allowing creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of resources.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user inputs from raw_input() for domain, email, password, resource_id, resource_name, resource_description, resource_type, and operation commands; getpass.getpass() for administrator password.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive data such as passwords and resource IDs are processed internally; no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows to external systems are evident.",
  "flows": "User inputs (credentials, resource details, commands) flow into API method calls (CreateResource, GetResource, UpdateResource, DeleteResource), but no untrusted data is sent over the network outside intended API requests.",
  "anomalies": "The script uses hardcoded prompts and input collection but does not contain obfuscated or unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. It relies on external API client for operations.",
  "analysis": "The code collects user credentials and resource details for API operations, which are passed directly to the gdata API client methods. There are no indications of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The password is entered via getpass, which is a standard secure practice. The code’s structure is straightforward command-line interaction for API management, with no suspicious code constructs or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard administrative tool for managing Google Calendar resources with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It does not include network communication outside API calls nor any hidden functionalities. Overall, the script appears safe.",
