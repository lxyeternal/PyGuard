  "purpose": "Sample application demonstrating the use of Google Calendar Resource API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting calendar resources.",
  "sources": "User input via raw_input() and getpass.getpass(), including domain, email, password, resource_id, resource_name, resource_description, resource_type.",
  "sinks": "Methods calling external API: self.client.ClientLogin(), self.client.CreateResource(), self.client.GetResource(), self.client.GetResourceFeed(), self.client.UpdateResource(), self.client.DeleteResource().",
  "flows": "User inputs (domain, email, password, resource properties) flow into API method calls via the CalendarResourceClient instance; no direct data leaks or untrusted data manipulation observed beyond intended API interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated Python 2.4 syntax; stores sensitive credentials in memory without encryption; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious obfuscated code or unusual control flow. The password input is obtained securely via getpass. No network connections or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with Google APIs through a client library, requiring user credentials. Inputs are collected via standard input methods without hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward API demo, with user-supplied credentials and resource data, with no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard API demo tool for managing calendar resources, collecting user input securely and performing API operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It employs typical patterns for command-line utilities with user interaction, and no security risks are apparent beyond the need for secure handling of credentials in actual deployment.",
