  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for managing Google Calendar resources via the gdata API, allowing creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of resources based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input via raw_input() and getpass.getpass() for credentials and resource data; API method calls to the CalendarResourceClient.",
  "sinks": "API method calls that send data to Google servers; no direct untrusted data sinks are present, but credentials are handled in memory.",
  "flows": "User inputs (credentials and resource info) flow into API calls through method parameters; no external data flows or network anomalies beyond API interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected; code is straightforward and uses standard API client methods.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple, user-interactive sample application for managing calendar resources. It collects credentials securely via getpass, performs API calls, and offers CRUD operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code is outdated (Python 2.4), but this does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to handling credentials in plain text and deprecated environment, but no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward sample for API interaction with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (~0.2) scores are justified based on its functionality and structure.",
