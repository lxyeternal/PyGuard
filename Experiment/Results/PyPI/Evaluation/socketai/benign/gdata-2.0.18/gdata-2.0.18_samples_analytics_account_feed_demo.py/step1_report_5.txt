  "purpose": "Sample application demonstrating how to retrieve and display Google Analytics account data using Google's Data Export API with Python.",
  "sources": "Reading client credentials, API responses, and account/feed data from Google Analytics API via gdata library.",
  "sinks": "Printing data to console; no direct data leak or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Authorization credentials are used to fetch data; data retrieved from API is processed and printed; no untrusted data is written to external locations or used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors present; uses standard Google API client library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Google Analytics API client with a specified source name. It performs authorization via a helper function and fetches account feed data. The retrieved data is then printed in various formats, including feed details, segments, custom variables, goals, and account entries. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The use of API credentials is handled through the library and a utility function, which appears standard. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent is detected. The code functions as a sample API client with no security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sample for accessing and displaying Google Analytics data using the gdata library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is educational and demonstrative, with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
