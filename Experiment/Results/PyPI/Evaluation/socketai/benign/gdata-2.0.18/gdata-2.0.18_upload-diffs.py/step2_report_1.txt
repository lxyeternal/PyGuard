  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and determine the accuracy of their assessments, especially regarding malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a tool for uploading diffs, supporting multiple VCS, with user prompts, network requests, and file handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no malicious behavior, standard use of libraries, no signs of code injection or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, given the context).\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is an open-source utility for code review uploads. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the script's support for multiple VCS, user prompts, and network communication.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, no backdoors, standard network and file I/O, legitimate purpose.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a legitimate open-source tool with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a comprehensive description of the script's purpose, sources, sinks, and data flows.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious network domains, no hardcoded secrets, standard libraries, and practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code appears legitimate, with minimal security risk, typical for such tools.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on the script's functions and data flows.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads. Use of deprecated modules is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The script's functionality aligns with legitimate code review automation.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- **Assessment:** No meaningful information to evaluate. No code, no analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The provided code is a real, open-source script for uploading diffs to a code review system.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or techniques.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; standard network and file operations, user prompts, and external command executions.\n\n### **Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — The code is a legitimate utility with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, well-structured, and understandable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — Minor concerns about deprecated modules and subprocess execution, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, open-source, legitimate tool for code review uploads, with no malware or malicious intent detected. The low security risk reflects typical concerns with subprocess and network operations but does not indicate any real threat.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to deprecated modules and subprocess usage, but these are not malicious)",
