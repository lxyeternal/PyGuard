  "purpose": "A command-line utility to control Scalene profiling by sending signals to a specified process ID to turn profiling on or off.",
  "sources": "User-provided process ID via --pid argument.",
  "sinks": "os.kill() function used to send signals to the target process ID.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows into os.kill() to send either start or stop profiling signals to the specified process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward script that parses command-line arguments to determine a process ID and whether to turn profiling on or off. It then sends the appropriate signal using os.kill() with signals obtained from ScaleneSignals(). Error handling for process lookup errors is present. The script does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. It relies on user input and standard process signaling, which is typical for such utilities. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The signals are used for profiling control, a legitimate purpose. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for controlling profiling via signals. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The potential security risk is minimal and primarily depends on user misuse, such as signaling unintended processes. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting the inherent risk in process signaling tools.",
