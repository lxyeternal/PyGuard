  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for controlling profiling via signals. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The potential security risk is minimal and primarily depends on user misuse, such as signaling unintended processes. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting the inherent risk in process signaling tools."
