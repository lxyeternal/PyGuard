  "purpose": "This script manages turning Scalene profiling on or off for a specific process by sending signals.",
  "sources": "User-provided process ID via command-line argument (--pid)",
  "sinks": "os.kill() function which sends signals to specified process IDs",
  "flows": "User input (--pid, --on, --off) -> argument parsing -> os.kill() with ScaleneSignals -> process receiving signals",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard usage of signal sending based on user input, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to identify the target process and whether to turn profiling on or off. It uses the ScaleneSignals class to retrieve specific signals for starting/stopping profiling. It then sends these signals to the specified process ID using os.kill(). Error handling is limited to catching ProcessLookupError. The script's behavior is straightforward and appears to be for legitimate profiling control. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present, and no suspicious external communications or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard profiling control script that safely manages profiling signals for processes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
