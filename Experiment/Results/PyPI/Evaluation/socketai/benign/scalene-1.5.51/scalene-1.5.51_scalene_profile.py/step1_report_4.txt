{
  "purpose": "The script manages starting and stopping profiling on a specified process using Scalene signals.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line arguments provided by the user, particularly the process ID and flags for profiling on/off.",
  "sinks": "The script sends signals to another process via os.kill, which could affect process behavior but is controlled via parameters.",
  "flows": "User inputs (PID and profiling commands) -> parsing -> signaling process via os.kill -> process responds to signal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Uses standard libraries and well-defined modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line utility that controls profiling on another process via signals. It validates inputs, handles errors, and performs process signaling. It does not perform any data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious actions. There are no indications of hidden backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The use of ScaleneSignals and process signaling is standard for process control tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for controlling profiling features of a process, with no malicious intent detected. It leverages standard Python modules and does not exhibit suspicious or malicious behavior.",
