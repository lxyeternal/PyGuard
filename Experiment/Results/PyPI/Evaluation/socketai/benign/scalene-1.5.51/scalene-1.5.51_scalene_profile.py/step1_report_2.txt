  "purpose": "This script manages turning Scalene profiling on or off for a specific process by sending signals.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (--pid, --on, --off) and process ID.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.kill to send signals to a process based on provided PID.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argument parsing -> os.kill with ScaleneSignals -> process receives profiling signal",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code. The use of signals is standard for process control. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily parses command-line arguments to identify a process ID and whether to turn profiling on or off. It then uses os.kill to send a specific signal defined in ScaleneSignals to control profiling. The logic is straightforward and employs standard libraries without suspicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is evident. It relies on signals for process control, a typical pattern in Unix-like systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for controlling Scalene profiler status on a process. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It simply interacts with system signals based on user input.",
