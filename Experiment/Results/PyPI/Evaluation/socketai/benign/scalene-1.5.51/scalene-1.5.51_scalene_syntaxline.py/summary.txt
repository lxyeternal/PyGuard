  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for rendering syntax lines with the rich library. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
