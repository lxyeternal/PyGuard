{
  "purpose": "A class to manage a timer that can handle a different frequency than the main Scalene timer, allowing setting, resetting, and tracking elapsed time.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data read from external sources or untrusted inputs within this code).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data is output or used to influence system behavior).",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code does not process untrusted input to influence output or system state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The class provides standard timer functionalities without unusual code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a timer class with methods to set, reset, and query timer states. It updates internal timing counters based on elapsed time, and signals when timers are complete. The implementation appears straightforward, with no external input parsing, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple timer class without any suspicious or malicious behaviors. It is a benign utility class for timing purposes, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
