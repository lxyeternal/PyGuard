{
  "purpose": "A class that manages a timer with adjustable seconds and interval settings, likely for timing or scheduling purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to set_itimer (seconds, interval), method calls to set or reset the timer, elapsed time provided to yield_next_delay.",
  "sinks": "Return values from yield_next_delay indicating whether the timer is done and the next delay interval.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (seconds, interval) -> set_itimer -> get_itimer -> yield_next_delay -> output is_done and next delay.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of insecure functions or obfuscated code. No network or file I/O observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a timer class with methods to set, reset, and query timer status. It manages internal state variables for seconds and intervals, updating them based on elapsed time. The flow is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or external interactions. The class appears to be a standard timer implementation with clear control flow, proper state management, and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard timer utility without malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data handling, or security risks. It is a benign implementation for managing timing events within a larger system.",
