  "purpose": "A timer utility class managing internal timing states for scheduling or delay purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to set_itimer (seconds, interval), elapsed time input to yield_next_delay.",
  "sinks": "Return values from get_itimer, yield_next_delay (status flags and remaining time).",
  "flows": "set_itimer initializes internal state -> yield_next_delay updates remaining time based on elapsed -> returns whether timer has elapsed and next delay.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured timer class with methods to set, reset, and query timer states. It does not perform any external data access, network activity, or cryptographic operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The logic is consistent, with no logical flaws or vulnerabilities. The scores across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report is overly cautious given the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is a benign utility with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward timer utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety. The minimal security risk score (0.1) can be lowered to 0 for consistency. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0. All evidence supports a final malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.",
