{
  "purpose": "A class to manage a timer with adjustable intervals, likely used for timing or scheduling purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'seconds' and 'interval' in set_itimer method, and the 'elapsed' argument in yield_next_delay method.",
  "sinks": "Return values from get_itimer, yield_next_delay, and internal state modifications. No external system calls or data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' and 'interval' flow into internal state; 'elapsed' flows into remaining_seconds and remaining_interval updates; outputs are boolean flags and remaining time values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, no external data fetches, no code obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The class manages internal timer states with standard methods to set, reset, and query timers. The methods manipulate internal floats and booleans in a straightforward manner, with no external system interactions or cryptic behavior. The logic for decrementing remaining time and resetting intervals is typical for timer implementations. No indications of malicious intent or covert data handling are present. The code appears clean, purposeful, and free of malicious or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard timer management class with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs straightforward timing functions without any suspicious features.",
