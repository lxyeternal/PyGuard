  "purpose": "A class to manage a timer that operates at a different frequency than the main Scalene timer, allowing for timing control and delays.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to set_itimer method (seconds, interval), internal state variables (seconds, interval, remaining_seconds, remaining_interval, delay_elapsed, is_set).",
  "sinks": "Returns from get_itimer and yield_next_delay methods, internal state modifications.",
  "flows": "set_itimer inputs modify internal state; yield_next_delay reads elapsed time and updates remaining times, potentially resetting delay states.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present. The code is straightforward and appears to be timer management logic.",
  "analysis": "The class manages timing intervals and delays with clear methods for setting, resetting, and querying timer state. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious behavior detected. The logic strictly pertains to timer state management without side effects or external data flows. There are no indications of malicious code or backdoors; it functions as a utility class for timing control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a timer utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe, intended solely for managing timing delays within a larger application. No security risks or malware behavior identified.",
