{
  "purpose": "The code implements a class 'Adaptive' for sampling and averaging data points, likely for statistical or data processing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it operates solely on internal data structures and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data affects external systems, no data leaks, or system modifications; the code only manipulates internal lists.",
  "flows": "Data flows within the class methods: 'add' updates internal sample array, 'get' retrieves it, and operator overloads combine or modify internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The class maintains a sample array and allows addition of new values, decimating (reducing and smoothing data) when full. Operator overloading provides ways to combine samples. No external data sources or sinks are present. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or privacy violations are detected. The code appears to serve a statistical sampling purpose with straightforward implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a sampling class with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is safe and focused solely on internal data processing.",
