{
  "purpose": "Implements a sampling data structure for maintaining a uniform-like sample over a fixed size, with methods for combining and modifying samples.",
  "sources": "Input data is added via the add() method, which takes float values and updates the internal sample array.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data into system effects or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into add() method, updating the sample_array; then possibly combined with other Adaptive instances via __add__ or __iadd__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors such as hidden network calls, data leaks, or code injections. No hardcoded credentials or external dependencies. The class appears to be purely computational.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for statistical sampling with methods for combining instances and adding values to samples. The add() method manages internal array updates and performs decimation by median filtering when the array is full. No external data inputs, network calls, or system modifications are present. The operations are purely mathematical, with no signs of malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a sampling mechanism for internal data analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manages internal data without external communication or sensitive data handling.",
