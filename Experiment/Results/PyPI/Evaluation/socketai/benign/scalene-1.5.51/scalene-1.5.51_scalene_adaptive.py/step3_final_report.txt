{
  "purpose": "Implements an adaptive sampling data structure with median-based decimation to manage sample size.",
  "sources": "The 'add' method reads input values; internal list manipulations during decimation and merging.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network outputs; internal data only.",
  "flows": "Input values flow into 'add', potentially trigger decimation, and update 'sample_array'. Merging flows combine sample arrays.",
  "anomalies": "The decimation process replaces the first third of the array with medians of triplets, which may cause data loss or inconsistency over multiple decimations; no external secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an adaptive sampling structure with median filtering for size reduction. No external dependencies, network activity, or data leaks are present. The decimation process is standard and not suspicious. The methods operate internally with safe data handling. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, computational nature of the code. Minor logical concerns about potential data loss during repeated decimations do not impact security assessment. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a benign, internal data management utility performing statistical sampling with median filtering. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
