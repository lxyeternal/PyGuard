{
  "purpose": "Implements a sampling mechanism to produce a uniform random sample effect, with support for combining and manipulating sample data.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads; internal state is initialized in constructor and modified through method calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks; methods modify internal arrays but do not handle untrusted external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; internal data management is contained within the class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and standard for sampling purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for adaptive sampling with methods for adding values, combining instances, and retrieving data. It uses standard list operations, sorting for median calculation during decimation, and typical Python constructs. There are no network operations, file I/O, or external dependencies. The logic is consistent and intended for sampling and statistical processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a sampling data structure with no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It is a standard utility class with no suspicious features.",
