      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard practices for cross-platform compilation and packaging. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the nature of build scripts involving subprocesses and environment modifications."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate profiling enhancement that replaces threading.Lock with a custom class to monitor thread sleep states. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects the potential system impact of overriding a core threading component but does not indicate malicious activity. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign purpose for performance profiling."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured profiling and leak detection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with its functionality. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected, and the code poses no security threat."

It is a benign, internal data management utility performing statistical sampling with median filtering. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk."

The potential security risk is minimal and primarily depends on user misuse, such as signaling unintended processes. The scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) reflecting the inherent risk in process signaling tools."
