{
  "purpose": "The script checks if it is running as root; if not, it attempts to rerun itself with sudo. Once elevated, it initializes NVIDIA's NVML library, retrieves all GPU devices, and sets persistence and accounting modes for each GPU.",
  "sources": "os.geteuid() for privilege check; subprocess.check_call(['sudo', sys.executable] + sys.argv) for privilege escalation; pynvml functions for GPU info and configuration.",
  "sinks": "subprocess call with 'sudo' as a potential sink if misused; no other untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Privilege check via os.geteuid() -> rerun with sudo if needed -> initialize pynvml -> get GPU handles -> set modes -> shutdown pynvml.",
  "anomalies": "Use of privilege escalation pattern (rerunning with sudo) is common but can be risky if the script is modified maliciously; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate GPU configuration tasks with proper error handling and cleanup. The privilege escalation pattern is standard for system management scripts but should be reviewed in supply chain contexts. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3) due to privilege escalation but justified given the script's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign GPU management utility with a common privilege escalation pattern. No malware or obfuscation detected. The low risk score reflects the privilege escalation method, which is typical in administrative scripts. Overall, it appears safe for deployment in controlled environments.",
