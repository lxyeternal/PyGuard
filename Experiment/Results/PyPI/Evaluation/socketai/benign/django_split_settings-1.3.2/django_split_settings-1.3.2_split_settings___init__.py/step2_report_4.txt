  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. All reports are purely descriptive comments or documentation about organizing Django settings into multiple files and directories. There is no executable code, no data processing, no input/output operations, and no references to sensitive data or external sources.\n\n2. The analysis in each report correctly identifies that these are benign comments with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence levels are all high (1), which is appropriate given the nature of the content.\n\n3. The malware score in each report is 0, which aligns with the fact that these are just documentation comments. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden behavior, or obfuscation.\n\n4. The security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent with the content being purely informational and non-executable.\n\n5. Since the reports are consistent in their assessment and there are no discrepancies or signs of malicious activity, I see no reason to adjust any scores.\n\n6. The core issue is that the reports are all describing the same benign scenario: documentation comments for project organization. They do not contain any code or data that could be exploited.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reported issues are not actual issues; they are benign comments.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the fact that the content is purely informational with no security concerns.",
