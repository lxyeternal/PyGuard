  "sinks": "No data input/output, no external data sources, no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A – no executable code or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, no suspicious or malicious patterns, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "All reports are purely descriptive comments regarding project organization. There are no executable scripts, data processing, or external interactions. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, informational nature of the content. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The high confidence in benign assessment is justified given the lack of code or data flow. The content poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation with no executable or malicious components. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture remains unaffected by these comments.",
