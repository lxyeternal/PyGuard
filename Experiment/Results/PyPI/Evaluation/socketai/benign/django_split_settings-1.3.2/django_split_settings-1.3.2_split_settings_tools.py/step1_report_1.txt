  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for including and managing multiple Django settings files, allowing flexible configuration through optional and wildcard patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths from function arguments, the caller's globals, and the filesystem using glob patterns.",
  "sinks": "Executes contents of included files with `exec()`, potentially running untrusted code if the included files are malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "File paths from args are matched via glob; files are opened and read, then executed with `exec()` within a provided scope; files are also added to sys.modules for reload support.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `exec()` to run arbitrary code from files; dynamic creation and execution of code from filesystem without validation; manipulation of sys.modules for module reload; no validation or sanitization of included files.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically includes configuration files based on provided patterns, reads and executes their contents, and manipulates modules for Django settings management. The use of `exec()` on file content is a significant security concern, as it allows arbitrary code execution if any included file is malicious or compromised. The handling of optional files and glob patterns provides flexibility but increases the risk if untrusted files are present. The code also modifies sys.modules for reloading, which could potentially be exploited to execute malicious code upon reloads. There are no security measures such as validation, sandboxing, or content checks before executing files. Overall, the primary risk stems from executing external files without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script enables flexible inclusion of settings files but poses a significant security risk due to its use of `exec()` on file contents without validation or sanitization. If malicious files are present, they could execute arbitrary code, leading to potential compromise of the environment. The code should incorporate validation of included files or avoid using `exec()` on untrusted content.",
