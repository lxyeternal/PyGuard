  "conclusion": "The code pattern allows for dynamic inclusion of external files via glob patterns, compiling and executing their contents without validation. This creates a high security risk, as malicious files could execute arbitrary code. The malware potential score should be high, around 0.8, reflecting the risk of malicious code execution. The overall security risk score should be approximately 0.85. No obfuscation is present. Environments using this pattern should implement validation, sandboxing, or avoid executing untrusted files to mitigate risks."
