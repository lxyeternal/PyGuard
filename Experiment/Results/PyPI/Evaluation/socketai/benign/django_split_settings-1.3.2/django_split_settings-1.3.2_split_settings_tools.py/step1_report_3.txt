{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for organizing and including multiple Django settings files, allowing flexible and modular configuration management.",
  "sources": "User inputs via function arguments (`args`), environment variables, and scope variables like `sys._getframe(1).f_globals` and `scope['__file__']`.",
  "sinks": "File operations (open, read, compile), dynamic execution of code (`exec`), and manipulation of `sys.modules` to add modules dynamically.",
  "flows": "Inputs from `args` and scope are used to locate files via glob patterns, which are then opened, compiled, and executed within the given scope; included files are registered in `sys.modules`.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `exec()` to run code read from files, dynamic module creation and insertion into `sys.modules`, potential reliance on filename patterns, no validation of file contents before execution, and manipulation of internal scope variables without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically includes and executes external Python files based on glob patterns, which can be manipulated or crafted to include malicious code. The use of `exec()` on file contents is a significant security concern, especially since it allows arbitrary code execution. While the code aims to facilitate modular settings management, the absence of content validation or restrictions means that malicious code could be introduced via included files. The dynamic module creation and insertion into `sys.modules` further increase risk by allowing hidden or backdoor modules. There is no explicit security check or sandboxing around the included files, making this potentially dangerous if used with untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "This code has a high security risk primarily due to the use of `exec()` on files that can be controlled or manipulated by an attacker. The pattern of dynamically loading and executing code from files matching glob patterns without validation or sandboxing could lead to remote code execution if malicious files are included. The overall security risk score is high, especially if used with untrusted or misconfigured file patterns. It is important to restrict the inclusion to trusted files and consider safer alternatives.",
