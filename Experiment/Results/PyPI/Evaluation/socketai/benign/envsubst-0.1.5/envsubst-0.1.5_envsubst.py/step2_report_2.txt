  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code performs environment variable substitution, supporting simple ($VAR) and extended (${VAR:-default}) syntax.\n- It reads input from stdin or a file, processes substitutions, and outputs the result.\n- No network activity, file modifications beyond reading input, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The code uses standard regex patterns and environment access methods.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code features are evident.\n- The license and comments are standard, with no malicious hints.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Clear, straightforward substitution utility.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Completely benign, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, detailed and consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, likely due to the inherent risk of environment variable manipulation)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior. The slight security risk score is justified because environment variables can influence program behavior, but the code itself isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Similar findings; consistent with previous reports.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (same reasoning)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, standard utility.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Same conclusion: benign environment variable substitution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Same as above, straightforward and safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently show 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the potential for environment variables to influence behavior, but the code itself isn't malicious.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — inherent risk in environment variable handling, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard environment variable substitution utility with no malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects the potential impact of environment variables influencing behavior, but not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. No adjustments needed.",
