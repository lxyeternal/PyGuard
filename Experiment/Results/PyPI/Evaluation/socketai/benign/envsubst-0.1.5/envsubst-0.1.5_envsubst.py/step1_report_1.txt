{
  "purpose": "The code substitutes environment variables within strings, supporting simple and bracketed syntax with defaults.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from stdin or a specified file; accessing environment variables via os.environ; reading command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable resolution (os.environ.get), reading command-line arguments, and reading input data from files or stdin.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from a file or stdin, then passed through envsubst which replaces variable placeholders with environment variable values or command-line argument values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward environment variable substitution without obfuscation or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The script loads environment variables and command-line arguments to replace placeholders in strings. It handles default values and optional defaults in environment variable syntax. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The code is well-structured, standard for environment variable substitution, and does not contain suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs safe environment variable substitution without any malicious intent or malicious code segments. It is a benign utility script for variable expansion, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
