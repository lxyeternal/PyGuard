  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs environment variable substitution supporting various syntax forms.\n- No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are detected across all reports.\n- The code relies on standard libraries, regex, environment variables, and command-line arguments.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The logic is straightforward and typical for such utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports confirm the code's benign nature and correctness.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** None identified. The code correctly handles default values, optional defaults, and variable substitution.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0 to 0.1), consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or system calls beyond reading input.\n- It does not contain obfuscated code or dynamic execution.\n- The substitution logic is standard, using regex and environment variables.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on actual code behavior.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The second report assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which is slightly higher but still very low. Given the code's nature, this is acceptable and reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), aligning with the clear benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, the scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.** There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond trivial concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, standard environment variable substitution utility with no malicious or suspicious features.",
