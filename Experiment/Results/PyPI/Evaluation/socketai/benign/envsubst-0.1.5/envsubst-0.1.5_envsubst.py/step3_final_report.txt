  "purpose": "A utility to substitute environment variables within a string, supporting simple ($VAR) and extended (${VAR:-default}) syntax.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from stdin or a specified file; accesses environment variables via os.environ; reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the processed string to stdout; no data leaks or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into envsubst; regex matches identify variable patterns; _resolve_var retrieves variable values; replacements are made; final string is output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward environment variable substitution using regex patterns. It handles default values and optional defaults correctly. It reads input from stdin or a file, processes substitutions, and outputs the result. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The logic is standard and secure for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment variable substitution utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to environment variable handling, which is typical for such utilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the malware score is appropriately zero. The security risk score could be slightly above zero due to environment variable influence but remains very low.",
