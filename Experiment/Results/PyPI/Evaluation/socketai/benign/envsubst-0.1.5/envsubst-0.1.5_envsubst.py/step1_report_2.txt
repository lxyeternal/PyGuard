{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to substitute environment variables in strings, supporting various syntax forms for variable expansion and defaults.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from stdin or a file specified as a command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "The environment variables retrieved by _resolve_var, used in string substitution; the data written to stdout after substitution.",
  "flows": "Input data read from stdin or file -> processed by envsubst function -> environment variables accessed during substitution -> output written to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. The code does not perform network operations, file system modifications beyond reading input, or other malicious activities. It properly handles environment variables and defaults. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No use of eval or dynamic code execution. The license and comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script provides environment variable substitution with support for default values and optional conditions. It uses regular expressions to identify variable patterns and fetches their values from environment variables or command-line arguments. No suspicious code paths, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors such as network connections or system modifications are present. The code is straightforward, clean, and purpose-specific. It reads data, applies substitution, and outputs the result, all within expected safe boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment variable substitution utility without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It does not contain backdoors, network activity, or data theft mechanisms. The code appears safe for use and is designed solely for string processing tasks.",
