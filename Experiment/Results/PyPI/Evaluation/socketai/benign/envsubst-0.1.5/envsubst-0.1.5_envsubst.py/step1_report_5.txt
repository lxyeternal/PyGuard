{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to substitute environment variables within a string, supporting simple and bracketed syntax with default values.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ.get() and command-line arguments accessed via sys.argv; input data read from stdin or a file specified as an argument.",
  "sinks": "The data read from input is processed and output to stdout after substitution; environment variables are retrieved from the environment or command-line arguments, but no external system calls or network activities are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (from stdin or file) flows into envsubst() which performs regex-based substitutions using environment variables and command-line arguments, then outputs the substituted string.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads detected. The code performs standard environment variable substitution. No suspicious network or system modification activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code properly handles environment variable substitution with support for default values and different syntax forms. It reads input data from files or stdin, performs regex substitutions to replace variable placeholders with actual environment or command-line values, and outputs the result. All operations are benign and related solely to string processing and environment access. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward implementation of environment variable substitution with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a utility script for string processing. No malware or malicious behavior is present.",
