      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment variable substitution utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to environment variable handling, which is typical for such utilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the malware score is appropriately zero. The security risk score could be slightly above zero due to environment variable influence but remains very low."
