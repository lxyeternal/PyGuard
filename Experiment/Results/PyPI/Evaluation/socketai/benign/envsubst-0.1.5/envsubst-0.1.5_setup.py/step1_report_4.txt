  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'envsubst' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' -> setting package parameters -> defining console script entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py pattern. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads a README file for description, and specifies package metadata. The 'entry_points' define a console script that calls 'envsubst:main'. There are no code execution, input handling, or network operations within this script. The setup configuration is straightforward and typical for Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. All code appears to serve the purpose of package configuration only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The setup is typical, and there are no anomalies or potential attack vectors in this code.",
