  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'envsubst' Python package, intended to facilitate environment variable substitution in strings.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> uses data for package metadata; no flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools for package setup, reading a local README file for long description, and configuring package metadata and entry points. There are no external data inputs other than the file read, and no code execution, network communication, or dynamic behavior detected. No suspicious or malicious activity is present; it appears to be a typical, well-structured setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
