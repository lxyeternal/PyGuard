{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python project named 'envsubst' that substitutes environment variables in strings.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description, package metadata, and entry point declaration for console script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present; setup configuration does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "File read for long description -> setup configuration -> registration of console script entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' to configure package installation. It reads a README file for long description, then defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, license, modules, and entry points. The 'entry_points' specify a console script 'envsubst' that maps to the 'main' function within the 'envsubst' module. The code appears to be straightforward package setup without any embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. It performs standard setup operations typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution and defines a command-line interface.",
