  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging the 'envsubst' Python module, defining metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description; static package metadata; 'envsubst' module and 'main' function for CLI.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading static README file; defining static package info; CLI entry point referencing 'envsubst:main'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The setup references a module 'envsubst' and a 'main' function, but without malicious patterns or external data handling. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
