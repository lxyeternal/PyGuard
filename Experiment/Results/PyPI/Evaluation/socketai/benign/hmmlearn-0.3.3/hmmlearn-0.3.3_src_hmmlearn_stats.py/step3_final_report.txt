  "purpose": "Compute the log probability density of data points under multivariate Gaussian distributions with various covariance structures.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: X (data points), means (mean vectors), covars (covariance parameters).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; calculations are internal and purely mathematical.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through covariance handling functions to the final log-density computation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Gaussian density calculations supporting multiple covariance types, with appropriate numerical safeguards such as replacing zeros with tiny values and exception handling during Cholesky decomposition. It uses well-known libraries (numpy, scipy.linalg) and handles potential numerical issues correctly. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions are logically structured, and the purpose aligns with statistical modeling tasks. The consistent high confidence in benign intent and the absence of suspicious features justify low malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented utility for multivariate Gaussian density calculations. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
