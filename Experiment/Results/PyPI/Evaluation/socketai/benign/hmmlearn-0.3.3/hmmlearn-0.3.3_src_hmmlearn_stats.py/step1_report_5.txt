  "purpose": "This code computes the log density of multivariate Gaussian distributions for various covariance types, likely used for probabilistic modeling or clustering (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models).",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays: X (data points), means (mean vectors), covars (covariance matrices or parameters). No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Returns array of log probabilities; no data sinks or output to external systems are directly observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (X, means, covars) flow through various functions to produce log density outputs, primarily within _log_multivariate_normal_density_* functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated patterns. The code uses standard numerical libraries (numpy, scipy). No hidden or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically computes log densities for multivariate normal distributions across different covariance types, with appropriate numerical safeguards (e.g., minimum covariance). It uses standard library functions (numpy, scipy.linalg) for linear algebra. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The functions are typical for statistical computations. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are found. The code appears to be well-structured, and all data flows are predictable and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for calculating Gaussian log densities, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears to be legitimate scientific or machine learning code without malicious behavior.",
