  "purpose": "The code computes the log probability density of data points under various multivariate Gaussian models for statistical analysis or clustering tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data X, means, and covariances provided as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (X, means, covars) into density calculation functions, with internal transformations and mathematical operations, but no external output or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard numpy/scipy functions for mathematical computations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for computing log-density of multivariate normal distributions with different covariance types. It employs numpy for numerical operations and scipy.linalg for matrix decompositions. The functions include safeguards against degenerate covariance matrices, such as replacing zeros with small positive values and handling exceptions during Cholesky decompositions. No external network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The logic is consistent with statistical computations, and no suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of Gaussian density calculations for machine learning purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The functions are straightforward and utilize well-known libraries for numerical stability. Therefore, the code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
