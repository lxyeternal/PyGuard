{
  "purpose": "The code computes the log probability densities of data points under various multivariate Gaussian distributions, supporting different covariance structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the parameters X, means, and covars, which are passed as arguments to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical computations and does not write data to external sources or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, means, covars) flows into density calculation functions, which process and return log probability arrays; no external data output or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard libraries (numpy, scipy) and conventional calculations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical functions for multivariate normal density calculations, with proper handling of different covariance types. All functions utilize well-known linear algebra routines and numerical safeguards, such as replacing zeros in covariance matrices with small positive values and handling potential numerical issues with Cholesky decomposition. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or covert data leakage are present. The code appears to be a legitimate statistical utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of multivariate Gaussian density computations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical mathematical utility module with no suspicious features.",
