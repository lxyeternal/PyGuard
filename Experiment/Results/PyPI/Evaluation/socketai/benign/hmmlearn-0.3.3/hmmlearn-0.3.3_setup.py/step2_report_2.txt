  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward setup script for building a Python extension module using pybind11.\n- It imports necessary modules, specifies a C++ source file, and calls `setup()`.\n- No untrusted data inputs, external network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The source file `ext/_hmmc.cpp` is static and presumably trusted unless proven otherwise.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence:\n\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code.\n- No discrepancies in the source files, import statements, or setup parameters.\n- The logic and flow are consistent across reports.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n\n- No errors or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning is consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n- No claims of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are made.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it include obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The only potential concern could be the compilation of arbitrary C++ code, but this alone isn't malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score remains **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard patterns.\n- No obfuscation or hidden logic is present.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score remains **0**.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0.\n- No untrusted data, external inputs, or network activity.\n- The build process is standard and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** Security risk score remains **0**.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the code is purely a build configuration.\n- The scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script for building a C++ extension module with pybind11. It involves no dynamic code execution, no external data, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
