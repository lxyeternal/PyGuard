  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for building a Python extension module using pybind11 and setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pybind11.setup_helpers and setuptools; setup() function with ext_modules parameter.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable area is the compilation of '_hmmc.cpp' into a Python extension module; however, no direct data input or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flow; the code simply compiles a C++ extension as part of the package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard build procedures without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package extension module using pybind11. It imports necessary build helpers and setuptools, then calls setup() to specify a C++ extension module. There are no sources of untrusted data, no code execution beyond standard build procedures, and no suspicious or malicious patterns detected. The code appears legitimate and typical for building C++ extensions in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward build configuration for a Python extension module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
