  "purpose": "Set up a Python package extension module using pybind11 to compile C++ code.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pybind11.setup_helpers and setuptools; setup() function with ext_modules listing the C++ source file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no dangerous data handling or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Importing setup helpers -> configuring ext_modules with C++ source -> calling setup() to compile extension.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns. Standard usage of pybind11 for extension building.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for building a Python extension with C++. It specifies the C++ source file and the C++ standard version. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The code performs a typical setup for a C++ extension module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python C++ extension module using pybind11. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
