  "sources": "Imports from pybind11.setup_helpers and setuptools; static C++ source file ext/_hmmc.cpp.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Build configuration data flows from source code to compilation process; no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script for compiling a C++ extension with pybind11. It involves no dynamic code, no data input/output, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's purpose is solely to configure the build process, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard build configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its purpose.",
