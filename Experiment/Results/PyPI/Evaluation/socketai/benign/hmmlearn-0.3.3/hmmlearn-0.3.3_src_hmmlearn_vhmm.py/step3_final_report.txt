  "purpose": "Implementation of Variational Hidden Markov Models with categorical and Gaussian emissions, performing Bayesian updates, likelihood calculations, and model validation.",
  "sources": "Input data matrices 'X' and 'lengths', internal attributes for priors, posteriors, and parameters during initialization, likelihood, and update steps.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file I/O; all data processing is internal within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'X' and 'lengths' through likelihood computations, divergence calculations, and parameter updates within class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Use of standard linear algebra functions (np.linalg.inv) is typical but could be risky if inputs are malicious, though this is standard in statistical modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard variational inference procedures for HMMs, including parameter initialization, likelihood calculations, and Bayesian updates. It uses well-known libraries and mathematical functions consistent with statistical modeling. No external network activity, code obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of matrix inversion is typical but warrants caution if inputs are maliciously crafted, yet it remains a common practice in such models. Validation functions check parameter shapes and values appropriately. The divergence calculations and likelihood functions follow established formulas. Overall, the code appears legitimate, complex but standard, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of Variational HMMs with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (0.1) are justified based on the analysis. The code does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
