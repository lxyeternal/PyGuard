{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data normalization and covariance matrix shaping in statistical or machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'a' in normalize and log_normalize functions; 'covars' in fill_covars function.",
  "sinks": "In-place modifications of input arrays; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Source arrays are normalized or reshaped directly; no external data flows or untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; safeguards against division by zero are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard normalization functions and covariance matrix shaping routines using numpy and scipy. All functions perform typical operations with appropriate safeguards. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and align with common statistical processing practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard utility code for statistical data processing. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
