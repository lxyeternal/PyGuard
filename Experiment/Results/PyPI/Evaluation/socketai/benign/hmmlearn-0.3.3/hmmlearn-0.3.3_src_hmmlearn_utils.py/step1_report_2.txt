{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for normalization and covariance filling in statistical or machine learning contexts.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays (a, covars), especially in normalization functions and covariance transformation functions.",
  "sinks": "Modifies input arrays in-place; no direct data leakage or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into normalization functions and covariance filling functions; these modify arrays in-place but do not involve external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard numpy and scipy functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code implements normalization procedures (linear and log-space) and covariance matrix filling strategies based on the specified covariance type. It carefully handles edge cases like zero sums and degenerate cases. There are no external data transmissions, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of well-known scientific libraries and straightforward algorithms suggests benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard utility functions for statistical data normalization and covariance matrix preparation, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe and intended for mathematical computations in data processing pipelines.",
