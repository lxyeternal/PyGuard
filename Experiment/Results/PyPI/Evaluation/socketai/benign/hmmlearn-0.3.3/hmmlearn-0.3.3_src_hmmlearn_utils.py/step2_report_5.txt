  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n- The functions perform data normalization (linear and log-space) and covariance matrix shaping.\n- They utilize standard numpy and scipy functions.\n- All operations are in-place modifications of arrays.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be straightforward utility functions for statistical or machine learning tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code snippets.** The functions handle edge cases (like zero sums) safely and use well-established scientific libraries.\n\n### Logical or reasoning flaws:\n- The reports do not identify any flaws or mistakes in the code logic. The code is standard and correct for its intended purpose.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with the absence of external system interactions.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), reflecting the reviewers' assessment that the code is safe and legitimate.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The second report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is slightly higher than others, but still very low and justifiable given the in-place data modifications, which are common in numerical processing.\n\n### Malware, obfuscation, and risk scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** All agree on 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's benign nature, the risk scores are appropriately low, with no report suggesting significant concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting standard data processing functions without external system interaction.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- Considering the comprehensive review and the nature of the code, I would assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, standard utility functions for statistical modeling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is standard, well-implemented, and free from malicious or suspicious elements. The minor security risk score reflects the in-place data modifications, which are typical in such contexts but should be documented to prevent unintended side effects in sensitive environments.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns; the code is safe and appropriate for use in statistical or machine learning pipelines.",
