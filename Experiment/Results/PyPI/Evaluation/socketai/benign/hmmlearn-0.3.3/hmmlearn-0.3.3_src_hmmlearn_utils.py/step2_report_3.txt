  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists of data normalization functions (`normalize`, `log_normalize`) and a covariance matrix filling function (`fill_covars`).\n- All reports agree that the code uses standard numpy and scipy functions.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or system modifications are observed.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The functions modify data in-place but do not leak data externally or perform any harmful operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code appears straightforward and aligns with typical statistical data processing routines.\n- No evidence of bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent is found.\n- The normalization functions include safeguards against division by zero and degenerate cases.\n- The covariance filling function handles different covariance types correctly.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessment that the code is legitimate and safe is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing scores:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code detected.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign very low or zero risk (mostly 0, one report 0.1).\n- The code does not interact with external systems, handle secrets, or perform unsafe operations.\n- Slightly above zero in one report (0.1) likely due to the in-place modification pattern, but it's not a security concern.\n- **Appropriate as is.**\n\n#### Purpose and analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as utility functions for normalization and covariance matrix shaping, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the thorough review, I agree with the reports' conclusions.**  \nThe code is standard, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n| Metric            | Score  | Justification                                                      |\n|-------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware           | 0       | No malicious activity or code patterns detected.                   |\n| obfuscated        | 0       | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                   |\n| securityRisk      | 0       | No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.                    |\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code's purpose is typical for statistical or ML workflows.\n- No suspicious data flows or external interactions.\n- The in-place modifications are standard practice and pose no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is legitimate, standard utility code for data normalization and covariance matrix preparation. The scores provided by all reports are reasonable and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that the code is safe for use in production environments.\n\n**This concludes the review.**",
