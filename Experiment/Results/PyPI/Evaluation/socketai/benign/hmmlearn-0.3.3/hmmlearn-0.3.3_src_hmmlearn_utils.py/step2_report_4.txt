  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is standard, benign, and no malicious behavior is detected. The confidence is high (0.9), and malware/security risk scores are zero.\n\n- **Code review:** The functions perform typical normalization and covariance matrix filling, with safeguards against division by zero and degenerate cases. No external data flow, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard utility functions with no suspicious behavior. Slightly lower security risk score (0.1), perhaps due to cautiousness.\n\n- **Code review:** Same as above, functions are straightforward. The only note is the `securityRisk` being 0.1, possibly reflecting a conservative stance, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is standard, with a confidence of 1, and no malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Code review:** Consistent with previous assessments; functions are typical and safe.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Code review:** Functions are standard, with proper handling of edge cases.\n\n- **Verdict:** The conclusion and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard utility functions with no malicious intent. The confidence is high, and all scores are zero.\n\n- **Code review:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree the code is standard, benign, and performs typical data normalization and covariance matrix filling.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** All are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. The malware scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5:** None, all are zero or very low, consistent with safe code.\n\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the code and the reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code is straightforward utility code for statistical processing, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores and reasoning are appropriate.",
