{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for normalizing arrays and filling covariance matrices, likely for use in statistical or machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays for normalization functions ('a') and covariance parameters ('covars').",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data causes security effects; no network, file, or sensitive data access observed.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are normalized or transformed through in-place modifications; no external data flow to untrusted sources identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard numpy and scipy functions for data normalization and covariance matrix preparation. Normalize functions adjust data in-place with safeguards against division by zero. The fill_covars function creates covariance matrices based on specified types, with standard numpy operations. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears straightforward and aligns with common statistical processing tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard in data processing contexts, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs common normalization and covariance matrix shaping tasks securely and transparently.",
