  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code content.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code consists of standard normalization functions (`normalize`, `log_normalize`) and a covariance matrix filling function (`fill_covars`).\n- The functions use well-known libraries (`numpy`, `scipy`) and perform typical statistical operations.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or file I/O are present.\n- The code modifies input arrays in-place, with safeguards against division by zero or degenerate cases.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n- The logic appears straightforward and aligned with common practices in statistical or machine learning code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior. This aligns with the code content, which does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or implementation issues?**  \n  The code appears correct. The `normalize` function handles zero sums properly by setting zeros to 1 before division, preventing division by zero.  \n  The `log_normalize` function handles degenerate cases with `a.shape[axis] == 1`.  \n  The `fill_covars` function correctly constructs covariance matrices for different types, including 'full', 'diag', 'tied', and 'spherical'.  \n  No errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores and Reasonableness:\n- **Security risk scores:** All reports assign very low or zero scores, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as expected.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious intent or vulnerabilities that would warrant higher scores.\n- The code is standard utility functions, with no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is legitimate, standard in data processing, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
