  "purpose": "Implementation of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with training, decoding, sampling, and convergence monitoring functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays for likelihood calculations, posterior inference, and parameter updates; no external data sources or code injection points.",
  "sinks": "Internal probabilistic computations; no external network, file, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through likelihood functions, forward-backward algorithms, and parameter estimation routines within the class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is transparent and uses standard scientific libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of HMMs, utilizing common libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn). It performs typical probabilistic modeling tasks with no external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious constructs. The functions and class structures are clear, documented, and follow best practices. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security and malware scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to potential misuse of data inputs, which is inherent to ML code but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Hidden Markov Models with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (~0.1-0.2) scores are justified and align with the detailed analysis.",
