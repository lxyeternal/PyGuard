  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute KL divergence between various probability distributions (Dirichlet, Normal, Multivariate Normal, Gamma, Wishart).",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as distribution parameters (e.g., means, variances, shape parameters, matrices).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; computations involve mathematical operations on input parameters without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into divergence formulas; no external data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard mathematical formulas with assertions for non-negativity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard divergence calculations using numpy and scipy, relying on well-known formulas. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The only potential concern is the use of matrix inversion and log-determinant calculations, which could cause numerical issues if inputs are maliciously crafted (e.g., singular matrices). This is a typical numerical stability concern, not malicious activity. The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or external data leaks. The assertions for non-negativity are appropriate. The reliance on external _utils functions appears safe, assuming they are standard determinant and log functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of divergence functions for statistical distributions. No malicious intent or malicious code is present. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the potential for numerical issues if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this does not constitute malicious behavior or a supply chain attack. Overall, the code is trustworthy and safe for use.",
