  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of divergence functions for statistical distributions. No malicious intent or malicious code is present. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the potential for numerical issues if inputs are maliciously crafted, but this does not constitute malicious behavior or a supply chain attack. Overall, the code is trustworthy and safe for use."
