{
  "purpose": "The code provides metadata information about the 'hmmlearn' package, specifically retrieving its version number.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via importlib.metadata.version()",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data beyond reading metadata",
  "flows": "Input: importlib.metadata.version() fetches version info; Output: assigns version to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code simply retrieves package metadata",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to obtain the version of the 'hmmlearn' package using importlib.metadata. If the import fails (possibly because importlib.metadata isn't available), it sets the version to '0+unknown'. This is standard practice for package metadata retrieval. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injections are present. The code does not perform network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package metadata retrieval snippet with no malicious or security concerns. It simply handles the absence of importlib.metadata gracefully.",
