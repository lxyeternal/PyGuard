  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'hmmlearn' package using importlib.metadata, with fallback to '0+unknown' if unavailable.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('hmmlearn') call within try block",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() -> sink: assignment to __version__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and attempts to retrieve the version of 'hmmlearn'. It handles ImportError gracefully. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is simple, standard, and safe, serving only to fetch package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely to retrieve package version info. The existing reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence.",
