{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define the package name and attempts to retrieve its version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"hmmlearn\")",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data flow to external systems or sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'importlib.metadata' to get the version of the 'hmmlearn' package. It uses a try-except block to handle ImportError, setting the version to '0+unknown' if the import fails. The code performs a straightforward operation with no external data transmission, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard version retrieval snippet commonly used in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to identify the package version. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
