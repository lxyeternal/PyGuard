{
  "purpose": "The code provides metadata about the 'hmmlearn' Python package, including its description and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata using importlib.metadata.version() to obtain the package version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The source (importlib.metadata.version()) flows into the __version__ variable; no other flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, using standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to fetch the version of the 'hmmlearn' package. It attempts to assign this version to __version__, with a fallback to '0+unknown' if ImportError occurs. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. No inputs from external sources are processed; the only function used is to retrieve package metadata. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily used for package metadata management. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
