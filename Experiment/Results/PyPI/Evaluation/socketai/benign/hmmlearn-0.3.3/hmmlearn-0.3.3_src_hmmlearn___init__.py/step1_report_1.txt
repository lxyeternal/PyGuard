  "purpose": "Define the package name and retrieve its version information for hmmlearn",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('hmmlearn')",
  "sinks": "None present in the code; no untrusted data output or external connections",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected; the version retrieval is standard and safe",
  "analysis": "The code imports the importlib.metadata module to obtain the version of the hmmlearn package. It uses a try-except block to handle ImportError, defaulting to '0+unknown' if the version cannot be retrieved. No external network activity, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code appears straightforward, serving as metadata extraction without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving the purpose of retrieving package version info with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
