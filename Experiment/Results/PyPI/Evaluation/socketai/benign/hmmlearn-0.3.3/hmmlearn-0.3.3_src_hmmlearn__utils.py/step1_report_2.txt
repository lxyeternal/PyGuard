  "purpose": "Utility functions for matrix operations, covariance matrix validation, and distribution, likely used in statistical or machine learning models.",
  "sources": "np.linalg.slogdet, np.cumsum, np.split, scipy.linalg.eigvalsh, np.any, np.allclose, np.tile, np.diag",
  "sinks": "np.where, warnings.warn, raising ValueError, np.split, np.tile, np.diag",
  "flows": "np.linalg.slogdet(a) -> np.where(sign < 0, np.nan, logdet); user inputs to functions like split_X_lengths and _validate_covars; distribution functions generate matrices based on input parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Use of warnings and error raising is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions performing matrix operations, validation, and distribution tasks. It uses numpy and scipy libraries for mathematical computations, which are common in scientific code. Functions include error checks and warnings for invalid matrices, but these are standard practices. No indications of malicious behavior or backdoors are found. All data flows are within mathematical operations, with no external input handling or network activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a set of utility functions for covariance matrix validation and manipulation, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard scientific computing code that performs checks and matrix operations without any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
