  "purpose": "Implementation of various Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classes for different distributions, including categorical, Gaussian, GMM, multinomial, and Poisson, providing likelihood computation, sampling, and sufficient statistics methods.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters, attributes such as emission probabilities, means, covariances, and input data arrays; no external I/O or network communication.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flow for likelihood calculations, sampling, and statistics; no external data leaks, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through likelihood functions, sufficient statistics accumulation, and sampling methods; data is processed within the class methods without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of warnings for deprecated input shapes is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn) for statistical modeling. Input validation ensures data integrity. Sampling uses check_random_state for reproducibility. No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious code present. The logic and data flow are typical for statistical HMM implementations, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of various HMM classes, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified and appropriate given the code's nature.",
