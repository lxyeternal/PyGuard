{
  "purpose": "This code configures the Sphinx documentation system for the hmmlearn project, setting extensions, project info, themes, and URLs.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration variables and imports the hmmlearn package solely to access its version attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing hmmlearn to retrieving its version, then assigning static configuration parameters; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, importing hmmlearn only for version info. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or untrusted data. All variables are hardcoded or derived from safe package attributes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
