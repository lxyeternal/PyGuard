{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for AWS Secrets Manager integration, mocking credentials, secrets, and environment variables to verify secret retrieval and configuration resolution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables patched for AWS credentials, secrets created and retrieved via boto3 client, secrets used within configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "Secrets are used internally within the test environment; no external data leaks or network activity outside mocked AWS services.",
  "flows": "Secrets are generated or set via mocks, then retrieved and assigned to configuration attributes, with no external or untrusted data flow outside the test scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; standard testing practices employed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard mocking and environment patching to test AWS Secrets Manager interactions. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The use of moto and pytest fixtures is typical for such testing environments. No hardcoded secrets or external data exfiltration observed. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The security risk is minimal, confined to the test environment, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment indicates a safe, benign testing setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test suite for AWS Secrets Manager integration, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
