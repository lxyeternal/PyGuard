{
  "purpose": "Define and test configuration classes that load environment variables using the environ library, supporting default values and class methods for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, especially in functions like `from_environ()` and class attribute defaults.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or places where untrusted data is processed in a harmful way, such as system calls, network operations, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read in class methods and attribute defaults; no flow to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables with flexible naming (`from_environ` parameter), but no malicious anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines configuration data structures using the `environ` library, with environment variable defaults and conversion. Several classes demonstrate different configurations and tests check their behavior. The environment variables are used solely for configuration; no input/output operations, no network connections, or data exfiltration points are present. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. Usage is typical for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard configuration class definitions and tests without malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes environment variables safely for configuration purposes, with no signs of malicious or harmful behavior.",
