{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration classes for an application using the 'environ' library, allowing environment variables to populate class attributes with default values and converters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via 'environ.var()' and the 'environ' dictionary passed explicitly in 'from_environ()' calls.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any data sinks; it primarily reads environment variables for configuration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables (sources) into class attributes through 'environ.var()' and 'from_environ()' methods, with no external or untrusted data output or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to typical configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes the 'environ' library to load environment variables into configuration classes. All variables have default values, and there are no dynamic or insecure operations. No data is transmitted externally, and no malicious behavior is evident. The code serves as a secure configuration setup without malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for Python applications using 'environ' and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to load environment variables into data classes safely.",
