{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration classes for an application using the 'environ' library, allowing environment variables to set configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via 'environ.var' calls, potentially influenced by external environment settings.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data or untrusted input is written or transmitted outside the application.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read by 'environ.var' and assigned to class attributes; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials beyond standard defaults, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Usage appears to be standard for configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the 'environ' library to define configuration classes with environment variable defaults. It contains test functions that verify the presence of class methods and default values, including support for environment overrides. All code appears to implement standard configuration pattern without malicious behavior. There are no signs of data leakage, external network communication, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for an application, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely reads environment variables for configuration purposes and includes tests to verify expected behavior.",
