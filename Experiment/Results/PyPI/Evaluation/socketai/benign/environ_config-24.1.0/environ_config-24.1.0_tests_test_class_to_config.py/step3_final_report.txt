  "purpose": "Configuration classes utilizing 'environ' to load environment variables with defaults, converters, and optional renaming for application setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via 'environ.var' calls within class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network transmissions, or file operations; environment variables are used solely for configuration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables to class attributes during class instantiation; no external or untrusted data flow to other systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration classes that read environment variables with defaults and optional renaming, using 'environ'. The test functions verify expected behaviors, including default values and environment overrides. No malicious behavior, external data transmission, or obfuscation is present. The code follows standard patterns for environment-based configuration management, with no signs of security issues or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, conventional usage of environment variables for application configuration.",
