{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility function designed to retrieve a default secret value or raise an exception if a secret is missing.",
  "sources": "The function _get_default_secret reads the 'default' parameter passed to it, which may originate from environment variables or configuration data.",
  "sinks": "The function may raise a MissingSecretError if certain conditions are met, which could be caught and handled elsewhere, but it does not directly write or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The source (default parameter) is evaluated; if it is an instance of attr.Factory, it returns attr.NOTHING; if it is an instance of Raise, it raises MissingSecretError; otherwise, it returns default.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of attr.Factory and custom exception handling is standard. No obfuscation or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function that retrieves a secret or raises an exception. It handles two special types: attr.Factory and Raise. It ensures that missing secrets are properly flagged by raising a specific exception. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The logic is straightforward and intended for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function for secret handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or leak information. It appears safe and legitimate.",
