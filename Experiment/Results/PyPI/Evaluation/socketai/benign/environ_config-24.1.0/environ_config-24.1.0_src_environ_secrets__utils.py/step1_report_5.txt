{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility function to retrieve a secret value from environment/configuration, either returning a default or raising an error if missing.",
  "sources": "The function `_get_default_secret` reads the parameter `default`, which is intended to be a default secret value or configuration setting.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any data sinks or external data outputs; it only returns or raises exceptions based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters `var` and `default` flow into the function, which then conditionally either returns a default value or raises an exception, without external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code uses type checking and conditional logic appropriately; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to obtain secrets or configuration values, raising exceptions if secrets are missing. It checks the type of `default`, returning `attr.NOTHING` if it is an `attr.Factory`, raising `MissingSecretError` if `default` is a `Raise` object, otherwise returning `default`. The code appears standard, safe, and aligned with configuration management practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data leaks, network activity, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward utility function for configuration or secret management with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or external communications.",
