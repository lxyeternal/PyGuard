  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**1. Code Confirmation & Issues Presence:**\n- The code is a simple utility function `_get_default_secret` that checks the type of the `default` parameter and either returns a value, returns `attr.NOTHING`, or raises a `MissingSecretError`.\n- The code matches the description across all reports; no discrepancies are evident.\n- No issues such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the function handles `attr.Factory` and `Raise` objects appropriately.\n- They note that the function raises exceptions or returns defaults as intended.\n- No logical errors or flaws are apparent in the report summaries; they are consistent with the code.\n\n**3. Score Review & Reasonableness:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.1 or 0, which seems reasonable given the context. The minimal risk is due to exception raising, which is a controlled behavior.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious activities.\n- The exception handling is standard and does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Malware Score Justification:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic or behavior.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify this as a utility function for secret management.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  *The code is benign, with no malicious intent or behavior.*\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  *The code is straightforward and clear.*\n\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1  \n  *Minimal risk, mainly related to exception handling, which is controlled.*\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign utility function for secret management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' scores are appropriate and align with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No changes needed.",
