  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a small utility function `_get_default_secret` that inspects the `default` parameter and acts accordingly.\n- It checks if `default` is an `attr.Factory` (returns `attr.NOTHING`), if it is a `Raise` object (raises `MissingSecretError`), or else returns `default`.\n- There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- The logic is straightforward, aligned with standard configuration/secret management patterns.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or data leaks are indicated.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches its described purpose. No issues are present.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected; scores are correctly set to 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; scores are correctly set to 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; the code is a utility function with no evident vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate.\n\n### Specific points on the scoring:\n- The **malware score** is 0 in all reports, which is justified.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The **security risk score** is 0.1 or 0, which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Any anomalies or concerns?\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The reports do not mention any external dependencies or data leaks.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (possibly slightly conservative, but acceptable given it raises exceptions which could affect control flow if misused)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the exception-raising behavior, but this is standard for secret management utilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
