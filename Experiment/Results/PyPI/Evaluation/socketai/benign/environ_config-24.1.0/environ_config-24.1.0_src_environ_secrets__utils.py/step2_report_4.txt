  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple utility function `_get_default_secret` that handles secrets or configuration defaults.\n- It checks the type of `default` and acts accordingly:\n  - If `default` is an `attr.Factory`, it returns `attr.NOTHING`.\n  - If `default` is a `Raise` object, it raises `MissingSecretError`.\n  - Otherwise, it returns `default`.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard configuration management practices.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- It is a utility for secret management, not handling sensitive data directly.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n\n**Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reasoning in each report is sound.\n- The handling of `attr.Factory` returning `attr.NOTHING` is standard in `attrs`.\n- Raising `MissingSecretError` when `default` is a `Raise` object is consistent.\n- No flawed assumptions or reasoning are evident.\n\n**Confirmed:** No logical flaws or mistakes in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.1 or 0 (very low)\n  - `confidence`: mostly 1, some 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- Obfuscation is correctly 0.\n- Security risk is minimal; the code handles secrets safely and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:** No score adjustments needed; they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- No justification exists for higher scores, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Confirmed:** No higher-than-justified risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- Both are correctly set to 0 across reports, matching the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as a utility for secret handling.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard utility function with no security flaws.\n- It does not handle sensitive data directly, nor does it perform any network or file operations.\n- The exception handling is appropriate and does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are; no adjustments needed.",
