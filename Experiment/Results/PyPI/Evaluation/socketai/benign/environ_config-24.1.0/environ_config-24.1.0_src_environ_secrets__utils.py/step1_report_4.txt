{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for configuration management, specifically to retrieve default secrets or raise errors if secrets are missing.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'default' parameter passed to the _get_default_secret function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process untrusted data in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Input 'default' is checked and either returned, replaced with attr.NOTHING, or used to raise an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The use of attr.Factory and Raise appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function _get_default_secret checks the type of the 'default' parameter. If it's an attr.Factory, it returns attr.NOTHING. If it's a Raise object, it raises a MissingSecretError. Otherwise, it returns the default value. The code appears to be a utility for handling secrets and does not perform any malicious actions or insecure operations. There are no suspicious imports or operations, and the logic aligns with common configuration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for secret management without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. Overall, it appears safe and straightforward.",
