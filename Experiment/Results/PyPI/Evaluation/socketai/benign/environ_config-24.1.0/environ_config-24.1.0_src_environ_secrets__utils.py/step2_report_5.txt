  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, a utility function `_get_default_secret` that returns a default value or raises an exception based on the type of `default`.\n- The code uses `attr.Factory` and a custom `Raise` class to determine behavior.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward utility for secret/configuration management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code logic matches the descriptions; it correctly handles the types and raises exceptions as intended.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is benign.\n- **Security risks:** The function's purpose is to manage secrets securely, with no leaks or insecure operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: benign, straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** Generally 0.1 or 0, reflecting minimal or no security risk, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions or contain hidden logic.\n- The handling of `attr.Factory` and `Raise` is standard for configuration management.\n- No external data flow or potential for exploitation is evident.\n- The exception `MissingSecretError` is used appropriately.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — consistent and justified.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — consistent and justified.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the benign nature, I would set it at **0.1** or **0**, aligning with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Overall malware and obfuscation scores:** 0, as there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Overall risk score:** 0.1, reflecting a very low security risk due to the function's utility nature and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard, safe utility for secret handling.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as-is, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk score at 0.1. The code is safe and does not warrant concern for malicious activity.",
