{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle environment variable secrets, either retrieving defaults or raising errors if secrets are missing.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'var' and 'default' are sources of input, specifically related to secret management.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raising 'MissingSecretError' if conditions are met; no direct sink for untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'var' and 'default' are checked, with the flow leading to either returning a default or raising an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. Use of attr.Factory is standard in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to retrieve a secret or raise an error if not available. It handles defaults and raises a custom exception if required. No external data fetching, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility function for secret management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, secure utility for secret handling, with no malicious behavior detected. It properly raises exceptions when secrets are missing. Overall, it is a safe and standard pattern for secret management.",
