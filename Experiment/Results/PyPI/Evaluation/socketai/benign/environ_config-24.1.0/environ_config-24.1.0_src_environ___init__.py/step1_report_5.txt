{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a part of a Python package module providing access to environment configuration, secrets, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import of 'secrets' module, metadata from importlib.metadata, and attribute access via __getattr__ function.",
  "sinks": "Access to package metadata such as 'Project-URL' and 'Author-email', which are returned as strings.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__, which retrieves metadata and returns specific fields; no untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to provide deprecated metadata access; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. Warnings are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that exports configuration, secrets, and exception components. The __getattr__ function dynamically retrieves package metadata, issuing a deprecation warning. It safely accesses the 'metadata' function from importlib.metadata and parses specific fields. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of warnings and attribute handling appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for accessing package metadata with a deprecated method, providing no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles metadata safely and does not process untrusted input or perform suspicious operations.",
