{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module for environment configuration management, including access to metadata and deprecated attribute handling.",
  "sources": "Metadata retrieved from importlib.metadata for the package 'environ-config'. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points are present. No output or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; metadata is read from package metadata and internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings for attribute access; no suspicious code behavior observed. The attribute access logic and deprecation warning are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package metadata and deprecation warnings. It accesses package metadata via importlib.metadata, parses specific fields, and issues warnings for deprecated attribute access. No user input, network communication, or data leakage is present. The code does not perform any malicious activities or contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign implementation for package metadata access with deprecation warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
