  "purpose": "Accesses package metadata attributes (__version__, __description__, __uri__, __email__) with deprecation warnings, serving as a metadata accessor module.",
  "sources": "Metadata retrieval via importlib.metadata.metadata() for package info fields.",
  "sinks": "Returns specific metadata fields; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers warnings and metadata fetch, then returns the requested info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated attribute access and warnings; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward package metadata access, issuing deprecation warnings for certain attributes. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or handle secrets. The only notable behavior is the deprecation warning, which is standard practice. The metadata fields accessed could, in theory, be manipulated if the package repository is compromised, but this is a supply chain concern rather than a code issue. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple metadata accessor with deprecation warnings. There is no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the potential for manipulated package metadata if the repository is compromised, which is outside the scope of code security but relevant for supply chain considerations.",
