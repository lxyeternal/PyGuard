  "purpose": "This module provides configuration and environment variable handling with deprecation warnings for certain attributes and imports project metadata.",
  "sources": "Metadata retrieval via importlib.metadata.metadata('environ-config'), attribute access (__getattr__).",
  "sinks": "Returning metadata values (e.g., Project-URL, Author-email) that could contain untrusted data if the package metadata is compromised.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (__getattr__) triggers metadata retrieval, which returns specific metadata fields.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated attributes, access to package metadata, no direct user input handling, no hardcoded secrets, no code execution or network operations. The deprecation warning suggests awareness of future attribute removal but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an environment/configuration module that uses importlib.metadata to fetch package metadata. It includes a deprecated __getattr__ method that warns users about future removal and retrieves metadata such as version, description, URL, and email. The metadata fetched could theoretically contain untrusted data if package metadata is maliciously crafted or compromised, but there is no evidence of malicious code or data exfiltration. The use of warnings and attribute handling appears standard for a package info module. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata accessor with deprecation warnings. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the potential for returning manipulated metadata if the package repository is compromised, but this is not specific to malicious intent. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
