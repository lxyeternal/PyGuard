  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The only dynamic element is the use of `metadata.version(\"environ-config\")` to retrieve the package version.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis per report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** All describe the code as a configuration for Sphinx documentation, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Sources:** All mention the use of `importlib.metadata` to get package version info, which is standard.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or data leaks; static configuration with safe data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All correctly conclude the code is benign, with standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration script.\n- The only dynamic aspect is retrieving package version info, which is safe.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or code execution that could pose security risks.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No changes needed; all assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final System-Level Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration script. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
