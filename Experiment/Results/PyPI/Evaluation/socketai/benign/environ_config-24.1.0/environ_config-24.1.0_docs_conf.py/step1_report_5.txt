  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation and project metadata setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from importlib.metadata, project variables, and Sphinx configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; primarily static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input; mostly static assignments and library calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The only dynamic element is retrieving package version via metadata.version().",
  "analysis": "The code imports package metadata, uses it to set version info, and configures Sphinx documentation options. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is present. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed. The only dynamic behavior is fetching package version, which is standard and safe. Overall, the code is a straightforward configuration file with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration with no malicious or security risks. It uses safe, static configuration and standard library calls. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
