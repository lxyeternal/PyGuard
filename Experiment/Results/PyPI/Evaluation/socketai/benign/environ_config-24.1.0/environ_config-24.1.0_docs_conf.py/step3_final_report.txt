{
  "purpose": "The code configures Sphinx documentation settings, specifying extensions, paths, and project metadata, including fetching the package version via importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package version using metadata.version('environ-config')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or external data flows",
  "flows": "Static configuration with package version retrieval; no external or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. It imports metadata to retrieve the package version, which is a common and safe practice. No untrusted input, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The code is static, well-structured, and follows typical conventions. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors are detected. The only dynamic element is fetching the version, which is safe and standard. No security risks or malware behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It correctly uses package metadata for versioning without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
