  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The only dynamic operation involves calling `metadata.version(\"environ-config\")` to retrieve the package version.\n- No untrusted input, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are reported or implied.\n- The code's purpose is purely to configure documentation build parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports confirm the code is benign and standard.\n- **Malicious activity or vulnerabilities:** None detected.\n- **Data leaks or external data handling:** None.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** None.\n- **Use of `metadata.version()` is standard practice for version retrieval.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0`, justified by the benign nature and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n- The only \"dynamic\" aspect—fetching package version—is a common and safe practice.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted here.\n- The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the code and reports, I concur with the evaluations.**  \nThe code is a straightforward, safe configuration script with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways monitor for future updates or dynamic behaviors, but based on the current static analysis, this code is safe.",
