{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of classes and functions for securely managing and loading sensitive data such as secrets from various sources like INI files, directories, environment variables, and secret management services.",
  "sources": "Reading secrets from INI files, environment variables, secrets stored in filesystem directories, and environment variable naming conventions for secret management services.",
  "sinks": "Retrieving secret values which are stored as plain text in environment variables, files, or INI configurations; no direct data leakage sink observed.",
  "flows": "Secrets are sourced from files, environment variables, or external services and then accessed via class methods that return secret strings wrapped in a _SecretStr object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code segments detected. The code appears to focus solely on secret management with safe string handling to prevent accidental leaks in logs or debug outputs. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured utility for secure secret handling, utilizing standard libraries and patterns. It contains classes for loading secrets from various sources with delayed loading, environment variable support, and secret masking in representations. The import fallback for AWS secrets management is standard and raises an exception if unavailable. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. It handles secrets safely with no evident malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, legitimate utility for secret management. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure and logic focus on secret safety and flexibility without suspicious activity.",
