  "purpose": "Handling of sensitive data including secrets from environment variables, INI files, directories, and secret management services.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, INI configuration files, secret files in directories, AWS Secrets Manager (via boto3), environment variables following envconsul style.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval points for secrets via environment variables, config files, or secret files; no data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Secrets are loaded from sources (env, files, INI) and accessed via _get methods, with masking in _SecretStr; no external data flows or malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Debug logs for secret access could expose secrets if logs are insecure; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments; fallback for AWS secrets raises exception if boto3 missing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard secret management utility employing safe practices such as delayed loading, exception handling, and secret masking. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks are evident. Debug logs, while potentially exposing secrets if logs are insecure, are typical during development and do not constitute malicious activity. The fallback for AWS secrets raises an exception if boto3 is not installed, which is a safe and expected behavior. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security risk primarily related to log exposure, which is a common concern but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure secret management utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
