  "purpose": "Handle sensitive data stored in AWS Secrets Manager, providing a structured way to load secrets securely within a Python application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (environ), AWS Secrets Manager via boto3 client",
  "sinks": "AWS Secrets Manager API calls (get_secret_value)",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> secret name resolution -> boto3.get_secret_value",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscation; use of logging without sanitization; reliance on environment variables for secret names",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages secrets by fetching secret values from AWS Secrets Manager, utilizing environment variables for secret identifiers. It includes proper use of boto3 client instantiation, dynamic secret name resolution, and default fallback mechanisms. The logging statements provide debug info but do not expose secret data. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. The code does not perform any data leakage or privacy violations outside intended secret handling. It appears to be a legitimate secret management utility with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for accessing AWS Secrets Manager secrets. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks beyond normal secret management practices. No indicators of sabotage or malicious intent are present.",
