{
  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve sensitive data secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using environment variables and boto3 client.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., environ[secret_name_envvar]) to get secret identifiers; boto3.client('secretsmanager') to retrieve secrets from AWS.",
  "sinks": "Returning the secret value from AWS Secrets Manager; potentially exposing secrets if misused.",
  "flows": "Environment variable lookup (source) -> boto3.get_secret_value (sink) for retrieving secrets, based on environment variable values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variables identified.",
  "analysis": "The code loads secrets from AWS Secrets Manager based on environment variables or defaults, using boto3. It correctly constructs a client, retrieves environment variables, and fetches secrets securely. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious logic identified. The code adheres to standard secure practices for secret management. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration routines. The use of logging appears appropriate for debugging and does not reveal sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for secure secrets retrieval from AWS Secrets Manager with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
