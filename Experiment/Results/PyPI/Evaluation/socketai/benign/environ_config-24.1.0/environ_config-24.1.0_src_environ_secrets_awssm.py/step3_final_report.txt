  "sources": "Environment variables for secret names, boto3 client calls to get_secret_value",

  "flows": "Environment variable lookup -> boto3.get_secret_value call",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation for retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. It uses standard practices: lazy client instantiation, environment variables for secret names, and default fallbacks. Logging is at debug level but does not log secret values. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. The only minor concern is the use of debug logs, which could expose secrets if logs are insecure, but since secrets are not logged, this is not a security issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-structured utility for managing secrets with AWS. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
