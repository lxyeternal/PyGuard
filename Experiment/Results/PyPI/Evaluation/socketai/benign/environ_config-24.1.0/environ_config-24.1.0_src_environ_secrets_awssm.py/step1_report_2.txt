  "purpose": "Handling of sensitive data stored in AWS Secrets Manager, providing a secure interface to retrieve secrets.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (environ), AWS Secrets Manager API via boto3 client",
  "sinks": "AWS Secrets Manager get_secret_value API, environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> _get() method -> boto3 client.get_secret_value() call",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors. Use of boto3 is standard, no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using boto3, with proper abstraction and logging. It dynamically constructs secret names from environment variables or defaults, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is present. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, system modification, or network connection outside the AWS API. It follows best practices for secret management without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for retrieving secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain malware or security risks beyond the normal considerations of handling sensitive data, which are managed appropriately.",
