{
  "purpose": "The code manages retrieval of sensitive data stored in AWS Secrets Manager, providing an interface for secret handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables to determine secret names, and retrieves secrets via AWS Secrets Manager client.",
  "sinks": "The secrets retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager are returned for use within the application, potentially leading to exposure if misused.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine secret identifiers; these identifiers are used as input to AWS Secrets Manager's get_secret_value method, which fetches the secret data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. Logging occurs, but this is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly interfaces with AWS Secrets Manager, creating a client when needed, and retrieves secrets based on environment variable names. The secret name can be explicitly specified or constructed from prefix and name parts. The code handles missing environment variables gracefully by defaulting to a specified fallback. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code. The use of boto3 and environment variables is standard, with no evident misuse or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for securely managing secrets with AWS Secrets Manager. No malicious intent or security risks are evident; it appears to be a legitimate, well-structured secret management utility.",
