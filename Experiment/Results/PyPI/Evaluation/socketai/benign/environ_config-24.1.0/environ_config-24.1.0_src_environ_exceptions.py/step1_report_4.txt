  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for environment configuration errors in *environ-config* library.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data acquisition code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or output).",
  "flows": "None (no source-to-sink data flows).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from built-in Exception classes. No input handling, data transmission, or suspicious logic is included. The code appears to be a standard, well-documented exception class module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions related to environment configuration errors. There is no malicious intent or security risk associated with this code. It is purely structural and serves as part of a larger, benign library.",
