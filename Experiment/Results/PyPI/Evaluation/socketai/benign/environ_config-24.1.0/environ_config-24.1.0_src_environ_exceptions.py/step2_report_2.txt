  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no input/output, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and standard for such purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes without any operational logic or data handling. There are no logical flaws or mistakes in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**  \n   The code is a standard set of custom exception classes used in configuration handling. No signs of supply chain threats, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk associated with these class definitions)\n\n**These scores align with the analysis.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' consistent conclusions, I agree with the current scores. There is no evidence to suggest any malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
