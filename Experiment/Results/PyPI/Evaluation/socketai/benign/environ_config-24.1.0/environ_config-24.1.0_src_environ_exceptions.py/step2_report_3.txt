  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class.\n- It contains no input/output operations, no data processing, no network activity, and no dynamic or obfuscated code.\n- The license comments and class docstrings are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain threats.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as defining custom exception classes for environment configuration errors.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data sources or sinks; no data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; code is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Same observations as Report 1, emphasizing that the code is just exception class definitions, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar analysis; no input/output or malicious patterns.\n- The code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: benign, standard exception classes, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous; no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores consistent with the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Are any scores unreasonable?**  \n  No. The code is purely class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n- **Any assumptions or claims that are questionable?**  \n  No. All analyses correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**These scores are consistent and justified.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes for environment configuration error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain threats. The provided reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
