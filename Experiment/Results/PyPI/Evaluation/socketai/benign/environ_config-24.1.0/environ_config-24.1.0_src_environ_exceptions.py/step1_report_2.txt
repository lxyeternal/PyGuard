  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for environment configuration errors in the *environ-config* library.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as the code is solely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides exception classes to handle specific configuration errors related to environment variables and secrets. There are no data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive processes. It appears to be a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions used for error handling in configuration management. There are no malicious behaviors, security concerns, or obfuscation present.",
