  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions. It contains no input/output operations, no data processing, no network activity, or any dynamic behavior.\n   - The classes inherit from Python's `Exception` or a custom `ConfigError`, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - The license headers and comments are standard and do not suggest any malicious intent.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or embedded payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions with no processing logic.\n   - They consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n   - The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` score of 1 is justified due to the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code is just exception class definitions, there's no reason to consider any higher risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity, payload, or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - The uniformity across reports indicates a consensus on the benign nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for configuration error handling.\n- There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.",
