  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling configuration and environment variable errors in *environ-config*.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks since no input/output operations are included.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes related to environment configuration errors. It includes standard inheritance from Python's Exception classes. There are no input or output operations, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs or behaviors. The license comments and class definitions are typical and do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to pose any threat or be involved in supply chain attacks.",
