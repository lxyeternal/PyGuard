{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for environment configuration errors, including missing environment variables and secrets.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definitions are static and do not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are only definitions without operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with standard license comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with descriptive docstrings. There are no input/output operations, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is typical boilerplate for configuration error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. All signals indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
