  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling environment configuration errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code behaviors; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, serving as custom exception types for environment configuration management. There are no input reads, no data processing, no network activity, or suspicious operations. The license comments and class docstrings are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes used for environment configuration error handling. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain threats.",
