  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for environment configuration errors in the *environ-config* library.",
  "sources": "No external data input; static class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; exception classes are simple data containers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. All classes inherit from standard Exception or custom ConfigError, serving as error types. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes for configuration errors. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code appears safe and benign.",
