  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines five custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception` or `ConfigError`.\n- All classes are straightforward, with no methods or logic.\n- The code contains only license comments and class definitions.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude that the code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n- No anomalies, no obfuscated code, no signs of malware.\n- The confidence level is high (1), and all scores for obfuscated, malware, and security risk are zero.\n- The reasoning is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is only class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The analysis is accurate and consistent. The code is simple and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only describe the code's nature.\n\n- **Any signs of supply chain threats?**  \n  No. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, **the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely class definitions for exception handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is typical boilerplate code for a configuration library.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risks are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk. The code is benign and poses no threat.",
