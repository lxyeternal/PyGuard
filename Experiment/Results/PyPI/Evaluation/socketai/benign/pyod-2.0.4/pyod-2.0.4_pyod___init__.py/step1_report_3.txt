{
  "purpose": "This code defines the package's public interface and version information, serving as an initialization or entry point for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: models, utils, and version information (__version__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules 'models' and 'utils', as well as the version string '__version__' from a local module. It then defines '__all__' to specify public API exports. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The code appears to be boilerplate setup typical of Python package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes modules and version info for the package. The risk and malware scores are effectively zero; confidence is high that this is benign.",
