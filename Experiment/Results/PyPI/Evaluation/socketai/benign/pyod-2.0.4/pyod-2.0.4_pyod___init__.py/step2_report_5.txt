  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, anomalies, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward __init__.py file, importing internal modules and exposing __version__ and other symbols via __all__.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code structure is standard for Python package initialization.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are observed.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code snippet provided.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code is purely for module setup.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** None; no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n### Scoring rationale:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risk identified.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is standard boilerplate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a typical, benign package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.",
