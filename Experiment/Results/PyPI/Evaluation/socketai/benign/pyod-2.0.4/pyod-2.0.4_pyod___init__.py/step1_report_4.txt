  "purpose": "Define module exports and import internal submodules and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (models, utils) and version data from version.py",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted data processing identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no untrusted data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward module import and export setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules 'models' and 'utils', as well as the '__version__' string from version.py. It then defines __all__ for module exports. There are no data inputs, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a standard module initialization script with no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python module setup for exports with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It performs basic import and export declarations without handling untrusted data or executing any suspicious operations.",
