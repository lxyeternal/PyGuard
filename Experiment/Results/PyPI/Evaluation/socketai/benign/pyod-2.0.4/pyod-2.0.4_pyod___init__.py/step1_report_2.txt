{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module initialization file that imports internal modules and exposes certain attributes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: models, utils, and version (__version__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions; no external data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "Imports source data from internal modules, and exposes __version__ via __all__; no external data flow or untrusted input handling observed",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs or suspicious patterns. The __version__ import is standard for versioning, and all imports are from local modules",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file for a Python package, setting up module exports and versioning. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is simple and standard for package initialization. There are no external data sources, no code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as a standard package __init__.py file.",
