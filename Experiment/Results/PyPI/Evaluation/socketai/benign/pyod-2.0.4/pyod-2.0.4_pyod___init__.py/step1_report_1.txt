  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute code dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only performs static import and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import and export structure with no suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, primarily establishing module interfaces and version information. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or potentially malicious behavior detected. It adheres to standard package setup conventions without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
