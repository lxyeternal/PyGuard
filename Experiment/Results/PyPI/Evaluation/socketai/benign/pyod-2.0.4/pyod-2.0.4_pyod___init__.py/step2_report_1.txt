  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward `__init__.py`-like module that imports internal modules (`models`, `utils`, `version`) and sets `__all__` accordingly.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or obfuscated constructs.\n   - The code is minimal and adheres to standard Python package initialization patterns.\n\n2. **Issues and Anomalies:**\n   - No issues, anomalies, or suspicious behaviors are observed across all reports.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code dynamically.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is purely import/export boilerplate, any higher scores would be unjustified.\n   - The high confidence scores (1) are justified, given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard package initialization script.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation detected.\n   - The scores provided are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n6. **My own estimates:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
