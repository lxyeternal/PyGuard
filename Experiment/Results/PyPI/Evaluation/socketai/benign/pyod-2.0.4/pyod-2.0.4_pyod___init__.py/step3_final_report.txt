{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package __init__.py file, importing internal modules ('models', 'utils', 'version') and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code performs static imports only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python package initialization script that imports internal modules and sets __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard patterns justify these assessments, with no anomalies or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package __init__.py file with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
