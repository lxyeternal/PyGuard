{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an initialization or package setup file, exposing modules and version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.models, .utils, .version) and the version string from __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules and exposes __version__ in __all__; no data flows involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; only module imports and __all__ declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and a version string, then declares __all__ for module exports. It functions as a standard package initialization script with no external data input, no data processing, and no malicious or unusual behavior detected. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
