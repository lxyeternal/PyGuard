  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'pyod' Python library, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'pyod/version.py' via exec(), reads README.rst and requirements.txt from local files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, network calls, or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reads static files; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if 'version.py' is tampered with, but common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py pattern with no malicious behavior. The only potential concern is executing code from 'version.py' via exec(), which is standard but could be risky if the file is compromised. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The malware score is 0, as there's no malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the exec() pattern's potential risk but considering it standard practice. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the reports' assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup script with minimal security risk. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for version loading, which is typical but warrants trust in the 'version.py' integrity. Overall, no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
