{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pyod' Python library, including reading metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'pyod/version.py', reads README.rst, requirements.txt, and user inputs from these files during setup.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks involved; no untrusted data flows into system actions or external calls.",
  "flows": "Read version info, README, and requirements; then proceed with setup configuration without external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package. It reads version info from a separate file, loads README content and requirements, and invokes setuptools.setup() with typical metadata. No external or untrusted data is processed at runtime beyond reading static files. The code adheres to common packaging practices and does not contain suspicious or malicious code elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
