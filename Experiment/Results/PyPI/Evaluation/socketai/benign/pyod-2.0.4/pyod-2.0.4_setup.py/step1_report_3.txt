  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pyod' Python library, handling versioning, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'pyod/version.py', reading README.rst, reading requirements.txt",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or insecure handling of data",
  "flows": "Read version -> read README -> read requirements -> setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup procedure, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup operations: reading version info, documentation, and dependencies from files, then configuring setup(). No external or untrusted data is processed beyond reading static files. No code execution other than reading files is performed. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior detected.",
