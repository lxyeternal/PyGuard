  "purpose": "This module imports various utility, statistical, and data functions from submodules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported submodules: .data, .stat_models, and .utility.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code only imports functions and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from submodules; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports functions from other parts of the package and defines __all__ for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports provided are empty, indicating no issues were identified or reported. Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, and the lack of any suspicious signals, the code appears benign. The absence of claims or analysis in the reports supports assigning minimal risk and malware scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured module with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The empty reports suggest no issues were detected or reported. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe.",
