  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The provided code appears to be a straightforward Python module that imports functions from various submodules and defines an `__all__` list for exports. There are no obvious signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is clean, with no embedded malware, suspicious imports, or obfuscated constructs.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports**:  \n   All reports are empty responses labeled as errors (\"Empty response\"). This means there is no detailed information, analysis, or claims about the code in any of the reports. As a result, there are no assertions, vulnerabilities, or malware claims to evaluate or challenge.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   Since all reports are empty, there are no logical flaws, reasoning errors, or mistakes to identify. The reports do not provide any context, analysis, or conclusions.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   Without any claims or evidence, assigning high scores for malware, obfuscation, or risk would be unwarranted. The lack of any analysis suggests that the reports do not identify any issues.\n\n5. **Potential Malicious Activity or Vulnerabilities**:  \n   Based solely on the code provided, there is no indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The code imports common functions, and nothing in the code suggests malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   Since the reports are empty, any assigned scores should be minimal or zero, reflecting no detected issues.\n\n7. **Final Assessment**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n   - **Risk Score**: 0 (no identified risks)  \n\n**Summary**:  \nGiven the lack of information, the code appears benign, and the reports do not provide any insights or claims to challenge. The scores should be set to zero across the board, reflecting no detected issues.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nAwait more detailed reports or conduct a manual review if concerns persist, but based on current data, the code is safe.",
