  "purpose": "Utility functions for PyTorch models, including dataset handling, layer creation, activation, optimizer, and weight initialization.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, activation function selection, optimizer configuration, dataset indexing, and data normalization.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or external data outputs; purely local computations and data transformations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset inputs through normalization and indexing, into model layers, with parameters initialized and optimizers configured, without external or malicious data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. Code is well-structured, documented, and uses standard PyTorch APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for PyTorch models, including dataset class, layer with activation and batch normalization, activation function factory, optimizer factory, criterion factory, and weight initialization. No network activity, external data handling, or obfuscated code present. The functions are straightforward, well-documented, and use common APIs. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns identified. The code's purpose is purely utility, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe for supply chain use. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0-0.1 are appropriate and conservative.",
