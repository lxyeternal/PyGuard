{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing, initializing, and managing PyTorch neural network models and datasets.",
  "sources": "Imports of torch and torch.nn modules; class definitions; functions for activation, optimizer, criterion retrieval, and weight initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks, network connections, or untrusted data handling points detected; functions primarily perform local model configuration and data processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows include dataset normalization, layer weight initialization, and activation/optimizer/criterion selection, all within safe, controlled constructs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions and classes for PyTorch model setup, including dataset handling, layer construction, activation and optimizer selection, and weight initialization. All functions use publicly documented APIs and parameters. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to serve legitimate model-building purposes with no hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-documented utility module for PyTorch models without any indications of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for neural network configuration and data handling, with no suspicious signals or backdoors.",
