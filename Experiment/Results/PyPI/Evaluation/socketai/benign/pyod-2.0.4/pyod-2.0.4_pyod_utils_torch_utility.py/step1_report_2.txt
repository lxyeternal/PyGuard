  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing, initializing, and managing PyTorch neural network models and datasets.",
  "sources": "Imports of torch and torch.nn modules; functions and classes that define dataset handling, layer construction, activation, optimizer, loss, and weight initialization.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code writes to files, makes network connections, or handles untrusted inputs in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Data is input through dataset classes; model layers process data; activation, optimizer, loss, and weight initialization functions provide configuration but do not execute external or unsafe code flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious functions detected. The code is standard for neural network utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard PyTorch utility functions for datasets, neural network layers, activations, optimizers, loss functions, and weight initialization. No external network calls, file operations, or untrusted data processing are present. All functions are typical for model development, with safe parameter handling and no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for PyTorch models with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a well-structured, standard implementation for model construction and configuration.",
