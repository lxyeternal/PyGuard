  "purpose": "Utility functions for creating, initializing, and managing PyTorch models, datasets, and related components.",
  "sources": "Imports from torch and torch.nn, class and function definitions, configuration parameters, and function calls for model and data setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted external data, network operations, or system modifications. No file I/O, network connections, or command execution present.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes and functions for model building and initialization; data is processed within class methods but no external or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of standard PyTorch functions and practices; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for dataset handling, model layer creation, activation selection, optimizer and loss function retrieval, and weight initialization. All components use standard PyTorch APIs and common practices without external data injection, malicious behavior, or system-level operations. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be standard utility functions for PyTorch model development, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. It is safe and benign.",
