  "purpose": "Visualization utilities for plotting inliers and outliers in datasets and model results, including predicted vs. true labels.",
  "sources": "Data inputs such as X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred, y_test_pred, and external functions check_consistent_shape and get_outliers_inliers.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions that generate figures; optional file saving via plt.savefig.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through shape validation and outlier detection functions into plotting routines, with optional saving of figures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; optional figure saving is parameter-controlled and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard visualization utility for ML datasets, performing shape validation, outlier detection, and plotting. It relies on external, presumably safe, functions for data validation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The optional saving of figures is controlled via parameters, and the code structure is clear and readable. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
