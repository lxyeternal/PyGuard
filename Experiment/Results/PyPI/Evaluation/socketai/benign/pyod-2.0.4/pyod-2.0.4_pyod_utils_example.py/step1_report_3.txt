  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for visualizing the results of anomaly detection models and synthetic data generation, mainly for debugging and presentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred, y_test_pred, and internally calls functions check_consistent_shape and get_outliers_inliers which read data for shape validation and outlier detection.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations via matplotlib's plotting functions and saves figures if specified. No data is sent over network or written to insecure locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to shape validation, outlier/inlier separation, and plotting functions. No untrusted data flows into insecure sinks like network or file writes outside matplotlib figure saving.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code relies on standard libraries and internal helper functions. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical visualization utility for machine learning model results. It checks data shape consistency, separates outliers/inliers, and generates plots. The only potentially sensitive operation is saving figures to disk, but this is a common practice and parameter-controlled. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. No external network activity, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility for machine learning results with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data plotting and saving operations without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
