  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for visualizing machine learning results and generated data, mainly for plotting inliers and outliers in datasets and model predictions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred, y_test_pred) and configuration parameters for plotting and saving figures.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib to generate plots and save images; no other sinks such as network or file access are present.",
  "flows": "Data is passed from input parameters into visualization functions, processed to identify inliers/outliers, then plotted with matplotlib. No untrusted data flow to system outside plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious data handling. Uses only standard visualization libraries and data processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, performs shape checks, and visualizes datasets and predictions. The data validation relies on external functions check_consistent_shape and get_outliers_inliers, which are assumed to be safe. The code enforces 2D data for visualization. There are no network operations, code injections, or data leaks observed. The plotting functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for data visualization in machine learning workflows. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It operates solely on provided data and produces visual outputs. No security risks or malware are detected.",
