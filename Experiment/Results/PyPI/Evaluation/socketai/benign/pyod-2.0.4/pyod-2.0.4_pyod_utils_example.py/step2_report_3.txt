  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the associated scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a benign visualization utility.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are mentioned.\n- The code relies on standard libraries, performs shape validation, and visualizes data with no external network or data exfiltration.\n- The only potentially sensitive operation is saving figures, which is optional and controlled via parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes visualization functions with shape validation and outlier detection.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; code is standard plotting and validation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focused on plotting inliers/outliers.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility for anomaly detection visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward visualization; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Visualizing inliers/outliers, standard plotting.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no external network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar visualization utility.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n**However,** given the nature of the code—primarily visualization functions—it's unlikely that any score should be higher than 0.5 unless there's an overlooked concern, which there isn't.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0** — No security risk.\n\n**Note:** The scores given in the reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and with no security risk. The code is a standard visualization utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores.",
