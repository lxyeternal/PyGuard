  "purpose": "Utility functions for visualizing datasets and model results in machine learning examples, including plotting inliers and outliers for training and test datasets.",
  "sources": "Input data parameters: X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred, y_test_pred; data validation functions check_consistent_shape and get_outliers_inliers.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions, file saving with plt.savefig, and data validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and processed to identify inliers and outliers; visualization functions generate plots based on this data; potential save to disk occurs if save_figure is True.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external connections detected. The code uses standard data visualization and validation libraries without obfuscated or misleading constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for visualizing datasets and model predictions. It imports standard libraries, performs shape validation, and generates plots with no data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are evident. Functions are internally scoped, and the code uses common practices for plotting. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious intent. The only potential concern is file saving, but it is optional and handled safely with user-specified filenames. Overall, the code appears benign, with no security threats identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility for ML datasets and results, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
