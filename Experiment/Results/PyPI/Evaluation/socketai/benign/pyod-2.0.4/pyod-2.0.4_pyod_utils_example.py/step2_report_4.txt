  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose:**\n   - The code provides visualization utilities for ML datasets and model results, including plotting inliers and outliers.\n   - It uses standard libraries (`matplotlib`) and external helper functions (`check_consistent_shape`, `get_outliers_inliers`).\n   - No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with optional file saving.\n\n2. **Security Concerns and Anomalies:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external connections.\n   - No obfuscated or malicious code patterns.\n   - The only potentially sensitive operation is saving figures, which is optional and controlled via parameters.\n   - Use of `assert` statements to limit the number of clusters in `data_visualize` is benign but slightly restrictive.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as benign, standard visualization functions with no malicious behavior.\n   - They mention the reliance on external functions for shape validation and outlier detection, which are assumed safe.\n   - No suspicious external dependencies or behaviors are identified.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and malware/security risk scores are 0.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware or malicious intent detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified; optional file saving is safe if used properly.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor concern is the `plt.savefig()` call without a filename in `data_visualize`. But this is controlled via `save_figure` parameter, and the filename is provided in `visualize`. Since it's optional and standard, it doesn't elevate risk.\n   - The shape validation enforces 2D data, which is typical for visualization; no security concern here.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign visualization utility.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe and standard for visualization purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign visualization utility with no malicious or security-compromising features. The existing scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
