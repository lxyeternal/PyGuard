  "purpose": "Utility functions for visualizing datasets and model results in machine learning examples, specifically for outlier detection and clustering visualizations.",
  "sources": "Imports data functions check_consistent_shape and get_outliers_inliers from the same package. Reads input data (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred, y_test_pred). Uses matplotlib for plotting, which is a standard visualization library.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions that display or save figures. No untrusted data handling or network operations. No data leaks or code execution from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked for shape consistency, then processed to extract inliers and outliers, and finally visualized via plotting functions. Data flows from parameters through helper functions to visualization routines.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. Usage of standard libraries and well-defined helper functions. No dynamic code execution, no file manipulations beyond plotting.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for data visualization, with functions to plot inliers and outliers from datasets. It includes shape checks, data processing via imported functions, and plotting with Matplotlib. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior detected. It handles only visualization tasks with benign intentions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard visualization utility functions for machine learning datasets and model results. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The code does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
