{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for visualizing datasets and model results in machine learning examples, specifically for outlier detection scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, y_train_pred, y_test_pred), and uses internal functions check_consistent_shape and get_outliers_inliers.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib.pyplot for plotting; potential risk if plotting functions process untrusted data, but no direct data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal functions for shape validation and outlier detection, then into plotting routines to visualize the data and predictions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network communications, and no obfuscated code. Use of standard plotting functions with controlled data. Assert statement limits to 5 clusters for visualization; harmless but slightly restrictive.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward visualization utility for ML datasets and results. It checks data shape consistency, segregates inliers and outliers, and plots them accordingly. No external network or file access beyond saving figures is performed. No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious behavior are observed. The internal functions perform data validation and extraction, and plotting is based solely on input data. The code contains only benign data visualization logic with standard libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for visualizing machine learning results with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It safely handles data and produces visual outputs without external communications or data leakage mechanisms.",
