  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of the SOS anomaly detection method. It shows no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified based on the code's content and behavior."
