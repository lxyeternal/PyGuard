  "purpose": "Implement the Stochastic Outlier Selection (SOS) anomaly detection algorithm for identifying outliers in datasets using affinity and perplexity measures.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through check_array and _x2d methods, computes dissimilarity matrices, affinity matrices, and decision scores. No external untrusted input sources are explicitly used beyond standard data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Returns decision scores and anomaly scores; no data is sent over the network or written to files. Uses _process_decision_scores() which is not defined here, but presumably processes scores internally.",
  "flows": "Input data -> check_array -> _x2d -> _d2a -> _a2b -> _b2o -> decision scores; for prediction, the same flow occurs with new data in decision_function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The only potentially concerning aspect is the reliance on the _process_decision_scores() method, but without its implementation, this is not necessarily malicious. The code performs complex mathematical operations related to outlier detection, with no signs of data exfiltration or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-known statistical method for outlier detection based on affinity calculations. It employs standard numpy and scipy functions, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity. The presence of an import from a local .base module and method calls like _process_decision_scores() are typical in object-oriented Python code and do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOS with no embedded malicious or sabotage behavior. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No anomalies indicating malicious activity or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of the SOS outlier detection algorithm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate statistical anomaly detection techniques. The only uncertainty stems from the undefined method _process_decision_scores(), but it appears to be part of the inherited class and not suspicious.",
