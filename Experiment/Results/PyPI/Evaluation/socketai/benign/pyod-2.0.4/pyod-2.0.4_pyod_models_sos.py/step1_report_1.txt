  "purpose": "Implementation of the Stochastic Outlier Selection (SOS) algorithm for anomaly detection, based on affinity and perplexity measures.",
  "sources": "Reading input data via check_array, reading the distance matrix D, and possibly using the scipy.spatial.distance module for custom metrics.",
  "sinks": "Calculations on decision scores, affinity matrices, and outlier scores; no data is explicitly sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input data -> dissimilarity matrix calculation -> affinity computation -> outlier score derivation -> decision function output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external scipy.spatial.distance only if needed, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No suspicious or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears to implement a standard algorithm without hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of the SOS algorithm with methods for computing dissimilarity matrices, affinities, and outlier scores. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The usage of external scipy for distance metrics is legitimate and optional. The only external dependencies are numpy, numba, and sklearn, which are common in data science. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The flow follows a typical unsupervised outlier detection pipeline. The code computes outlier scores internally and provides a decision function, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an anomaly detection algorithm without any signs of malicious or sabotage activity. It relies on standard libraries and implements well-understood methods. No suspicious behaviors or backdoors are detected.",
