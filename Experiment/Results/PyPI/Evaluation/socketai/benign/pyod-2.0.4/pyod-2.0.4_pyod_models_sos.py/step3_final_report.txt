  "purpose": "Implementation of the Stochastic Outlier Selection (SOS) algorithm for anomaly detection, utilizing affinity and perplexity calculations to identify outliers.",
  "sources": "Input data X, dissimilarity matrix D computed from X, and internal parameters for affinity and perplexity calculations.",
  "sinks": "Decision scores stored in self.decision_scores_ used for outlier thresholding; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data -> dissimilarity matrix D -> affinity matrix A -> binding probabilities B -> outlier scores O -> thresholding for outlier detection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and methods; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard SOS anomaly detection algorithm with typical data processing steps, including distance computation, affinity calculation via binary search for perplexity, and outlier scoring. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident. The only external dependency is a local base class, which appears benign. The iterative perplexity adjustment and affinity calculations are standard in such algorithms. No external communication, data leakage, or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of the SOS anomaly detection method. It shows no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.1) are justified based on the code's content and behavior.",
