{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for generating, manipulating, and evaluating synthetic data for outlier detection tasks, including clustering, categorical, and mixed data.",
  "sources": "Functions read input parameters, generate data via numpy and sklearn, and check input validity. No external untrusted input sources are used within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications. Functions return data or raise exceptions based on input validation.",
  "flows": "Inputs are validated and then used to generate datasets via numpy and sklearn functions, with no external data being fetched or transmitted. The only data flow involves generating synthetic datasets and returning them.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with standard data generation and validation routines. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data handling, or malicious behaviors like network activity or system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data generation functions for testing outlier detection algorithms, with input validation, dataset creation, and evaluation. No code injections, system access, or external communications are present. The code relies on numpy, sklearn, and internal utility functions for validation but does not perform any suspicious operations. The functions are well-structured, with no obfuscated language features or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate utility functions intended for synthetic data creation and evaluation in machine learning contexts. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe for use in production environments focused on data simulation and testing.",
