{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating, manipulating, and evaluating synthetic datasets for outlier detection tasks, including clustering and categorical data simulation.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters for dataset sizes, contamination ratios, random seed values, and data generation configurations. These are used internally for data creation.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are limited to output datasets generated by functions, used for testing models. No external network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Sources such as parameter inputs and random seed initialization lead to data generation functions, which produce datasets returned to the caller. No external data or untrusted input is directly used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious system commands, are observed. The code relies solely on standard numpy and sklearn utilities for data generation. No obfuscation or hidden code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard data generation techniques from numpy and scikit-learn, with parameter checks and input validation to ensure proper usage. The functions generate synthetic data for testing outlier detection algorithms, including handling NaN and Inf values for robustness testing. No network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of data generation, validation, and evaluation functionalities. No malicious behaviors or sabotage indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for synthetic dataset creation used in outlier detection benchmarking. It contains no malicious or harmful logic, nor does it perform any covert activities. It is safe for use in data science workflows.",
