{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for generating, manipulating, and evaluating synthetic data for outlier detection and anomaly detection tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads data inputs from function parameters, including random seed initialization, and data generation functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated datasets; no sinks perform actions that could leak untrusted data or perform malicious activities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to data generation functions, which produce datasets; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden network operations. Functions primarily generate synthetic data using numpy and sklearn utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly focuses on synthetic data generation, including Gaussian and uniform distributions, and categorical data. It utilizes random states for reproducibility and checks input parameters for validity. No code injection, external network connections, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns detected. The functions return datasets for machine learning tasks without executing external commands or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard data utility code for synthetic dataset creation and evaluation in machine learning contexts. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. Its purpose is benign, supporting outlier detection research or testing.",
