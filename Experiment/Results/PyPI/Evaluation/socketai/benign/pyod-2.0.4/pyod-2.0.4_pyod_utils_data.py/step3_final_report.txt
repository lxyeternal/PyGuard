  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating and evaluating synthetic outlier detection datasets, including data creation, validation, and performance metrics.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for data generation functions, random state initialization, and internal validation checks.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file I/O; purely in-memory data processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> data generation functions -> output datasets and metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of numpy and sklearn utilities; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data generation, validation, and evaluation routines for synthetic datasets used in outlier detection. It employs standard libraries, with proper input validation and no external system calls. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The use of random states is standard for reproducibility. The code handles NaN and Inf values for robustness but does not perform any harmful operations. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The only minor concern is the conservative security risk score of 0.1 in one report, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for synthetic data creation and evaluation, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the slight security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
