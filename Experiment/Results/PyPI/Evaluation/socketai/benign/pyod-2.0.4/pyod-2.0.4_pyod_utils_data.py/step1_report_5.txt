{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating, manipulating, and evaluating synthetic datasets for outlier detection tasks, including cluster-based, categorical, and general data generation, as well as data consistency checks and evaluation printing.",
  "sources": "Data generation functions (`_generate_data`, `generate_data`, `generate_data_clusters`, `generate_data_categorical`) read random seed/number inputs, and generate synthetic data arrays and labels. User-provided parameters such as contamination levels and random seed influence data creation.",
  "sinks": "Generated data (`X`, `X_train`, `X_test`, `X_clusters`, etc.) are returned for downstream use; no direct sinks for untrusted data within the code. No external system calls, network communications, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (random seed, contamination levels, data sizes) flow into data generation functions. These influence internal random data creation. The generated data flows outward as arrays and labels for testing or training models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code uses standard libraries and functions for data synthesis. No obfuscated code, code injections, or unusual behavior is observed. Warning mechanisms and parameter checks are correctly implemented without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-defined functions for synthetic data generation, including handling of NaN and infinite values for robustness testing. It performs parameter validation and uses random states for reproducibility. No external communication, system modification, or malicious activity is evident. The functions focus solely on data creation and evaluation metrics, with proper input validation and warnings for deprecated behavior. There are no signs of embedded malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code’s purpose aligns with data simulation and evaluation, with no external or covert actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for data generation and evaluation. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It safely generates synthetic datasets for outlier detection tasks, with appropriate parameter validation and usage of standard libraries. Overall security risk is low.",
