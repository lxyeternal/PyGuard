  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string (__version__ = '2.0.4') accompanied by extensive comments about versioning standards and licensing.\n- There are no data flows, input handling, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is entirely benign, serving as package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** To provide package metadata, versioning, and licensing info.\n- **Sources:** The static assignment of `__version__`.\n- **Sinks:** None—no untrusted input or output.\n- **Flows:** Static assignment; no data flow involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; comments are standard and informative.\n- **Analysis:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and standard for package metadata.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **securityRisk:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n\n- **Any discrepancies or overestimations?**  \n  No. The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n- **Potential for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. There is no indication of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Your own estimate:**  \n  Given the code's nature, I would assign scores as follows:\n  - **malware:** 0  \n  - **obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **risk:** 0  \n\n- **Justification:**  \n  The code is purely metadata with no dynamic or external code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code's purpose is solely to define a version string with accompanying comments, and it poses no security threat.\n\n**Final note:** Always verify that no hidden code or external dependencies are introduced elsewhere; however, based on this snippet alone, the security assessment remains unchanged.",
