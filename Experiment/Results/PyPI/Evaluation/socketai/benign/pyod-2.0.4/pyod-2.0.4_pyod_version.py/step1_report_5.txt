  "purpose": "The code provides metadata and licensing information for the 'pyod' package, a Python toolbox for outlier detection.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string '__version__' and comments containing package information and licensing details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data output; no sensitive information handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code solely defines static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code consists of comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is comprised of comments describing package details, licensing, and versioning conventions, along with a single assignment of the version string. There are no functions, no data processing, no input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The static nature and lack of suspicious constructs indicate no malicious intent. The version string appears to follow semantic versioning standards without obfuscation or hidden data.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains only metadata and licensing comments with a straightforward version assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
