  "purpose": "Document the versioning and licensing information of the pyod package, and provide metadata about the release.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable assignment and comments regarding package licensing, release markers, and formatting standards.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: comments and a version variable assignment with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The comments and version string are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
