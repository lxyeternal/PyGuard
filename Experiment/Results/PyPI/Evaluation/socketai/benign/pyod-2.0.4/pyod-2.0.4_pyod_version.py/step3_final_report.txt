{
  "purpose": "The code serves as package metadata, defining the version of the 'pyod' library and providing licensing and versioning information through comments.",
  "sources": "The static assignment of __version__ = '2.0.4'",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations",
  "flows": "Direct static assignment; no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; comments are standard, and the version string is static and well-formed",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and a single static variable assignment with no dynamic or external code. It does not read input, write output, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The comments are standard documentation about versioning and licensing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
