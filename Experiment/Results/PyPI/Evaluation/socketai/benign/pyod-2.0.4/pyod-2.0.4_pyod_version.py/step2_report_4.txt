  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string (`__version__ = '2.0.4'`) accompanied by extensive comments explaining versioning standards, licensing, and package metadata.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, input/output handling, external calls, or code constructs that could be malicious or suspicious.\n   - The comments are standard and reference common versioning and licensing practices.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - The code is purely informational, serving as metadata for the package.\n   - No untrusted input is processed, no external data is fetched, and no code execution occurs.\n   - The comments do not contain any suspicious or obfuscated content.\n   - The version string is static and standard.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation:**\n   - Malware score: 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The risk score is also 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1 across all reports, reflecting certainty about the benign status.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n6. **Any assumptions or claims?**\n   - The reports correctly assume that the code is purely metadata with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions are made about hidden behavior, as none exists.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign package metadata snippet.\n   - The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n   - No modifications or re-scoring are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign, serving only as package metadata with no security concerns.",
