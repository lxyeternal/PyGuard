  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code contains only comments describing versioning, licensing, and conventions.\n- It assigns a static string `'2.0.4'` to the variable `__version__`.\n- There are no dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or suspicious constructs.\n- The comments are standard and provide no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, containing only comments and a straightforward version assignment. There are no issues or vulnerabilities present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, metadata, and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`. These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5. This is correct.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All claims are grounded in the actual code content, which is non-malicious.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is purely metadata with no executable or suspicious content.\n- The comments are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The version string is static and follows semantic versioning, with no signs of dynamic or hidden code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is entirely benign, serving as a simple metadata declaration for the package.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
