  "purpose": "Provide information about the pyod library, including its versioning and licensing details.",
  "sources": "The code reads the string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "The version string could potentially be used in logging or display, but no untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code simply assigns a static version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and consists of comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments describing the library and a single assignment statement for the version. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no data processing, or network interactions. The comments explain versioning conventions and licensing but do not include any suspicious or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for the library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
