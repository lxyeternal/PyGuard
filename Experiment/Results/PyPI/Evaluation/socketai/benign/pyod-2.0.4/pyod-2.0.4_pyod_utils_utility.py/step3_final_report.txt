  "purpose": "A collection of utility functions supporting outlier detection, including data validation, normalization, score thresholding, list operations, and index sampling.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays for validation and normalization; score arrays for thresholding; list inputs for set operations; random state for sampling.",
  "sinks": "Threshold calculations for outlier labeling; list set operations; index sampling functions that generate indices based on random states.",
  "flows": "Input data → validation and normalization functions; scores → thresholding in score_to_label; list inputs → get_list_diff, get_diff_elements, get_intersection; random state → generate_indices, generate_bagging_indices.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out version check for sklearn (benign); no other anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module for outlier detection workflows, employing numpy and sklearn for data validation, normalization, score processing, and sampling. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The functions perform straightforward, well-documented operations, with input validation and no obfuscation. The commented-out version check is harmless. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility library for outlier detection tasks. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage detected. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score should be minimal (~0.1), reflecting the safe, standard nature of the code.",
