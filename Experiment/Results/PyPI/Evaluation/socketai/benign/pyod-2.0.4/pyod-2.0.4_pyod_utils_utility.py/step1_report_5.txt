{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for outlier detection, data normalization, score conversion, list operations, and index generation, primarily supporting anomaly detection workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as numpy arrays, lists, or scalar values; no external untrusted data sources are directly accessed within the functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that perform data normalization (scaler.transform), percentile calculations, and list/set operations. No network, file, or system command operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., scores, data arrays) through functions like score_to_label or check_parameter, leading to outputs like labels or normalized data. No malicious flow patterns are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. The code adheres to standard utility patterns. Some commented-out code and version check functions are present but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of utility functions for data validation, normalization, list/set operations, and index sampling. It employs standard Python and scikit-learn functions without suspicious behaviors. There are no network communications, file manipulations, or system-level commands. Functions like check_parameter and check_detector perform validation. Score conversion functions (score_to_label, precision_n_scores) operate on input scores without external data leaks or malicious code. List operations are straightforward set-based computations. Index generation functions use numpy and scikit-learn utilities securely. The code appears intended solely for data processing in anomaly detection contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for outlier detection workflows with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code appears safe, standard, and intended for data manipulation and validation purposes.",
