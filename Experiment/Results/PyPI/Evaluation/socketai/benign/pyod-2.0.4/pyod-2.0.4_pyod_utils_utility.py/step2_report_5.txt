  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the presence of issues, logical flaws, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for outlier detection, normalization, validation.\n- No suspicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report correctly notes the absence of malicious activity.\n- The code performs standard validation and data processing.\n- No active network calls, system modifications, or obfuscation.\n- The commented-out version check for sklearn is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion that the code is benign and safe is accurate. The malware score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data validation, normalization, score processing.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The functions handle scores, labels, list operations securely.\n- No external data leaks, network activity, or code injections.\n- Comments and structure are typical for utility libraries.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is justified. Malware score should stay **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Utility functions for outlier detection, data validation, thresholding.\n- No suspicious patterns or code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code's operations are standard.\n- No network, file, or malicious system activity.\n- Functions like `check_parameter`, `score_to_label`, and list operations are safe.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is correct; malware score remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports, focusing on data validation, thresholding, index sampling.\n- No malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 1.0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The functions perform standard data processing.\n- No external communication or suspicious logic.\n- Comments and structure are typical.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified; malware score is **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Utility functions for outlier detection, data normalization, score conversion.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code uses numpy and sklearn safely.\n- No network, file, or system command activity.\n- Functions are straightforward and serve legitimate purposes.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; malware score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity detected.\n- The functions are standard, well-structured, and perform typical data validation and processing tasks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, sabotage, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a very low risk score is appropriate, e.g., **0.1** or **0.2** to reflect minimal inherent risk in utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard utility module for outlier detection tasks. No malicious or sabotage behavior is present, and the scores should reflect this assessment.",
