{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data preprocessing, parameter checking, score conversion, list operations, index generation, and histogram bin optimization, primarily supporting outlier detection workflows.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from function parameters such as X, X_t, pred_scores, y, y_pred, and random_state; these are used for normalization, scoring, list processing, and index sampling.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into threshold calculations, percentile-based score thresholds, label assignments, and index generation, but there are no evidence of data leakage, network communication, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Scores and data are processed through normalization, thresholding, label conversion, and index sampling functions, with internal calculations using percentile and numpy operations; no external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. All operations are standard for a data utility library. Comments and function structure are typical, with no hidden or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data validation, normalization, score-to-label conversion, list operations, index sampling, and bin optimization. Checks ensure parameters are within valid ranges. No network, file, or system modifications occur. There are no signs of malicious intent; all functions serve legitimate data processing roles. The use of external libraries (numpy, sklearn) is safe. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical utility library for outlier detection workflows with no malicious or maliciously intended code. It contains no evidence of malware or security risks. It appears safe for use in data analysis pipelines.",
