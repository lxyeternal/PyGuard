{
  "purpose": "A collection of utility functions to support outlier detection, data normalization, parameter checking, and other auxiliary tasks in anomaly detection workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays, lists, and parameters for function configurations (e.g., thresholds, fractions, indices).",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposes data or parameters to functions that could influence decision thresholds or computations; no direct external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked, normalized, and processed through statistical functions; thresholds and labels are computed internally without external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. All operations appear typical for utility functions in data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, normalization, threshold calculation, index generation, and utility operations related to outlier detection. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior evident. The functions are well-structured, and the logic aligns with standard data science and machine learning utility patterns. No signs of sabotage or malicious intent were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of utility functions for outlier detection with no malicious behavior. It performs standard operations like data normalization, thresholding, index sampling, and list operations, all consistent with data analysis tasks. No security risks or malware behaviors are present.",
