{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for outlier detection, data normalization, parameter checking, and auxiliary tasks in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments such as numpy arrays, lists, and parameters for functions like check_parameter, standardizer, score_to_label, get_label_n, and others.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data primarily for thresholding and comparison operations, such as in score_to_label and get_label_n functions, which convert scores into binary labels.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (scores, labels, features) through thresholding and sorting functions that produce binary labels or indices, but there are no suspicious data exfiltration or network communication flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The code is standard utility functions, with commented-out code and version checks that are benign. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for parameter validation, data standardization, thresholding, list operations, and index sampling. These functions perform straightforward operations like checking data types, normalizing data, converting scores into binary labels based on percentile thresholds, and sampling indices. No network operations, file I/O, or system commands are present. All operations are in line with common machine learning utility functions, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The functions are well-structured, with clear parameters and expected behaviors, and there are no indications of hidden or malicious code. The only minor point is the commented-out version check code, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard set of utility functions for outlier detection and data processing without any malicious behavior. It does not contain network communication, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is well-structured, and the logic is consistent with safe utility operations in data science workflows.",
