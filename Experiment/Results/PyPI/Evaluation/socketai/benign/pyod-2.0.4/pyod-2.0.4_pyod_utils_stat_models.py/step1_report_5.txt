{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for statistical analysis, including distance calculations, Pearson correlation, and empirical cumulative distribution functions, primarily intended for data analysis and modeling tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input matrices and arrays via function parameters such as X, Y, mat, w, and matrix. It also checks the shapes and types of these inputs using check_array and check_consistent_length.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful manner, such as network operations, file writes, or execution of external commands. The code performs calculations and data manipulations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input matrices and arrays through various computations, including distance metrics, correlations, and empirical distributions. There are no suspicious or unusual data flow patterns indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The commented-out code related to p-value calculation and the unused '_betai' function suggest incomplete or disabled features but not malicious intent. Usage of Numba for JIT compilation is standard for performance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard statistical functions using numpy, scipy, sklearn, and numba. It performs data validation, distance computations, correlation calculations, and empirical distribution evaluations. All functions operate solely on input data without side effects or external interactions. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is evident. The commented-out sections relate to p-value calculations but are disabled due to Python 2.7 compatibility, indicating maintenance rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library of statistical utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on provided data for analysis purposes. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this code segment.",
