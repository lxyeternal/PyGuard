  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on potential security concerns, malware indicators, obfuscation, and consistency of scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, performing standard statistical functions.\n- No suspicious data flows, external communications, or code injections are identified.\n- Commented-out code and TODOs relate to incomplete features or compatibility issues, not malicious intent.\n- Usage of standard libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn, numba) and validation routines (check_array, check_consistent_length) are typical for data analysis code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.\n- The code's purpose is solely statistical computation, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The commented-out sections related to p-value calculations and beta functions are benign development artifacts, not security concerns.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The only potential concern is the commented-out code, which could suggest incomplete features, but not malicious intent.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0. This is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is low. The minor mention of commented-out code and incomplete features does not elevate the risk.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No reason exists to assign a higher malware or obfuscation score.\n- The small security risk (0.1-0.2) seems reasonable, reflecting the incomplete features but no malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minor concerns due to incomplete features, but not security threats)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard statistical utility library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The small security risk score reflects minor incomplete features or comments, not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis provided.",
