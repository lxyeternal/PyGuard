  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is a collection of statistical utility functions.\n   - No report mentions any suspicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation.\n   - Commented-out code related to p-value calculations and beta functions appears to be incomplete or disabled, which is typical in development or maintenance artifacts, not malicious features.\n   - The code relies on standard libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn, numba) and performs mathematical/statistical operations on input data matrices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured and documented.\n   - The only potential concern is the commented-out p-value calculation, but this is explicitly marked as disabled due to Python 2.7 compatibility issues.\n   - No evident logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-documented code.\n   - The security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), indicating that the reviewers are certain about the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Given the consistent evidence, there is no reason to elevate the malware or security risk scores.\n   - The only reason to consider a slight increase could be the commented-out code, but since it is benign and explicitly disabled, it does not justify higher scores.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard statistical utility library with no malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected.\n   - The code is safe for use in data analysis contexts.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the commented-out code, but this is not a security concern)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
