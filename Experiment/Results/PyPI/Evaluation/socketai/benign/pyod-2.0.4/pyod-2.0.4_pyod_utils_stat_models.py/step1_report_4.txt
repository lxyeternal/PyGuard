{
  "purpose": "This code provides statistical utility functions for data analysis, including distance calculations, correlation metrics, and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF), intended for use in machine learning or data analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (X, Y, matrices, vectors), uses check_array for validation, and processes data within functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls are present. No evidence of untrusted data being transmitted or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Data is validated and processed internally within functions, with no external data flows or untrusted data handling beyond standard computations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are observed. Code appears standard and consistent with typical statistical utility implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains several functions for calculating distances, correlations, and empirical distributions. It uses established libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn, numba) and proper data validation routines. There are no indications of malicious logic such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. Comments and code structure are consistent with data processing purposes. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard set of statistical utilities with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe for use in data analysis tasks.",
