  "purpose": "A collection of statistical models and utility functions for distance calculations, correlation, and empirical cumulative distribution functions, intended for data analysis and statistical computations.",
  "sources": "Input data matrices and vectors provided as function parameters; data validation functions check_array and check_consistent_length validate input shapes.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; computations are performed internally on input data; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through validation, then into mathematical functions (distance, correlation, ECDF), with no external or untrusted data sources or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to p-value calculation and beta functions is present but inactive; no suspicious or malicious code segments identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard statistical utility functions using common libraries (numpy, scipy, sklearn, numba). No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The commented-out sections are benign development artifacts. Input validation is performed, and no external communication or side effects are present. The code is well-structured, documented, and focused solely on data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured statistical utility library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
