  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments based on the Tango style.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments Style and Token classes; class definition with style configurations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward style configuration with no dynamic execution, input handling, or secret management.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a static class 'FlaskyStyle' inheriting from 'Style', with style attributes and a styles dictionary mapping tokens to color and style strings. It contains no input/output, external calls, or data processing logic. The code appears to be a static resource for syntax highlighting. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static style definition for syntax highlighting, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
