{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class definition and style dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No data is processed or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "The code only defines a style class and does not process any input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The style definitions are straightforward and do not contain any suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for styling, defines a subclass of Style with specific color and style mappings for syntax tokens. The mappings specify colors and font styles for various token types, consistent with styling themes. There are no dynamic code execution, external network connections, or handling of untrusted data. The code appears to serve a purely aesthetic purpose with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign style configuration for syntax highlighting in Pygments. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
