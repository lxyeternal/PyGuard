  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library, specifically themed around a 'flasky' tango style.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pygments.style' and 'pygments.token', class definition of 'FlaskyStyle'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle user input, external data, or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely defining a style class with static attribute values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling components from the Pygments library and defines a subclass 'FlaskyStyle' with a specific set of style attributes mapped to various token types. All style properties are statically assigned string values representing CSS-like styles. There are no external inputs, no functions executing untrusted data, nor any obfuscated or dynamic code segments. The code is purely configuration for syntax highlighting styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, static style definition for the Pygments syntax highlighter, with no malicious behavior or security risks present. It does not process external data or execute code that could be malicious.",
