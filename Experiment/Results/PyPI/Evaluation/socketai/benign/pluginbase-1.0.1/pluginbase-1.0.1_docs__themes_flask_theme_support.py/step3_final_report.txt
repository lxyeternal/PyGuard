  "purpose": "Static style definition for Pygments syntax highlighting, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only defines style classes and style mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely declarative style mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward static style definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class defining syntax highlighting styles for Pygments. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The style strings are simple CSS-like style definitions. No secrets, credentials, or external data are processed. The code's structure and content are consistent with benign static configuration. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for syntax highlighting with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its static nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
