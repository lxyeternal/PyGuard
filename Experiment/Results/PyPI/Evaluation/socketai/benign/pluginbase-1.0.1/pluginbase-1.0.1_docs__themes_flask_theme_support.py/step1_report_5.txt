  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on the Tango style.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pygments.style and pygments.token; class definition for FlaskyStyle with style attributes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute code based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks indicative of malicious activity; style definitions are static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; all code is static and solely for styling purposes. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Pygments, then defines a subclass of Style with static style attributes for syntax highlighting. No user input, network operations, file I/O, or other dynamic behavior is present. The style definitions are hardcoded CSS-like strings for various token types, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Overall, the code is straightforward and purely stylistic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static style definition for syntax highlighting, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to serve purely aesthetic purposes without security risks.",
