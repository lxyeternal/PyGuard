{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library based on Tango style, intended for use in a Flask-based application.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules; class definition setting style attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input or output points; static style definitions only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code purely defines static style parameters for syntax highlighting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling modules, then defines a class with static attributes specifying color schemes and text styles for various syntax tokens. It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or handle data in a way that could lead to security issues. There are no obfuscated code constructs, malicious network activity, or data leaks. The structure is straightforward, consistent with standard styling definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign configuration for syntax highlighting styling. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe to use.",
