  "purpose": "Load plugins dynamically from a specified directory using pluginbase",
  "sources": "Reading plugin names ('hello') and search path ('./plugins')",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing or importing untrusted plugin code",
  "flows": "Loading 'hello' plugin from './plugins' directory",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes the pluginbase library to dynamically load plugins from a local directory. It sets a package context and specifies a search path. The only plugin loaded is 'hello'. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The comment indicates that the 'hello' plugin object will be collected upon interpreter shutdown, which is standard behavior. The code itself does not perform any unsafe operations or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward plugin loader setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external plugin code, which should be reviewed separately for security, but the loader itself appears safe.",
