  "purpose": "Load a plugin named 'hello' from the './plugins' directory using pluginbase.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it loads a plugin from a fixed path and name.",
  "sinks": "The loaded plugin code executes when loaded; if malicious, it could perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code loads the plugin 'hello' from './plugins' and assigns it to 'hello'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward plugin loading with no validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple plugin loader that imports 'pluginbase', creates a plugin source from a specified package and search path, and loads a plugin named 'hello'. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or validation mechanisms. The primary risk stems from the trustworthiness of the external plugin 'hello' in './plugins'. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The security risk varies from 0.1 to 0.4 depending on environment trust assumptions, which is reasonable given the external dependency. The code itself is safe, but external plugins could be malicious if compromised. Implementing validation, signature verification, or sandboxing would mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe plugin loader with no malicious or obfuscated content. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins, not the loader code itself. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; the security risk score should be around 0.2 to reflect external supply chain risk.",
