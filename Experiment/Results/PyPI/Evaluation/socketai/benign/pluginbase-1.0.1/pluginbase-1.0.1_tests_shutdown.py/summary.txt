  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe plugin loader with no malicious or obfuscated content. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins, not the loader code itself. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; the security risk score should be around 0.2 to reflect external supply chain risk."
