  "purpose": "Unit tests for plugin system, verifying plugin loading and resource handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads resource files 'hello.txt' and 'missingfile.txt' using source.open_resource().",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; however, resource files are opened and read, potentially from user-controlled directories.",
  "flows": "source.open_resource() reads files from specified paths; no untrusted input flows into dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of 'pytest' for testing is standard. No unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two test functions: one tests plugin app name retrieval, the other tests resource file opening and error handling. The resource paths are within './plugins', and the file contents are read for verification. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling observed. The code appears straightforward and intended for testing plugin functionality. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for plugin resource handling with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected.",
