{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying plugin loading and resource file reading functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading resource files ('hello.txt', 'missingfile.txt') from the filesystem, accessing plugin attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Resource file reads and plugin attribute access, limited to local filesystem operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code using pytest, involving plugin loading and resource file reading with proper exception handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The resource files are static, and the code does not process untrusted input. All signals indicate benign, standard testing procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to resource file access in a controlled environment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
