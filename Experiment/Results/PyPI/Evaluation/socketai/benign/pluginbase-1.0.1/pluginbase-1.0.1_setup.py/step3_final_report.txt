  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pluginbase' Python package, configuring package metadata and extracting version info.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description; reads 'pluginbase.py' to extract __version__ via regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external system interactions; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> applies regex to extract version -> passes data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for version extraction could be fragile if 'pluginbase.py' is altered, but this is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with file reads and regex parsing for version info. It handles missing files gracefully and uses well-known libraries. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The regex pattern assumes a specific format but is common. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe package setup configuration with no malicious or security issues. The minor concern about regex fragility does not constitute a security risk. The overall assessment confirms the code is benign and well-structured.",
