  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious activity or security issues detected.\n- The only technical point of note is the regex used to extract the version from 'pluginbase.py'. This is a common practice but could be fragile if the file content is maliciously altered. However, this is not inherently malicious.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or obfuscated code, network activity, or data leaks.\n- The code handles missing files gracefully, with no hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware.\n- The version extraction via regex is standard but could be fragile if 'pluginbase.py' is tampered with, but this is not a security concern per se.\n- No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident in the code.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The only minor concern is the potential fragility of regex parsing, but it is a common pattern and not a security risk.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which is justified given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Note on the last report:** It assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which is slightly higher than others, but still very low. Given the absence of any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, I agree with this low score.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, justified by the regex version parsing, which could be slightly fragile but not risky.\n\n**Justification for the risk score:** The only potential concern is the regex parsing, which could break if 'pluginbase.py' is maliciously altered, but it does not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all observations are based on code analysis.\n- The code is standard for a setup script and appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                                                                 |\n|----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**        | No malicious activity or payloads detected.                                                 |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**        | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.                                             |\n| Security Risk  | **0.1**      | Very low risk due to regex parsing; no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.       |\n\n**Overall, the package setup script is safe, standard, and free of security issues.**",
