      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured plugin management framework that employs common techniques such as import hooks, dynamic module creation, and resource handling. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The primary security concern is the powerful import hook which, if misused or if plugin sources are compromised, could be exploited. Overall, it is a benign implementation with typical risks associated with plugin systems."

The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins, not the loader code itself. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; the security risk score should be around 0.2 to reflect external supply chain risk."

The scores should reflect a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score around 0.1, consistent with the minimal inherent risks of plugin handling."

      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign test harness that imports an external 'shutdown' module. Its security risk depends on the trustworthiness of that module. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present in the code itself. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (~0.1) and moderate external dependency risk (~0.3)."
