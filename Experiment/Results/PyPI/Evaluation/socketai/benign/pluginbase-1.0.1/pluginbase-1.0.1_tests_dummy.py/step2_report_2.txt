  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a single comment line, serving as a placeholder or development note.\n- No executable code, data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity are indicated.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Malware scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the lack of executable or data-handling code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only a comment.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are present in such trivial placeholder comments.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are reasonable.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- Since the code is just a comment, any higher risk scores would be unjustified.\n- The notes correctly emphasize the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Score adjustments:** None needed; current scores are appropriate.\n- **Potential future considerations:** If in the future, such comments are replaced with actual code, re-evaluate for vulnerabilities, malware, and obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or complex constructs)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in a comment)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Given the extremely minimal content, there's no concern for supply chain security issues here. All evaluations align with the code's simplicity.",
