  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippets are simple comments with no executable code, data sources, sinks, or flows.\n   - No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is benign, serving as placeholders or development notes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the snippets are just comments with no security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: comments do not pose security risks unless they contain malicious instructions, which they do not here.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - Since there's no executable code, data flow, or suspicious content, the overall risk remains negligible.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly indicate `malware`: 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious activity or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign comments.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the nature of the code, the minimal risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (No obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risk, as it's just a comment)\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\nConsidering all the reports and the code content:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippets are harmless comments serving as placeholders or notes. They do not pose any security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The overall assessment aligns with a benign, non-malicious, and low-risk status.",
