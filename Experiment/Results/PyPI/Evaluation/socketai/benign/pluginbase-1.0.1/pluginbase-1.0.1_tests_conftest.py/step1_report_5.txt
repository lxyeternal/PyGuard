  "purpose": "Set up fixtures for testing plugin-based functionality using pytest and pluginbase.",
  "sources": "Import statements (gc, pytest, PluginBase), pytest fixture functions, and pluginbase method calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data flows to external systems or insecure locations.",
  "flows": "Fixtures provide configured objects for tests, no untrusted data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is standard test setup with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a plugin management library, then defines pytest fixtures for plugin source setup and garbage collection management. All code appears to be conventional test setup code with no external data inputs, no data leaks, and no suspicious code behavior. No code injection, malicious backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The code's structure and purpose are straightforward and typical for testing plugin systems.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely prepares test fixtures for plugin management and garbage collection within a testing framework, with no suspicious or malicious code elements.",
