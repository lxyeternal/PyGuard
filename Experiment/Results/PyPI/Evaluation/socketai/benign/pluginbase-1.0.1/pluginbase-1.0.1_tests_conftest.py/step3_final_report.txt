  "purpose": "Setup for testing plugin system using pytest fixtures, managing plugin source creation, internal namespace referencing, and garbage collection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for gc, pytest, and pluginbase; internal namespace string variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output, no network or file operations, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "Fixtures create plugin source and internal namespace reference; gc.collect() invoked before and after tests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal/private namespace string ('pluginbase._internalspace...') which could be risky if misused but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward testing setup with no external data handling, network activity, or malicious code. The internal namespace string access is unusual but not inherently malicious; it might pose a minor security concern if misused. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The use of gc.collect() is atypical but benign in this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing fixture setup with a minor concern regarding internal namespace access. The scores are accurate, and no significant security risks are present. The internal namespace string access warrants a very low security concern but does not constitute malicious activity.",
