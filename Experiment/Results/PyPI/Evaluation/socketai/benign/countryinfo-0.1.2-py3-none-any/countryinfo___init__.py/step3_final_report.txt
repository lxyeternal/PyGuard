{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'CountryInfo' class from the 'countryinfo.countryinfo' package, likely for geographic data processing.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the 'countryinfo' package during module load.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic, data handling, or network activity. The 'countryinfo' package is a known open-source geographic data library, not associated with malicious behavior. The import alone does not introduce any security risk or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code's simplicity indicates a low security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious activity or security issues. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture is very low risk.",
