  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\nAll reports describe the same minimal code: an import statement importing `CountryInfo` from `countryinfo.countryinfo`. There is no other code, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n- The code is a standard import statement, common in Python projects.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- No data flows, inputs, or outputs are present in these snippets.\n- The `countryinfo` package is a publicly available, open-source library for geographic data, not known for malicious activity.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- The reports' reasoning is consistent: simple import statements, no suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n- `malware`: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- `securityRisk`: Very low (0.1 or 0), consistent with the absence of suspicious activity.\n- `obfuscated`: 0, as the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.\n- `confidence`: High (around 0.9 to 1), since the analysis correctly identifies the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that import statements are harmless, which is generally true unless combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or exploits are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code snippets.\n- Since the code is only an import statement, there is no immediate security concern.\n- If these snippets are part of a larger project, further review would be necessary, but based solely on these, the risk is negligible.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but given the reports, 0.1 is acceptable for very minimal risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided snippets. The overall security posture here is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
