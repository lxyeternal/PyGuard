{
  "purpose": "The code imports the CountryInfo class from the countryinfo.countryinfo package, likely to retrieve or process information about countries.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the 'countryinfo' package when the module is loaded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement (source) to any subsequent use of the CountryInfo class (not shown), but within this snippet, no data flows are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements. The import appears standard for a package intended to provide country data.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only includes an import statement. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or network operations. Given the limited content, there's no evidence of malicious activity. The imported package, 'countryinfo', is a publicly available package designed for country data, not inherently suspicious. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code simply imports a legitimate package to access country information. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are very low.",
