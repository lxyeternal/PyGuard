{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class to access and retrieve information about countries from local JSON files, mainly for data lookup and display purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads country data from JSON files located in a 'data/' directory relative to the script's location.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems such as network, files, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON data from local files during initialization; data is retrieved from in-memory dictionaries upon method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code's structure is straightforward and consistent with data access. No obfuscated or unusual language features. The only notable aspect is reliance on local JSON files, which could be manipulated if files are tampered, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes by loading multiple country JSON files into a dictionary for quick access. It offers various methods to retrieve country information, all based on local data without executing external code or commands. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard data access logic, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. Potential security considerations include ensuring the integrity of the local JSON files, but this does not constitute malicious behavior.\n\nOverall, the code is a safe, data-centric utility with no malicious features present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious data lookup utility for country information from local JSON files. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The design and implementation are standard and safe.",
