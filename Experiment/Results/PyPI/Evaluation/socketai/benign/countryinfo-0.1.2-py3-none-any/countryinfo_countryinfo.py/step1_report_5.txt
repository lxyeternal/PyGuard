  "purpose": "A Python class for accessing and retrieving detailed information about countries from local JSON data files.",
  "sources": "Reads country data JSON files located in a data directory relative to the script location, during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "Returns data such as country info, ISO codes, borders, and other properties; does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading JSON files during object initialization into internal dictionaries, then into various getter methods returning specific data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code is a straightforward data loader and accessor with no obfuscated elements or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script loads country data from local JSON files into a dictionary during object creation. Each method provides access to specific properties of the country, such as name, borders, ISO codes, etc. The class handles missing data gracefully with try-except blocks or default returns. There are no external network connections, no execution of untrusted code, and no data exfiltration or malicious activity detected. The code structure is simple and primarily focused on data access, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data access class that loads local country data and provides getter methods. There are no indications of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for country information retrieval.",
