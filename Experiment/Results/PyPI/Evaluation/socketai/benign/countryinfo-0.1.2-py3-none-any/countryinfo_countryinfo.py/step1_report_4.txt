{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for accessing detailed country information from local JSON data files, allowing users to retrieve various country attributes such as name, borders, languages, etc.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files from a local data directory during class initialization; loads data into internal dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs of untrusted data are present; the code primarily reads from local files and returns data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON files through the loading process into internal data structures, then to method return values upon request.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of exception handling for missing keys appears standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads country information from local JSON files located in a 'data' directory relative to the script. It provides numerous getter methods to access specific attributes of a country. The data is loaded once at class instantiation and stored in a dictionary, then accessed via methods. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input beyond reading local files, and no operations that would suggest malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward and safe, designed solely for data retrieval from local files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a data access utility for country information stored locally. It contains no malicious behavior, no network activity, and no signs of sabotage. It appears to be a benign, well-structured data retrieval class with no security risks.",
