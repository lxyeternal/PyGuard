{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class to access detailed country information from local JSON files stored in a 'data' directory.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files from the filesystem within the 'data' directory, particularly in the constructor during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "Returns country information via class methods; no direct output sinks or data exfiltration points are present. No network or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON data from files during initialization, then provides access to specific data fields through class methods based on the country name input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are observed. The code mainly reads local JSON files and returns data.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by loading country data from local JSON files into a dictionary. It provides numerous accessor methods to retrieve country properties. There are no apparent inputs from untrusted sources at runtime, no network communication, nor any dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward data accessor with no malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. All data reads are local, and the output is standard data retrieval from stored JSON files.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a data access layer for country information stored locally. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code is safe in the context of cybersecurity review, assuming the JSON data files are secure and trustworthy. No malicious intent or sabotage detected.",
