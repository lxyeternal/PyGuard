{
  "purpose": "To provide access to country information stored in local JSON files, enabling retrieval of various country attributes.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files from the local 'data' directory during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not send data externally or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Loading JSON files into internal dictionary; getter methods access data from this dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No obfuscated or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads multiple JSON files from a local directory, storing country data in a dictionary keyed by country name. It provides numerous getter methods to access specific attributes such as ISO codes, borders, population, etc. There is no network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The code relies on external data files, which could be tampered with, but this is a data integrity concern, not a security flaw. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and functions solely as a data accessor.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a straightforward data loader for country information stored locally. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, primarily considering potential data integrity issues with local files, but not malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, and malicious signals. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
