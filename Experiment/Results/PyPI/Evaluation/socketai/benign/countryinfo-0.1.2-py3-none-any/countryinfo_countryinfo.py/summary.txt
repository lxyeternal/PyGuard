  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is a straightforward data loader for country information stored locally. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, primarily considering potential data integrity issues with local files, but not malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malware, obfuscation, and malicious signals. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior."
