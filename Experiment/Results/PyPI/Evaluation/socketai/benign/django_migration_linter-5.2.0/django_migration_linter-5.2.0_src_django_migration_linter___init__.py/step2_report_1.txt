  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code only contains import statements with no malicious behavior or data handling. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Score review:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk is 0.2; perhaps slightly elevated due to the use of 'import *', which can cause namespace pollution, but not inherently risky.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign; no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The confidence is 0.8, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, just import statements, no data flows or external interactions.\n- **Score review:** Malware score is 0, consistent. Security risk is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern over wildcard imports.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, only import statements, including a future import for annotations.\n- **Score review:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, as no external or suspicious activity is detected.\n- **Justification:** Standard package module import pattern, no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—import statements only.\n- **Score review:** Malware score 0, security risk 0. Matches the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity inferred.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Imports modules that could potentially execute code upon import, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone.\n- **Score review:** Malware score is 0, which might be optimistic if the imported modules execute code during import. Security risk is 0.2, considering the use of 'import *' which can obscure malicious code in imported modules.\n- **Justification:** Without inspecting the imported modules, it's impossible to confirm malicious activity. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, but the malware score should perhaps be higher if the imported modules are untrusted or unknown.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily import statements with no direct malicious activity visible.\n- The use of `import *` is consistently flagged as a code quality concern but not malicious.\n- The main potential risk lies in the imported modules themselves, which are not provided for review.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Should remain at 0 unless there's evidence that the imported modules contain malicious code. Since the modules are internal (`.migration_linter`, `.operations`), and no suspicious patterns are detected, malware scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.1–0.2) due to wildcard imports, which can obscure malicious code if present in the modules.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly at 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Overall:** The code snippet itself is benign; the main concern is the content of the imported modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **My estimate for malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code in this snippet)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with potential namespace pollution, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard module import code with no signs of malicious activity. The main concern is the imported modules' content, which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned are reasonable, but vigilance should be maintained if the imported modules are from untrusted sources.",
