  "purpose": "This code imports modules necessary for the package's functionality, specifically 'migration_linter' and 'operations'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module files '.migration_linter' and '.operations' during import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statements; there are no data flows or external interactions in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, but no malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, including a future import for annotations. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation is detected. The use of 'import *' is a code quality concern but not malicious. The imported modules could contain malicious code, but this cannot be assessed here. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of evidence. The security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential risk of namespace pollution. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer with imports. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The main concern relates to the imported modules' content, which cannot be evaluated here. The scores are appropriate given the context.",
