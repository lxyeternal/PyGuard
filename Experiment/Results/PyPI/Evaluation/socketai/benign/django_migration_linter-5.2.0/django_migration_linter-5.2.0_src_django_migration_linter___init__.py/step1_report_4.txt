{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports all functions and classes from two other modules: migration_linter and operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and relative imports from migration_linter and operations modules.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*), which can obscure what is imported but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, primarily performing imports from internal modules. It uses future annotations for compatibility. The wildcard imports could be considered a code quality concern but do not indicate malicious behavior. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. Overall, it appears to be standard module import code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module aggregator via imports. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
