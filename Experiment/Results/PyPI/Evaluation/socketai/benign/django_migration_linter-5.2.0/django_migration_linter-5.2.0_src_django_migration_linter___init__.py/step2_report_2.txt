  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code snippet:\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nfrom .migration_linter import *  # noqa\nfrom .operations import *  # noqa\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code only contains import statements; no data processing, network activity, or other logic.\n- Use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and reduced code clarity, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this fragment.\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior; straightforward imports.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2 (low), Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The confidence is 0.8, which aligns with the assessment. No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1; no suspicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly lower security risk, which makes sense. Confidence is high (0.9). No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard package import pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully reasonable. Confidence = 1. No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. Confidence is high (0.9). No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The only concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if the imported modules are malicious.\n- **Potential risk:** If the modules `migration_linter` or `operations` are malicious or compromised, they could execute malicious code upon import.\n- **However:** The code snippet itself does not contain malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly notes that the risk depends on the content of the imported modules, which cannot be determined here.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate given the limited information. The security risk is low but non-zero due to the use of wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the potential danger of importing modules with `import *`.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which could potentially import malicious code if the modules are compromised, but there's no evidence of this here.\n- For a more thorough security assessment, inspecting the contents of `migration_linter` and `operations` modules would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in this snippet)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to the use of wildcard imports, which could be exploited if the modules are malicious, but no evidence here)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe current scores are appropriate given the limited information. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be avoided or reviewed in the context of the imported modules. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present in this code fragment.",
