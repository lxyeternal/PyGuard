{
  "purpose": "Import modules related to database migration and operations, likely for a larger application framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ for compatibility, and relative imports from migration_linter and operations modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow detected; the code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from __future__ import annotations' is standard for Python 3.7+ and not suspicious. Relative imports are typical in package structures. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, including a future import for annotations and relative imports for internal modules. No data reading, external network communication, or other potentially malicious activity present. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's init or module entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for modular Python packages. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
