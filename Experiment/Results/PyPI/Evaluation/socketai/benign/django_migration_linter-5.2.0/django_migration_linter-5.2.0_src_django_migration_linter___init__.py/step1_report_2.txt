{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports all components from two other modules: migration_linter and operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ (annotations), and all contents from .migration_linter and .operations modules",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data processing, external communication, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways identified; simply imports modules without any data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure the source of imported functions or variables, but this is common in Python package modules; no suspicious or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only involves importing modules using wildcard imports. It does not include any logic, data handling, or network activity. The absence of dynamic execution, input handling, or external calls indicates no malicious intent or security issues. The wildcard imports are a design choice but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply brings in functionality from other modules, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
