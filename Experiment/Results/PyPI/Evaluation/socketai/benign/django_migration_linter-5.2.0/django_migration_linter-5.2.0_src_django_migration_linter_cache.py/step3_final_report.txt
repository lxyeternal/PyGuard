  "purpose": "Provides a cache mechanism using pickle serialization, loading and saving data to disk.",
  "sources": "File read operations for loading data; potentially influenced parameters for filename construction.",
  "sinks": "pickle.load() deserializes data, which can execute arbitrary code if the pickle file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Data read from pickle file (source) flows into untrusted deserialization (sink), risking code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Direct use of pickle.load() without validation or sandboxing; filename based on external input without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a cache with load and save methods using pickle. The load() method unpickles data directly from a file, which is unsafe if the file is malicious or tampered with, as pickle can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. The filename is constructed from parameters that could be influenced externally, increasing the risk of path traversal or malicious file access. No validation, sandboxing, or security checks are present. The code itself contains no malicious code or obfuscation, but the use of pickle on untrusted data introduces a high security vulnerability. The malware score should be high due to the potential for code execution, and the security risk score should reflect this severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward but insecure due to untrusted unpickling, which can lead to remote code execution if the pickle file is malicious. No malicious code is embedded, but the design choice poses a significant security risk. The malware score should be approximately 0.8, and the risk score should be around 0.8 to 0.9, reflecting the high severity of this vulnerability.",
