  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward but insecure due to untrusted unpickling, which can lead to remote code execution if the pickle file is malicious. No malicious code is embedded, but the design choice poses a significant security risk. The malware score should be approximately 0.8, and the risk score should be around 0.8 to 0.9, reflecting the high severity of this vulnerability."
