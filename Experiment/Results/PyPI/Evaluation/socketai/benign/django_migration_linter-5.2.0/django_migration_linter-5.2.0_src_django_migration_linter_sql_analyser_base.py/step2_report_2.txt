  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a static analysis utility for SQL migration scripts, using regex pattern matching to identify schema changes like renaming, dropping, altering tables/columns, and adding constraints.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The code employs standard Python constructs: dataclasses, enums, regex, and straightforward logic.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The purpose aligns with schema validation or linting, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear; analyzing SQL statements for risky operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligns with a benign static analysis tool.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **reasonable**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malware. Regex-based checks are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with static analysis.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Regex is used for pattern matching.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same purpose.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors detected. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) might reflect cautiousness, but given the code's nature, it's still safe.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — **acceptable**, considering the potential fragility of regex parsing but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — **reasonable**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports, possibly reflecting the regex-based pattern matching approach, which could be fragile but not malicious. This is acceptable given the static analysis context.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The securityRisk could be kept at 0 for all, as there's no actual security vulnerability or malicious behavior.\n- The minor risk scores might reflect cautiousness about regex fragility, but not actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Summary**\n\n- **Code behavior:** Static pattern matching on SQL statements; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Scores:** Should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, with a very low or zero for security risk, unless there's a known vulnerability or malicious pattern.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | No obfuscation patterns present.                                              |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No security vulnerabilities or malicious activities identified.             |\n\n**Note:** The current scores in the reports are mostly appropriate; the slight securityRisk of 0.2 could be lowered to 0 for clarity, but it's not incorrect.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion,** all reports correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious. The scores are reasonable, with minor room for adjustment if desired.",
