  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a static analysis utility for SQL migration scripts, primarily using regex pattern matching.\n   - No report indicates any code that performs malicious actions such as executing external commands, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n   - They correctly identify that the code uses regex for SQL parsing, which could be fragile but is not malicious.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting the potential fragility of regex parsing but not actual security risks.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the code's content.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5; the code is a static analysis tool with no active or malicious components.\n   - The low scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there are no malicious patterns or behaviors detected.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the limitations of regex parsing but do not infer malicious intent.\n   - The overall analysis remains cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n   - The security risk scores are appropriately low, and malware scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n  *Justified: No malicious activity or payloads are present.*\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n  *Justified: The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.*\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2**  \n  *Justified: The only minor concern is regex fragility, which is typical for static analysis tools but does not pose security risks.*\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a static analysis utility for SQL migration scripts, employing regex pattern matching to flag schema changes. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal fragility concern, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and aligns with its intended purpose.**",
