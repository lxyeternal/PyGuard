  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes and functions for analyzing SQL migration scripts for potential issues and risks, including checks for table and column alterations, constraints, and other schema changes.",
  "sources": "Input is the list of SQL statement strings provided to the 'analyse' method, which are read to perform pattern matching and condition checks.",
  "sinks": "The code generates 'Issue' objects which are stored in lists such as errors, warnings, and ignored. These issues record potential problems found during analysis, but do not directly influence external systems or perform side effects.",
  "flows": "SQL statements are processed through checks defined in 'Check' objects, which use regex and pattern matching to identify specific schema modifications. Issues are created and logged accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward, focused on pattern matching, data encapsulation, and list management. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a SQL migration analysis tool that performs pattern matching to identify schema changes such as renaming, dropping, or altering tables and columns. It utilizes dataclasses for checks and issues, and provides mechanisms for updating checks and filtering results based on exclusion lists. The core functions involve regex searches and simple logical conditions. No external network or system manipulations are present. No suspicious data handling, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected. The code’s purpose is safety auditing and compliance checking of database migration scripts, with no indication of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SQL schema analysis utility focused on detecting specific schema modifications, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears well-structured for its purpose and does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is low.",
