  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for SQL migration scripts to detect schema changes such as renaming, dropping, altering tables/columns, and adding constraints using regex pattern matching.",
  "sources": "SQL statements provided as list of strings, read during analysis functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, send data over network, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "SQL statements are matched via regex patterns to identify specific schema operations; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward regex-based pattern matching; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static pattern matching on SQL statements to identify schema changes. It employs standard Python libraries, dataclasses, and enums. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. Regex patterns are used for pattern detection, which can be fragile but are not malicious. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. All reports correctly assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.2), which is justified given the code's static analysis purpose. No evidence suggests malicious intent or activity. The risk scores could be lowered to 0, but the current low risk reflects cautiousness about regex fragility, not actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static SQL migration analysis utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
