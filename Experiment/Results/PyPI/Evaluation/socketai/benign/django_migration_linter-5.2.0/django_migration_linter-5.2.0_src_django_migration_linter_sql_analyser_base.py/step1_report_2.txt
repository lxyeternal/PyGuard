{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of tools and classes for analyzing SQL migration scripts, checking for specific patterns, and reporting issues related to schema changes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'sql_statements' list parameter passed to the 'analyse' method, which contains SQL statements to be checked.",
  "sinks": "Potentially problematic outputs include appending 'Issue' objects to 'errors', 'warnings', or 'ignored' lists, which are used for reporting issues. No external or untrusted data sinks are directly involved.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading SQL statements from input, applying pattern-matching checks via defined 'Check' objects, and creating 'Issue' reports based on matches. No data flows into external systems or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or malicious constructs such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or unusual behaviors. All regex patterns and function logic are straightforward and related to schema analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static pattern matching on SQL statements to identify schema changes like renaming tables, dropping columns, adding constraints, and altering columns. It uses clear, well-defined functions, dataclasses, and enums. No external data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious actions are evident. The functions operate on local data, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose appears to be a static analysis tool for SQL migration scripts, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static analysis utility designed for schema change detection in SQL migration scripts. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is very low.",
