  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that imports various database analyzers and utilities related to SQL analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes and functions from local modules: base, mysql, postgresql, sqlite, and analyser.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in the provided code, as there are no data processing or output operations; primarily imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible within this snippet since it only involves import statements and no data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code consists solely of import statements with standard comments.",
