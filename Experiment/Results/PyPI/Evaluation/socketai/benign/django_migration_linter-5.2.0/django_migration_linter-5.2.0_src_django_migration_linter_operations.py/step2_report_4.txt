  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines a subclass `IgnoreMigration` of Django's `Operation`.\n   - All methods (`state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`, `describe`) are empty or return static descriptions.\n   - The class serves as a marker to signal the Django migration linter to ignore certain migrations.\n   - No external data, secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code is straightforward, well-documented, and aligns with standard Django practices for custom migration operations.\n\n2. **Assessment of Issues:**\n   - **Presence of Issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n   - **Errors or Flaws:** The logic is consistent with its purpose; no errors are apparent.\n   - **Obfuscation or Malicious Intent:** None detected.\n   - **Potential Vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations beyond signaling.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the benign nature, malware score should be 0.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Clearly not obfuscated; score should be 0.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since the code is a harmless marker, the risk score should be 0.\n\n4. **Justification for Scores:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign purpose.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks.\n   - The code is a standard pattern for controlling migration linting behavior.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:**\n   - The reports consistently rate the code as benign, with all scores at 0.\n   - No contradictions or unreasonable scores are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The analysis confirms that the code is a safe, utility class with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the code's purpose.",
