  "purpose": "A custom Django migration operation serving as a no-op marker to allow the migration linter to ignore specific migrations.",
  "sources": "The class definition and its methods, which do not process external data or perform actions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the methods are empty and serve as markers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign utility class for Django migrations, with all methods as no-ops, serving solely as a marker for the migration linter. No external data access, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose. The high confidence score (1) reflects certainty about its benign nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, well-structured utility for controlling migration linting behavior in Django. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious activity, and is free of obfuscation. The scores are correctly assigned as zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
