  "purpose": "Define a no-op migration class for Django that allows the migration linter to ignore certain migrations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definition and method declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; methods do not process untrusted data or produce side effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class methods are empty and do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's Operation intended to signal to the migration linter to ignore specific migrations. All methods are no-ops, serving only as markers or flags. No input processing, external data access, or side effects are present. The code's purpose is documentation and control within migration workflows, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign marker class used to control migration linting behavior in Django projects. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
