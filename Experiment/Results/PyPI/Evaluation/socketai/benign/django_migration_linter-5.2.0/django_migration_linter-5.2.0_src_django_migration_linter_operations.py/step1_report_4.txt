  "purpose": "Defines a no-operation custom migration class for Django, used to signal the migration linter to ignore certain migrations.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources or untrusted data reading; no dynamic input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks; the class methods do not process external data or execute harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected. The class is straightforward and serves a clear, benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's Migration Operation that acts as a no-op, primarily to enable migration linting features. All methods are empty or return static descriptions, with no dynamic code execution or external interactions. The class does not read untrusted input, execute commands, or contain suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign custom Django migration operation intended to signal the linter to ignore specific migrations. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
