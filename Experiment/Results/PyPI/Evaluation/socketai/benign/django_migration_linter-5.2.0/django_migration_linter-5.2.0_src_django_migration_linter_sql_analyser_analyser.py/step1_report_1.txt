{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to select and instantiate SQL analyser classes based on input parameters for analyzing SQL statements, likely as part of a migration or linting process.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: 'analyser_string', 'database_vendor', and 'sql_statements'. It also reads configuration values from 'ANALYSER_STRING_MAPPING'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the dynamic selection of analyser classes based on input strings and the instantiation of analyzers, which could be misused if input is malicious, but in this context, these are controlled mappings, not direct execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (analyser_string, database_vendor, sql_statements) influence the selection of the analyser class, which is then used to analyze SQL statements. The flow is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or backdoors are present. The code only performs class selection and method calls based on predefined mappings and input strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a safe mapping of strings to classes and uses input validation to prevent invalid selections. It raises errors if unknown analyzers or database vendors are provided, avoiding injection vulnerabilities. The logger is used for debugging purposes but does not pose a security risk. The overall structure is standard and does not include any obfuscated or malicious code. No external system calls, network activity, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a secure and straightforward implementation for selecting and applying SQL analysis classes based on input parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It relies on controlled mappings and validation, minimizing security risks.",
