  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds the code safe, with controlled mappings, proper validation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0, consistent with the findings.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the reviewer sees the code as standard, safe, and well-validated.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities noted.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment appears correct; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer again concludes the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** No concerns about obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting that input-driven class selection could be a vector if inputs are untrusted, but validation is in place.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, acknowledging some inherent risk in analyzing untrusted SQL code, but not from the code itself.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** The reasoning is nuanced, recognizing that the code itself is safe but that analyzing untrusted SQL statements carries inherent risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. The low security risk score reflects the potential danger of analyzing untrusted SQL, not the code's maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, noting the straightforward nature and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comment:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is well-structured, validated, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one (Report 4) assigning 0.2 due to the inherent risks of analyzing untrusted SQL statements, not because of malicious code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code's class selection logic is safe, relying on controlled mappings and input validation.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only \"risk\" stems from analyzing potentially malicious SQL code, which is outside the scope of this code's security—it's a standard utility.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the context of analyzing untrusted SQL, but not from the code itself)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is secure, well-validated, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The minor risk score reflects the inherent danger in analyzing untrusted SQL, not the code's behavior.",
