{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for selecting and using different SQL analysers based on database type or string identifiers, and performs analysis of SQL statements.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'analyser_string' parameter, 'database_vendor' string, and 'sql_statements' list.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code; the code mainly performs class selection and analysis invocation.",
  "flows": "Input strings ('analyser_string', 'database_vendor') determine which analyser class is used; 'sql_statements' are passed to the analyser for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs straightforward class selection, string handling, and logging. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and type hints, uses a mapping for database-specific analysers, and includes functions for retrieving analyser classes based on input strings or database vendors. The function 'get_sql_analyser_from_string' validates input against known keys. The 'get_sql_analyser_class_from_db_vendor' uses substring matching to select appropriate analysers. 'analyse_sql_statements' instantiates the analyser class and calls its 'analyse' method. No user input is executed or passed to unsafe functions; all operations are standard class and string handling. Logging is limited to debug messages about class selection, and no untrusted data is executed or leaks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for selecting and running SQL analysers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The design is straightforward and lacks complex or obfuscated code segments.",
