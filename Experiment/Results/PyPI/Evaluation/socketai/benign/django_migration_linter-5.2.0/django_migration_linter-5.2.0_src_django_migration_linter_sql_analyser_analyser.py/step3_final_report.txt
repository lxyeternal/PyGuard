  "purpose": "Provides functions to select and instantiate SQL analyser classes based on input strings or database vendor substrings, with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'analyser_string' and 'database_vendor' used for determining analyser class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external calls or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into validation functions, leading to class selection and instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward mapping and validation logic. Substring matching in 'get_sql_analyser_class_from_db_vendor' could be slightly manipulated if inputs are malicious, but validation mitigates this.",
  "analysis": "The code maps known strings to class types, validates inputs against a predefined dictionary, and uses substring matching for vendor detection. No dynamic code execution, no external network calls, and no obfuscation. The logger is benign. The only potential concern is the substring matching in 'get_sql_analyser_class_from_db_vendor', which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but validation against known substrings and raising exceptions on unknown inputs mitigate this risk. The code's structure and validation make it safe for its intended purpose. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The only slight risk stems from analyzing untrusted SQL statements, which is inherent to such tools but not due to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk in the context of SQL analysis.",
