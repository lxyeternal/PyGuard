  "conclusion": "The code is secure, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The only slight risk stems from analyzing untrusted SQL statements, which is inherent to such tools but not due to the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk in the context of SQL analysis."
