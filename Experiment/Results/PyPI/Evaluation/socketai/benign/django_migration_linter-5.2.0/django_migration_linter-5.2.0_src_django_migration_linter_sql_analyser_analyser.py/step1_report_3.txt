{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to select and instantiate SQL analyser classes based on the database vendor or provided string, and to analyze SQL statements using these analysers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'analyser_string', 'database_vendor', and 'sql_statements'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; it mainly instantiates classes and calls their methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('analyser_string', 'database_vendor', 'sql_statements') into functions that select analyser classes, which are then instantiated and used to analyze SQL statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The logging is benign, serving debugging purposes. No external network calls or sensitive data handling are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and logging modules, defines a mapping of string identifiers to analyser classes, and provides functions to select appropriate analyser classes based on input parameters. It raises exceptions for unknown analyser strings or database vendors, which is standard practice. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, and no insecure data handling. Logging is used only for debugging. Overall, the code performs class selection and analysis orchestration without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for selecting and using SQL analyser classes based on user input or database type. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It functions as intended for safe class selection and analysis orchestration.",
