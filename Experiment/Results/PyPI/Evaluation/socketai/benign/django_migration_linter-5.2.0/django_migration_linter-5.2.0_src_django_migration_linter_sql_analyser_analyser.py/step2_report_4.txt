  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis states that the code is safe, with controlled mappings, input validation, and no dynamic code execution. The logger is benign, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is thorough and consistent. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it highlights safe class selection, validation, and straightforward logic. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms standard class selection, validation, and no suspicious behavior. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes that while the code performs class selection based on input strings, it employs validation and exception handling, with no malicious behavior. It notes the inherent risk of analyzing untrusted SQL but considers this acceptable in context.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher, reflecting potential risk when analyzing untrusted SQL code, but this is standard in such tools.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, confirms straightforward class selection, validation, and no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs safe class selection, validation, and analysis orchestration without executing untrusted code dynamically or obfuscating logic.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious external calls.\n- **Obfuscation:** Absent.\n- **Security risk:** Minimal; the only slight concern is analyzing untrusted SQL statements, which is inherent to such tools, but the code itself does not introduce additional risks.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acknowledging the inherent risk of analyzing untrusted SQL, but this is standard and not a flaw in the code itself.\n\n**Summary:** The code is secure, well-structured, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The slight security risk score reflects the context of analyzing potentially untrusted SQL, not a flaw in the implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and justified. No adjustments needed.",
