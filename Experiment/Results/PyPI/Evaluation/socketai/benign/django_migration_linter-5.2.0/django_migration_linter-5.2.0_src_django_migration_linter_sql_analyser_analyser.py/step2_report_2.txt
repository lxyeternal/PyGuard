  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code provides functions to select SQL analyzer classes based on input strings or database vendor substrings.\n- It performs input validation against predefined mappings.\n- It instantiates analyzers and runs analysis on provided SQL statements.\n- The code uses logging for debugging but does not execute untrusted code or perform external system calls.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Assessment:**\n- Correctly identifies that the code is safe, with controlled mappings and validation.\n- No anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score: 0** — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — accurate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — justified, as the code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms the code's safety.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score: 0** — justified.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — justified.\n- **Risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Assessment:**\n- Same conclusions: safe, straightforward utility functions.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scoring is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly more cautious note about the dynamic class selection based on input strings.\n- Recognizes that input validation is performed against known keys.\n- Notes that analyzing untrusted SQL statements could pose inherent risks, but this is expected in such tools.\n- **Malware score: 0** — aligns with the code.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — correct.\n- **Security risk: 0.2** — slightly higher due to the potential for analyzing untrusted SQL code, but not a direct vulnerability.\n\n**Potential Issue:**\n- The report assigns a small security risk (0.2) due to analyzing untrusted SQL statements, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is justified. The code itself is safe; the risk comes from analyzing untrusted input, which is inherent to such tools.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Assessment:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizes the straightforward nature of class selection.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Risk score: 0** — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code does not execute untrusted code, perform network calls, or contain obfuscated segments.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, which is appropriate. Report 4 assigns 0.2, reflecting the potential risks inherent in analyzing untrusted SQL statements, which is reasonable.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code's class selection based on input strings is controlled and validated, reducing injection risk.\n- The only potential concern is the analysis of untrusted SQL, but this is a known and accepted risk in SQL analysis tools, not a flaw in the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — inherent risk in analyzing untrusted SQL, but the code itself is safe.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review above.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is secure, well-structured, and does not contain obfuscation or malware. The slight risk score reflects the context of analyzing untrusted SQL code, which is acceptable in such tools.",
