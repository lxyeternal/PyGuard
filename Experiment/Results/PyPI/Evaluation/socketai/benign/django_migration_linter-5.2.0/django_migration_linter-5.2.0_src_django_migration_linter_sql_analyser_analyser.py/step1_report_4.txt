{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for selecting and using SQL analyzers based on database vendor or input strings, primarily for static analysis of SQL statements in a migration linting context.",
  "sources": "User-provided input for database vendor strings and optional analyser strings; potentially, the 'sql_statements' parameter in 'analyse_sql_statements'.",
  "sinks": "The 'sql_statements' list passed to 'analyse_sql_statements', which could contain untrusted SQL code; the dynamic class selection based on input strings, which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input strings ('analyser_string', 'database_vendor') influence selection of analyzer classes; 'sql_statements' are analyzed by the selected analyzer, which may process untrusted SQL code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of dynamic class selection based on input strings is standard but should be verified with input validation, which is partially done via known keys and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation on the 'analyser_string' against a predefined mapping. The 'get_sql_analyser_class_from_db_vendor' function matches substrings within 'database_vendor' to select analyzers, raising exceptions for unsupported vendors. The 'analyse_sql_statements' function instantiates an analyzer and processes a list of SQL statements. The overall structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No data leakage, hidden network activity, or malicious code segments are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for selecting SQL analyzers and analyzing SQL statements with proper input validation and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The use of input-driven class selection is typical in such contexts, and no security risks are evident beyond the inherent risks of analyzing untrusted SQL code, which is expected in such tools.",
