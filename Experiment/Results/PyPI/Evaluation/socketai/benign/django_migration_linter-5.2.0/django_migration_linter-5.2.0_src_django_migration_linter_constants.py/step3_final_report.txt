  "purpose": "The code sets up configuration constants for a Django migration linter, including cache directory path and app/migration argument lists.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and appdirs, definition of __version__, and constants DEFAULT_CACHE_PATH, DJANGO_APPS_WITH_MIGRATIONS, EXPECTED_DATA_MIGRATION_ARGS.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version string and constants; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration setup importing standard modules, defining version and constants, and setting a cache directory path. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports accurately assess its safety, and no changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
