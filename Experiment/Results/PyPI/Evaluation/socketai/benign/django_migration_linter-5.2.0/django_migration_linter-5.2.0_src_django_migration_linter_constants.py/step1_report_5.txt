  "purpose": "Set up constants and configuration for a Django migration linter, including versioning and cache directory location.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__, appdirs.user_cache_dir, module variables (__version__).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows to sensitive operations or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for compatibility, retrieves a user cache directory specific to the application 'django-migration-linter' with a version tag, and sets up constant tuples for Django apps and migration arguments. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications or suspicious logic. The code serves standard configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration snippet setting up cache directories and constants for a Django migration linter. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
