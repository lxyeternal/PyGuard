  "purpose": "Define constants and configurations related to cache directory and Django migration applications",
  "sources": "user_cache_dir function call that retrieves a user-specific cache directory",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no output or data leakage points",
  "flows": "Input from user_cache_dir flows into DEFAULT_CACHE_PATH",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior; standard use of a library function",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function from appdirs to determine a cache directory path, using a version string for versioning. It also defines some tuple constants for Django apps and migration args. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The code appears to perform straightforward configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard configuration code for setting cache paths and application constants. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
