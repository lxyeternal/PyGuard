  "purpose": "Define constants and import functions for managing cache paths and Django app configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'user_cache_dir' from 'appdirs'; reference to '__version__' and usage of 'user_cache_dir' with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file write, or other potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily defines constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward use of a standard library function with a static string and version.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for determining user cache directory paths, defines a version string, and sets a default cache path using a standard library function. It also defines tuples related to Django applications and migration arguments. All operations are static and do not involve any user input, network activity, or dynamic execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focused on configuration and constants. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
