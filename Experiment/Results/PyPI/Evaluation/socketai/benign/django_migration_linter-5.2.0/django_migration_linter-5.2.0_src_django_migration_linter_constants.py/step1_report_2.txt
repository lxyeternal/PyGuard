  "purpose": "Define constants and import functions for managing cache directory paths and migration app configurations.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__, import user_cache_dir from appdirs, define __version__, define DEFAULT_CACHE_PATH using user_cache_dir, define tuples for migration apps and args.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; no network or data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from __future__, imports a standard library function for user cache directory, and sets constants for versioning and directory paths. It uses standard library and third-party modules as intended. The code's purpose appears to be configuration, with no evidence of malicious behavior. It does not perform any network communication, data manipulation, or system modifications beyond setting constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign configuration/setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
