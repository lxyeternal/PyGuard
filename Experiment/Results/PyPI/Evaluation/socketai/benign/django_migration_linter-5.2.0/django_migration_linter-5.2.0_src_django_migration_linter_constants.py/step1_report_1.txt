{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration constants and cache directory path for a Django migration linter tool.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__, import from appdirs, and module-level variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; code primarily sets constants and paths.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. Usage of standard libraries and functions is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, uses 'appdirs' to determine user cache directory, and sets constants for versioning and Django app migration expectations. The 'user_cache_dir' usage is standard and benign. No external input or untrusted data processing is present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward configuration setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be a normal part of a Python project for managing cache paths and constants related to Django migrations.",
