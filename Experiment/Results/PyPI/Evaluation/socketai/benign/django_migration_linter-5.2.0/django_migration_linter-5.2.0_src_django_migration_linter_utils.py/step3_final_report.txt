  "purpose": "Utility functions for path splitting, migration path parsing, byte decoding, and dynamic import of Django migration modules.",
  "sources": "Parameters like migration_path, app_label, migration_name, and module attributes such as __file__.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via import_module, access to __file__ attribute of imported modules.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (migration_path, app_label, migration_name) used in path functions and to construct module import strings, leading to import_module and __file__ access.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_module with external parameters without explicit validation; reliance on potentially untrusted input for dynamic imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard filesystem and Django migration utility functions. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is present. The primary security concern is the dynamic import based on parameters that could be manipulated if not validated, which could lead to module injection. The functions are straightforward and align with typical Django patterns. The malware score is justified as zero, obfuscation is absent, and the low risk score (~0.2) accounts for potential exploitation if inputs are untrusted. Proper input validation would mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard for Django migration handling, with no evidence of malicious intent. The main security consideration is input validation for dynamic imports to prevent module injection. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
