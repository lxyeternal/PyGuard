  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe utility functions that handle path splitting, migration path parsing, byte decoding, and dynamic import of Django migration modules.\n- The functions rely on parameters derived from Django settings or filesystem data, with dynamic import via import_module.\n- No reports mention any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, network activity, or suspicious data handling.\n- The primary concern noted is the use of dynamic import_module with potentially untrusted input parameters, which could lead to module injection if inputs are maliciously crafted or not validated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code's logic appears correct for its intended purpose.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The use of `import_module` with external parameters could be risky if inputs are not sanitized, but in typical Django use, these are controlled.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The main flaw is the potential for **module injection** if `app_label` or `migration_name` are derived from untrusted sources without validation.\n- No input validation is explicitly performed before dynamic import, which could be a concern in insecure environments.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to dynamic import potential.\n\n**Suggestion:** The security risk score could be slightly increased to 0.3 if considering the potential for module injection with unvalidated inputs, but given the context, 0.2–0.3 seems reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n- The main concern is the dynamic import based on parameters, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious.\n- Since the reports already assign low scores, raising them above 0.5 would be unjustified unless there's explicit evidence of exploitation.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: functions are standard, with minimal security concerns.\n- The potential for exploitation is acknowledged but considered low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (low, due to dynamic import potential)\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (acceptable, but warrants caution if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is standard Django utility functions with no malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the use of dynamic import with external parameters, which should be validated in production environments. The current scores are appropriate, and no significant adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always validate and sanitize parameters used in dynamic imports to prevent module injection vulnerabilities.",
