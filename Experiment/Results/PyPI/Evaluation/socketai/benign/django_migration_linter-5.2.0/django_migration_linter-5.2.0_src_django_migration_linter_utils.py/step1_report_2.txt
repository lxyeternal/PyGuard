  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling file paths, migration paths, and loading Django migration modules.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'path', 'migration_path', 'byte_input', 'app_label', and 'migration_name'.",
  "sinks": "import_module function which loads modules based on constructed paths and uses migration_module.__file__ to access file paths.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through string and path manipulations, then used to dynamically import modules and access their __file__ attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of modules using potentially constructed strings. The code modifies and accesses module __file__ attributes without sanitization. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code snippets. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for path splitting, migration path parsing, byte decoding, and dynamic module import. It relies on standard Django migration loader mechanisms. The dynamic import is based on parameters, but no user input is directly used in a way that introduces injection risk. The module's __file__ attribute is accessed to determine the file path, which is a standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The only potential concern is the dynamic import, but it appears to be intended for legitimate use within Django migrations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily utility functions for Django migrations with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The dynamic module import is standard but relies on correct parameters. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall security risk is minimal.",
