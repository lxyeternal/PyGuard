  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling file paths, migration paths, and importing Django migration modules.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'path', 'migration_path', 'app_label', 'migration_name'. Dynamic import of migration modules using import_module.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules with import_module, access to __file__ attribute of imported modules.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> split_path / split_migration_path / get_migration_abspath; import_module -> access __file__ attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_module for dynamic import could potentially be exploited if malicious inputs are provided, but inputs are typically controlled within application context. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual behavior, no code injection evident.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily perform path manipulations and import operations based on provided strings. 'split_path' decomposes filesystem paths. 'split_migration_path' locates migration modules within a path, relying on Django's migration module name. 'clean_bytes_to_str' decodes bytes. 'get_migration_abspath' dynamically imports migration modules and accesses their __file__ attribute. The use of import_module with external input could pose risks if inputs are not sanitized, but in typical use, inputs are derived from controlled Django settings or filesystem data. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code does not contain suspicious network activity, credential harvesting, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve legitimate purposes within Django migration handling. It employs dynamic importing, which, if misused with untrusted input, could pose security risks, but in the current context, it seems controlled. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. Overall, the security risk is low.",
