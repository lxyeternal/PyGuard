  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no network activity; no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs filesystem path manipulation, dynamic importing of Django migration modules, and extraction of migration file paths. It uses standard libraries and Django ORM components. No user input or untrusted data sources are directly used in a way that could lead to code injection. The import_module call depends on constructed strings but appears intended for legitimate module retrieval. No hidden or malicious behaviors are evident. The handling of __file__ attribute is standard for imported modules. No anomalies or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for managing Django migrations and filesystem paths. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The use of dynamic import is appropriate for its purpose and does not pose a security threat in this context.",
