{
  "purpose": "Static analysis and validation of Django migration files, including SQL statements and Python code inspection, to identify issues and ensure best practices.",
  "sources": "Migration files read from disk, source code inspected via 'inspect', subprocess calls to 'sqlmigrate' and 'git diff' to generate SQL and identify relevant migration files.",
  "sinks": "External commands ('call_command', 'Popen') for SQL generation, source code inspection for patterns, logging issues; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Source files → hashing and reading; source code → regex and inspect analysis; subprocess calls → SQL extraction; git diff → migration file identification.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of regex and subprocess is standard for static analysis tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of Django migrations, hashing files for caching, executing 'sqlmigrate' via subprocess, inspecting source code with 'inspect', and analyzing SQL statements. It checks for migration issues, model import correctness, naming conventions, reversibility, and potential security concerns. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are controlled and typical for such tools. The regex and source inspection are straightforward. Overall, the code is a well-structured, standard Django migration linter with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static analysis tool for Django migrations, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the use of subprocesses and file I/O within a controlled environment.",
