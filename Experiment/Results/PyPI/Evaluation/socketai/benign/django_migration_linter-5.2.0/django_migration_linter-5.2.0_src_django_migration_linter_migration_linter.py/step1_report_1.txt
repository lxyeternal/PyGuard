{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to analyze and lint Django migration files for potential issues, errors, warnings, and security concerns, primarily focusing on SQL statements and RunPython operations within migrations.",
  "sources": "The code reads migration files from specified paths, accesses database connection info, executes 'sqlmigrate' commands, inspects source code of migration functions, and reads migration lists from files or git diffs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security impacts could occur if untrusted input influenced SQL execution or code inspection, but in this code, data sources are mainly internal files, command outputs, or code source inspection; no direct untrusted user input is processed.",
  "flows": "Migration files are read and hashed; migration content is analyzed; SQL statements are extracted and passed to analyzers; migration functions are inspected for model import issues; results are cached and printed. Data flows from files/commands to internal analysis and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code injections or backdoors. The code performs standard file I/O, process invocation, and code inspection. It utilizes regex and source code analysis for migration validation; no obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically inspects migration files, hashes content for caching, executes 'sqlmigrate' commands, inspects source code of migration functions for model import issues, and logs issues. All operations are standard for migration linting. No external inputs influence SQL or code execution beyond standard Django mechanisms. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or suspicious network activity are present. The focus is on static analysis, not runtime or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, comprehensive Django migration linter with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It primarily reads files, inspects code, and logs issues without executing untrusted code or connecting to external servers. The overall security risk is very low.",
