  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard static analysis of Django migrations, reading files, executing 'sqlmigrate', inspecting code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; flows are for analysis and logging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Uses standard techniques (regex, inspect, subprocess). No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears to be a typical, well-structured Django migration linter with no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1)\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. No issues found. The code is standard static analysis code, no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis, including subprocess calls to 'sqlmigrate', code inspection, git diff.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External commands are standard; no malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code. Use of 'inspect.getsource' and regex is typical for static analysis. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, low risk, no signs of sabotage.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher but still low (0.2)\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No malware or obfuscation detected. Standard static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static analysis, subprocess calls, code inspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same as above, no malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Use of subprocess is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2)\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code is standard for a migration linter.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar analysis, external commands, code inspection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate static analysis tool.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2)\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard static analysis, subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious or suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate static analysis code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.2)\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports agree that the code is a static analysis tool for Django migrations.\n- **Malware indicators:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low, consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only concern could be subprocess calls, but these are standard for such tools and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to external command calls, but justified as standard for such tools)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured Django migration linter performing static analysis. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage is evident. The risk and malware scores are appropriate and should remain at 0, with a slight increase in the overall risk score to 0.2 due to external command execution, which is typical for such tools but not inherently dangerous.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
