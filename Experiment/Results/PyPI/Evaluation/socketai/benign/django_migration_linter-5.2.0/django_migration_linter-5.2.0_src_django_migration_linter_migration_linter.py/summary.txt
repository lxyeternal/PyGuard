  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static analysis tool for Django migrations, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the use of subprocesses and file I/O within a controlled environment."
