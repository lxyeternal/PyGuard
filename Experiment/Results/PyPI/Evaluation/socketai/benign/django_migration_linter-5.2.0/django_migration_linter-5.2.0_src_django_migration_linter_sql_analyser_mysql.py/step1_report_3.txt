{
  "purpose": "Define a MySQL analyser class with specific regex-based checks for SQL migration scripts.",
  "sources": "The regex functions analyzing SQL strings, particularly the 'fn' lambda in 'migration_checks' and the 'detect_column' static method.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "The 'fn' lambda processes SQL strings to detect specific patterns; 'detect_column' extracts column names from SQL statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward and intended for pattern detection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'MySqlAnalyser' inheriting from 'BaseAnalyser'. It contains a list of checks using regex to identify ALTER TABLE modifications and a static method to detect column names in SQL statements. The regex patterns look for specific SQL syntax constructs. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. No external or untrusted data sources, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The checks and methods are focused solely on pattern matching for SQL analysis, which is typical for static analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static analysis utility for SQL migration scripts. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The implementation is simple, and the code appears safe and purposeful for its intended function.",
