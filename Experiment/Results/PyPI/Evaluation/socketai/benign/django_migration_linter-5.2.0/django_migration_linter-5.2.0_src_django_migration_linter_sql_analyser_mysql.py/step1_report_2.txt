  "purpose": "This code defines a class MySqlAnalyser that performs analysis on SQL migration scripts, specifically checking for ALTER TABLE modifications and detecting column names.",
  "sources": "Input SQL strings provided to the check functions and the detect_column method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the regexes are used with untrusted input directly in SQL execution, but here they are only pattern matching. No direct sinks like database execution or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings are analyzed by regex within lambda functions and the detect_column method, with no external data flow to other components.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated elements, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. It is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines a class MySqlAnalyser with a list of checks for SQL modifications, and includes a static method to extract column names using regex. The regex patterns are standard and only perform pattern matching on input strings. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration. The checks are intended for identifying schema changes in SQL migration scripts, which is a typical analysis task. The design is simple, with no anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard analysis utility for SQL migration scripts. It performs pattern matching to identify ALTER COLUMN statements and extract column names. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
