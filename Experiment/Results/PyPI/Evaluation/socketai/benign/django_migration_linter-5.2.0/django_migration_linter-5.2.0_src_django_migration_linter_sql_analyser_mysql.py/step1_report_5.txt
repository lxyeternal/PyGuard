  "purpose": "This code defines a MySQL analyser class for checking SQL migration statements for specific patterns, mainly focusing on ALTER TABLE modifications.",
  "sources": "User-provided SQL strings passed to lambda functions and the detect_column method.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted data is directly written or executed. The regex operations analyze input strings for patterns.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings are passed to lambda functions and detect_column method; regex searches analyze these strings for patterns such as ALTER and COLUMN/MODIFY clauses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse SQL strings; no evident malicious code or hardcoded secrets. No suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The class MySqlAnalyser provides mechanisms to identify specific SQL patterns using regex. It includes a check for ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY ... NULL statements and a method to detect column names from SQL statements. All regex operations are straightforward pattern matches on input strings. No external data sources, sinks, or untrusted data flows indicate malicious intent. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of analyzing SQL migration scripts without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs pattern matching on SQL statements for analysis purposes and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a benign utility for SQL migration checks with no security risks identified.",
