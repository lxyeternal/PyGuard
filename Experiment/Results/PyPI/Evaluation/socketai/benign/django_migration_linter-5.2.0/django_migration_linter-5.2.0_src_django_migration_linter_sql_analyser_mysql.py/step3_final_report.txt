  "purpose": "Static analysis of SQL migration scripts to identify schema modification patterns, specifically ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY ... statements, and extract column names.",
  "sources": "Input SQL strings provided to regex checks and the detect_column method parsing SQL statements.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs regex pattern matching without executing or manipulating data.",
  "flows": "Input SQL strings are matched against regex patterns to detect specific schema changes and extract column names.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; regex patterns are straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for static analysis of SQL migration scripts, using regex to identify ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY ... patterns and extract column names. It does not execute SQL or perform external operations. The regex patterns are simple and appropriate for their purpose. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. Malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are very low (~0.1), justified by the lack of external sinks or malicious behavior. The confidence in these assessments is high (~0.9-1). The code's purpose is analysis, not execution, and it handles input strings safely. No evidence suggests malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for SQL migration scripts, performing pattern matching without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
