  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and defines the package version, providing metadata for the open-source project.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments and assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not execute any logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a version string assignment with no dynamic or executable logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code is standard metadata, posing no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header and version declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
