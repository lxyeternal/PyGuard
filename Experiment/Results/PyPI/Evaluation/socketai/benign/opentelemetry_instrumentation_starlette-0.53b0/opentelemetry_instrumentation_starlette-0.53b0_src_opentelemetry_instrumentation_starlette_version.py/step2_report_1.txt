  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It contains only license comments and a static version string assignment.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Correctly identifies that the code is metadata-only, with no malicious intent.  \n   - Scores: malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 — appropriate.  \n   - No issues here.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Also correctly states that this is just header information with no suspicious activity.  \n   - Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Same conclusion: straightforward version and license info, no malicious activity.  \n   - Scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Recognizes that the code is only license comments and a version string.  \n   - No anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n   - Scores are consistent.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same as above; standard metadata code.  \n   - Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as described—just license comments and a version string.  \n- **Malware potential:** None. The malware score should be 0, which it is.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.  \n- **Security risk:** No risk from this code snippet; scores are 0.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is benign.\n- The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- I agree with all the current scores.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is purely metadata with no security concerns.",
