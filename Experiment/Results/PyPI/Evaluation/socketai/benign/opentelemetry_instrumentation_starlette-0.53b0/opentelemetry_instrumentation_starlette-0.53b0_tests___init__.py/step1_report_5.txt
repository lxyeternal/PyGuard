  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple utility for processing or transforming data, with no explicit malicious intent evident from the visible code.",
  "sources": "Data is read from standard input, files, or function parameters (not explicitly shown in the code snippet).",
  "sinks": "Data is output to the console, files, or network endpoints (not explicitly shown in the code snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly culminating in output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and does not contain complex or suspicious constructs. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present. The code structure and content do not indicate obfuscation or hidden functionality. No unusual use of environment variables or insecure practices are evident. The overall design suggests benign behavior, likely intended for data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation with no malicious intent or supply chain vulnerabilities.",
