  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, user input, network sockets, and dynamic code execution functions like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration via network, system commands, file operations, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network inputs flow into sinks like system commands or network transmissions, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, encrypted-looking strings, dynamic code execution, and suspicious patterns of data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Suspicious patterns include eval/exec usage, encrypted data, and obfuscated variables, indicating potential malware. Benign reports lack such patterns and show straightforward data processing. The scores assigned reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores justified for suspicious code. The overall risk score aligns with the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution in Report 3.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains a component with high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting caution. Other reports appear benign. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with Report 3 indicating a significant security concern.",
