  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a tuple `_instruments` with version constraints for a package (`starlette >= 0.13, <0.15`)\n- Defines a boolean `_supports_metrics` set to `True`\n- Contains only licensing comments and variable assignments\n- No executable logic, data flow, user input, or network activity\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports correctly identify that the code is benign configuration code with no malicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and free of suspicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Risk Score Analysis:\n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Since there's no executable logic, no data flow, no external input, and no suspicious patterns, elevating the risk score isn't justified.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports emphasize that the code is just configuration, with no malicious intent.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is based solely on the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign configuration data with no security issues. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the existing scores reflect its benign nature accurately.",
