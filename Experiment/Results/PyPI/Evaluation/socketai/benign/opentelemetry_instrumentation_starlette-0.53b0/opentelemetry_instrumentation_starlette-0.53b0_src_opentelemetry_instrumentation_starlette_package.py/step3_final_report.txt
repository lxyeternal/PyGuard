  "purpose": "Define dependency constraints for the 'starlette' package and indicate support for metrics.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignment of '_instruments' with version constraints.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not process untrusted input or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no dynamic or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward configuration with licensing comments only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable definitions and licensing comments, with no executable logic, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. The dependency version constraints are standard, and the boolean flag is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for dependency declaration in open-source projects, with no suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration data with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
