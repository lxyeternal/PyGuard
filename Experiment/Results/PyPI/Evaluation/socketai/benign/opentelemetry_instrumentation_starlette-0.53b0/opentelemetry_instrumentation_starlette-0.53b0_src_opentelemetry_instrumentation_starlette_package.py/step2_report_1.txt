  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a set of variable assignments defining:\n  - `_instruments`: a tuple specifying a package dependency with version constraints (`\"starlette >= 0.13, <0.15\"`).\n  - `_supports_metrics`: a boolean flag (`True`).\n- The code contains only licensing comments and static variable definitions.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not exhibit any issues such as malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are apparent in the code or the reports.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n  - Confidence is 1, indicating certainty in benign nature.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, configuration-like, with no malicious intent.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no assumptions that could be challenged.\n- The version constraints in `_instruments` are standard and not suspicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware, as confirmed by the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious behavior detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score (0):** No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is purely configuration, with no security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate in their benign assessment.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard dependency declaration, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The existing reports and scores are justified and accurate.",
