  "sources": "Constants _instruments and _supports_metrics",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow to untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or user input involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard configuration code with licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains licensing comments and two variables: _instruments (a tuple with version specifications) and _supports_metrics (a boolean). No user input, external data sources, or sensitive information are involved. The code appears to set configuration parameters for an OpenTelemetry module. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present. The content is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of licensing comments and configuration variables without any malicious intent or security issues.",
