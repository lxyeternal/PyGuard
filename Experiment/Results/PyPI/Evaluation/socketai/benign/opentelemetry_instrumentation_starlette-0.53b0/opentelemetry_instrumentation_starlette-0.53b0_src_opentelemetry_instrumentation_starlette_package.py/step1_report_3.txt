  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; only constant definitions and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, a tuple with version constraints, and a boolean flag. There are no suspicious behaviors, data processing, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a standard module header or configuration snippet for a Python package. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
