  "purpose": "Defines a tuple of instrument package requirements and a boolean flag indicating support for metrics, likely used for configuration or dependency management.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; the code only declares static variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential security impact.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments: a tuple specifying version constraints for a package and a boolean flag. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or other potentially malicious constructs. The license headers are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be configuration for dependencies and features, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet specifying dependency versions and a feature flag. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for open-source projects.",
