  "purpose": "Define a tuple of instrument package dependencies and a support flag for metrics.",
  "sources": "The tuple '_instruments' and the boolean '_supports_metrics'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data usage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of variable assignments defining package dependencies and a support flag. It includes licensing comments but no executable logic, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution. The variables '_instruments' and '_supports_metrics' are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be part of a configuration or dependency declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration for package dependencies. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
