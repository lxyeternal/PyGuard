  "purpose": "Setup script for the dm_control Python package, managing build, install, and test commands, as well as dependencies and data files.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., PYTHONPATH), file system (checking header files, finding data files), subprocess (running autowrap.py), and package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess call to run autowrap.py with header paths; potential modification of environment variables (PYTHONPATH).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are modified before subprocess execution; header files are read to generate bindings; data files are discovered for package data inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of subprocess to run a script (`autowrap.py`) is standard for code generation, but it could be misused if autowrap.py is malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. The script modifies environment variables temporarily for subprocess execution, which is typical but should be noted.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package setup procedures: collecting header files, configuring build options, running a code generator (autowrap.py), and setting up package data. It uses standard Python modules and setuptools for installation workflows. The subprocess call executes an external script (`autowrap.py`), which could be a risk if that script is malicious, but based on this code alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious behavior detected. The code's structure and content are typical for a setup script, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for building and installing a Python package related to MuJoCo physics. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The only notable aspect is the execution of an external script (`autowrap.py`) during the build process, which is expected in such contexts but warrants trust in the autowrap script itself. Overall, the script is safe and primarily performs configuration and build orchestration.",
