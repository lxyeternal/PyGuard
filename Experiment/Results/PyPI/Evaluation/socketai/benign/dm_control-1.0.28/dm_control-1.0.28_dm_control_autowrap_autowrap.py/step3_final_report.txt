  "purpose": "A utility script that reads MuJoCo header files, parses enums, constants, and hints, and generates Python binding source files for MuJoCo integration.",
  "sources": "Reads header files specified via command-line flags, particularly 'mjmodel.h' and 'mjxmacro.h', and parses their content.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python source files ('constants.py', 'enums.py', 'sizes.py') to the specified output directory.",
  "flows": "Reads header files -> Parses enums/constants/hints -> Generates Python source files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious activity, no obfuscated code, no network activity, no data leaks, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O to read header files, uses external modules for parsing and code generation, and writes output files. It does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input beyond file paths, or perform dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose is solely to generate Python bindings for MuJoCo, a well-defined and purpose-specific task.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, transparent utility for generating MuJoCo Python bindings. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The code is straightforward, with no network activity or suspicious patterns. The risk and malware scores are justified as zero, and the obfuscation score is zero. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
