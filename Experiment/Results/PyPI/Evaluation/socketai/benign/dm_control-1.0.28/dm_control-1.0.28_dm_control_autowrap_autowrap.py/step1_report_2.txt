{
  "purpose": "The script automatically generates ctypes Python bindings for MuJoCo by parsing specific header files and creating corresponding Python source files.",
  "sources": "Reads MuJoCo header files specified by the user via command-line flags; reads configuration flags for input header paths and output directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated Python files (constants.py, enums.py, sizes.py) to the specified output directory.",
  "flows": "Reads header files during parsing and then writes generated source files to the output directory as specified by user flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or obfuscated code, no hidden network activity, and no dynamic execution or evaluation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard code generator script that processes C header files to generate Python binding code. It uses external libraries for parsing and code generation, handles input files via command-line flags, and writes output files to a user-specified directory. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden network activity. The code functions solely as a utility for binding generation, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate and purpose-driven code generator for MuJoCo Python bindings. It performs standard file I/O and parsing operations with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
