{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions and configuration for managing and loading manipulation environments, including tag filtering, timeout settings, and environment instantiation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from flags (FLAGS), environment names, and tags provided as function arguments, as well as from the registry via get_all_names, get_tags, and get_constructor methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code mainly retrieves data from the registry and creates environment objects.",
  "flows": "Input flags influence timeout settings (_get_timeout), which in turn affect environment loading (load function). Environment names and tags are retrieved from the registry to generate environment instances.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on external registry calls, which are standard; no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes configuration flags and retrieves environment data from a registry. It manages a global timeout variable, with conditional defaulting based on flag parsing. The load function creates environment objects with specified parameters. All operations appear standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. External dependencies and registry methods are assumed to be legitimate. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration and environment management utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is a typical implementation for managing simulation environments with standard practices.",
