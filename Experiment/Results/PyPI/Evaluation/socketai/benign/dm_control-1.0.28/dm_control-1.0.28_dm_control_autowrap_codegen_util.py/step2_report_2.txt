  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n1. **First report:**\n   - **Summary:** The code is utility functions for string indentation, macro name handling, dictionary lookup, and comment formatting. No untrusted data, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n   - **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward utility functions with no security issues. The functions operate on static or provided data, with no external dependencies or data flows. The conclusion that the code is safe and benign is accurate.\n   - **Score justification:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n2. **Second report:**\n   - **Summary:** Similar to the first, emphasizing the lack of external input, data sinks, or malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent.\n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n3. **Third report:**\n   - **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, no external data handling, no suspicious behavior, straightforward utility functions.\n   - **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n4. **Fourth report:**\n   - **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing no external input, no data exfiltration, no suspicious patterns.\n   - **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a benign set of helpers.\n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n5. **Fifth report:**\n   - **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is straightforward, with no external data flows or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Assessment:** Accurate. The functions are utility helpers with no malicious features.\n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is purely utility functions with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's actual content. No changes are necessary.",
