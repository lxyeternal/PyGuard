{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions for string indentation, dictionary management, macro name handling, type coercion, and comment formatting, primarily used by autowrap.py.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, constant variables, and input parameters to functions (such as strings to be indented or wrapped).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted or external data sources; functions perform local transformations only.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve static string manipulation, dictionary key lookups, and simple data processing with no external data or untrusted input flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and classes with straightforward, transparent logic. The Indenter class manages indentation levels, and other functions perform string and dictionary manipulations. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. The use of static constants and simple flow control indicates safe and intended behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of helper utilities with no malicious or suspicious features. It appears to be safe and standard, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
