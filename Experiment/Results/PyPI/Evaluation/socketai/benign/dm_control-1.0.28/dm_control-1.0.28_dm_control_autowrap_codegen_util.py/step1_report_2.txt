  "purpose": "Provide miscellaneous helper functions for code formatting, data handling, and macro name processing.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present; functions operate on inputs and return processed data.",
  "flows": "The code consists of utility functions with no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic, is present. The code appears to be standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The script contains helper classes and functions for string indentation, macro name processing, recursive dictionary lookups, and comment line formatting. These are straightforward utilities with no external data input or malicious behavior. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or other security risks. The code uses safe Python features and libraries, and does not contain obfuscation, malware, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard utility code without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project and does not include any suspicious or malicious features.",
