  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the code's security implications step-by-step.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists of utility functions and classes for string indentation, macro name handling, dictionary management, and comment formatting.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or untrusted input handling are present.\n- The functions are straightforward, with clear purposes, and do not perform any malicious actions.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports concur on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code matches the description; no issues or anomalies are evident.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None detected; the code is utility-focused.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; no external inputs, no data leaks, no code injection.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No flawed reasoning or overlooked security concerns are identified.\n- The functions are safe, well-structured, and typical for utility modules.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:** No adjustments needed; scores are consistent with the code's content.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities assumptions:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is purely utility functions.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, non-malicious, and contains no security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module with no security concerns.",
