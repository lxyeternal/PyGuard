{
  "purpose": "Provide miscellaneous helper functions for string indentation, macro name handling, dictionary lookup, and comment formatting used in autowrap.py.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules: collections; constants like _MJXMACRO_SUFFIX; functions and class methods within the script.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; functions operate on provided parameters or static data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; functions process inputs but do not handle untrusted external data or perform network/database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with clear purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions: Indenter manages string indentation contexts, with proper __enter__ and __exit__ methods; indent function adds indentation to multiline strings; UniqueOrderedDict enforces key uniqueness; macro_struct_name and is_macro_pointer handle macro naming conventions; try_coerce_to_num converts strings to numeric types; recursive_dict_lookup performs recursive key replacement in dictionaries; comment_line creates formatted comment lines. All functions operate on static or provided data without external dependencies or external data flows. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with no suspicious, malicious, or insecure behaviors. It appears to be safe and intended solely for code generation or string manipulation tasks related to macro handling and formatting.",
