  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions and classes for string indentation, macro name handling, dictionary operations, and comment formatting, primarily used in code generation or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading operations are present.",
  "targets": "No data is being written or sent to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions operate on provided arguments without external input dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected. Functions perform straightforward utility operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for string formatting, dictionary management, and macro name processing. There are no data input/output, network operations, or system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are present. The functions are self-contained and perform typical utility tasks with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module used for formatting and data handling within larger codebases. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
