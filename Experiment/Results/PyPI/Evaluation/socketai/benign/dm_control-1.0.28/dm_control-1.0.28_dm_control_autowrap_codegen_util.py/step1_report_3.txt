  "purpose": "Provide miscellaneous helper functions for code formatting, data structures, and string manipulation, used by autowrap.py.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read; internal constants and parameters are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive information processing present.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions are utility helpers with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and well-structured without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper classes and functions such as Indenter, UniqueOrderedDict, macro name conversions, and string manipulations. It includes context management, string formatting, dictionary management, and type coercion. There are no network operations, no sensitive data handling, and no dynamic code execution or external inputs. All functions serve common utility purposes without any malicious intent or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of utility functions intended for code formatting and data structure management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is clean, well-documented, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
