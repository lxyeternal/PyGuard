{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for string indentation, macro name handling, dictionary operations, and comment formatting within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Static data within functions and class methods; no external input, network, or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate on provided or static data without external data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions process static or input parameters locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and classes for string manipulation, macro name processing, dictionary management, and comment formatting. It does not handle external data, perform network operations, or execute any malicious actions. The functions are simple, clear, and serve well-defined purposes. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The static analysis indicates a benign intent, with no vulnerabilities or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the assigned scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
