  "purpose": "Define parsing rules and helper functions for MuJoCo header files using pyparsing.",
  "sources": "Imports (pyparsing library), static string patterns, and preprocessor directive definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no execution of untrusted input or data manipulation leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code only constructs parsing grammars; it does not process external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of static parsing rule definitions for MuJoCo headers, involving string patterns, nested scope constructs, and preprocessor directives. It uses pyparsing to build recursive parsers for nested structures and comments. No code executes external commands, manages network connections, or handles untrusted input at runtime. All code appears to be for static parsing support. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious logic. It is purely defining parsing grammars.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing C header files related to MuJoCo, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe and not suspicious.",
