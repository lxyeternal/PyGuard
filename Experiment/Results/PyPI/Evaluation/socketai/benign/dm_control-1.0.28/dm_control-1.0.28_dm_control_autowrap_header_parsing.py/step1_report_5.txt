{
  "purpose": "Defines parsing rules and helper functions for processing MuJoCo header files using pyparsing.",
  "sources": "Imports pyparsing library, defines constants, dictionaries, and functions for parsing headers and code structures.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external output; no functions that process input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Parsing rules define flow of token recognition but do not execute or process untrusted data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. Code uses standard parsing patterns, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains definitions for parsing C-like headers, including macros, types, structs, enums, and function signatures. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected. The use of pyparsing appears purely for static parsing purposes. No malicious intent or malicious code behaviors are identifiable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of parsing definitions for MuJoCo headers with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears safe and intended solely for static analysis or code generation tasks.",
