  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely defining static parsing rules for MuJoCo headers. It notes no runtime data handling, external commands, or malicious logic.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; risk score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Potential issues:** None. The report is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes that the code constructs parser objects without external data processing or malicious intent.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0, security risk of 0, aligns with the static nature.  \n- **Potential issues:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis confirms the code is a static parser setup with no runtime or external data processing.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk 0.  \n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the code is static parser definitions with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.  \n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly more conservative, assigns a security risk of 0.1, citing no malicious behavior but a minimal potential concern.  \n- **Score Justification:** Since the code is purely static parsing logic, a security risk of 0.1 seems unwarranted. No external data handling or dynamic code execution exists.  \n- **Potential issues:** The minor security risk score appears overestimated given the static nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static parser definitions.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** All are appropriately zero; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** For the first four reports, zero is justified. The fifth report's risk score of 0.1 seems slightly inflated given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk in static parser definitions)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- No evidence suggests any code execution, external communication, or handling of untrusted input at runtime.\n- The code is a static, domain-specific parser setup, which is inherently safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe scores across all reports are consistent with the code's static, benign purpose. The only minor adjustment is that the fifth report's security risk score should be **0** instead of 0.1, as no vulnerabilities or security concerns are present.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
