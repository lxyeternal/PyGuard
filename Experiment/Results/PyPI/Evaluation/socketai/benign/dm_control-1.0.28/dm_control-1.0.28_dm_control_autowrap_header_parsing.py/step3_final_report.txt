  "purpose": "Static pyparsing definitions for parsing MuJoCo header files, establishing grammar rules and helper functions without runtime data processing.",
  "sources": "Definitions of parsing patterns, helper functions for nested scopes and conditionals, keyword and token declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks, external commands, or network communication.",
  "flows": "Static pattern definitions and helper functions; no data flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is purely static, domain-specific parser setup with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static pyparsing grammar definitions for MuJoCo headers, including nested scopes, conditionals, and declarations. It does not handle untrusted data, execute commands, or perform any runtime actions. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-structured, domain-specific, and intended solely for parsing header files. All signals indicate benign, static behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static parser utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting the static, non-executable, domain-specific purpose.",
