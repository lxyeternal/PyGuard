{
  "purpose": "Defines parsing rules and helper functions for processing MuJoCo header files using pyparsing.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pyparsing' library; reads input data from external header files and code comments; reads preprocessor directives, macros, struct and enum definitions, function signatures, and variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct data outputs, network communication, or data leakage points present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input header text is parsed through defined grammar rules; no flow from untrusted input to dangerous operations is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected. The code solely defines parsing grammar and helper functions for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a set of pyparsing grammar components for parsing C/C++ header files related to MuJoCo. It includes functions for nested scopes and conditional structures, as well as specific patterns for macros, type declarations, enums, structs, and functions. The code appears to be a static parser generator with no runtime code execution, data handling, or external communication. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are present. It is a well-structured, domain-specific parser definition.",
  "conclusion": "The script serves as a static parsing tool for header files and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, utility-focused module with no evident threats.",
