  "purpose": "Setup and configuration of physics-based brick stacking and manipulation tasks for reinforcement learning environments, including object placement, reward calculations, and episode initialization.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters, random states, environment objects, physics states, and environment setup functions.",
  "sinks": "Object pose setting functions, environment modifications, reward computations, and visualization routines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameters and random states into environment setup, object placement, and reward functions; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for physics simulation environments involving brick stacking. It manipulates environment objects, initializes episodes with randomized or fixed configurations, and computes spatial rewards based on object positions. It uses well-known libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The logic is consistent, and the structure is clear, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured environment setup for reinforcement learning tasks involving bricks. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The environment is safe for use.",
