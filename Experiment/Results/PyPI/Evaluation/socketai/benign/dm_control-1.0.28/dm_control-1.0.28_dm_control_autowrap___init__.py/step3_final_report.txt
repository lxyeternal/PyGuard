  "purpose": "The code contains only licensing comments with no executable code or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Comments at the beginning of the file, licensing and copyright notices.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no untrusted data processing, no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static comments without data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; comments are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, with no executable code, data processing, or input/output operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The comments are standard licensing notices, and the scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign licensing comments with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
