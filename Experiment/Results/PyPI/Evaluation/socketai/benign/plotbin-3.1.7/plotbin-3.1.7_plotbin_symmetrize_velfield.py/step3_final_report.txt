  "purpose": "This code performs geometric transformations (rotation, reflection) and data interpolation to generate symmetric or point-symmetric galaxy velocity fields, primarily for astrophysical data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input coordinate arrays (xbin, ybin) and velocity measurements (vel_bin).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; the code operates in-memory without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data (xbin, ybin, vel_bin) are transformed via rotation and reflection, then interpolated using scipy.interpolate.griddata to produce symmetric velocity fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is clear, well-documented, and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric operations and interpolation for astrophysical data processing. It includes input validation, coordinate rotation, reflection for symmetry, and interpolation to generate symmetric velocity fields. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of scipy.interpolate.griddata is typical in scientific computing and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The operations are domain-specific and align with common practices in astrophysics data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for symmetry operations on galaxy kinematic data. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the use of interpolation functions, which is standard in this context. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (~0.1).",
