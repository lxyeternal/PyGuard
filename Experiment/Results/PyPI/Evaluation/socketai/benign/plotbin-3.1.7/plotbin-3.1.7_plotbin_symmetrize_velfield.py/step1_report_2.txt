  "purpose": "This code provides a function to generate symmetric or point-symmetric versions of galaxy velocity fields based on given kinematic measurements, for astrophysical analysis.",
  "sources": "The input data: xbin, ybin, vel_bin arrays (coordinates and velocities), and the parameters sym and pa.",
  "sinks": "The code performs data processing and interpolation, but does not include any explicit sinks that send data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays (xbin, ybin, vel_bin) into coordinate transformations and interpolation functions, then results are combined into symmetrized velocity arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of interpolation could be a vector if exploited, but in this context, it is standard scientific processing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements coordinate rotation and symmetric data generation using standard numpy and scipy functions. It includes assertions to validate input array sizes and types. The main function symmetrizes velocity fields by rotating points and interpolating data accordingly. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The code is consistent with typical scientific data processing routines, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate scientific utility for symmetrizing galaxy velocity fields. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. Its operations are limited to data transformation and interpolation, with no signs of malware or harmful behavior.",
