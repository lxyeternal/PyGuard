{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate symmetric or point-symmetric versions of galaxy kinematic measurements, likely for astrophysical data analysis.",
  "sources": "Inputs are xbin, ybin (coordinate bins), and vel_bin (velocity measurements). These are read from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code performs interpolation with scipy.interpolate.griddata, which could potentially be a sink if untrusted data is used; however, the data appears to be internal, derived from input parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (xbin, ybin, vel_bin) through coordinate transformations and interpolation steps, culminating in a symmetric velocity output (vel_sym).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly performs geometric transformations and data interpolation. No unusual behavior, obfuscation, or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs coordinate rotation and symmetry operations on galaxy kinematic data. It uses standard numpy operations and scipy.interpolate.griddata to generate symmetric velocity fields. The functions and code structure are straightforward, well-documented, and lack any malicious or suspicious code features. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific data processing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, domain-specific utility for galaxy kinematic symmetry operations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
