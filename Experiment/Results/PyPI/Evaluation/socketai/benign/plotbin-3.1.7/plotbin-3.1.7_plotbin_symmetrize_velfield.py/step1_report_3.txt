  "purpose": "This code generates symmetric or point-symmetric versions of galaxy kinematic measurements, used in astronomical data analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input coordinate arrays (xbin, ybin) and velocity measurements (vel_bin).",
  "sinks": "The code performs data interpolation and transformation but does not write data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate data are rotated and reflected to generate symmetric datasets, then interpolated; the output is a velocity array representing symmetry.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The interpolation and geometric transformations are standard for this domain.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary scientific libraries and defines functions to rotate points and generate symmetric velocity fields. It performs input validation, rotates coordinate data based on position angle, reflects data points for symmetry, and uses scipy.interpolate.griddata for data interpolation. The implementation follows standard mathematical procedures for symmetry operations on 2D data. No embedded or hidden malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code is well-documented, domain-specific, and appears solely for data processing in astrophysics.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate mathematical transformations for galaxy kinematic data without any malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, security risks, or suspicious behavior. The implementation is straightforward and domain-appropriate.",
