  "purpose": "This code provides a function to generate symmetric or point-symmetric versions of galaxy kinematic measurements for analysis in astrophysics.",
  "sources": "Input arrays xbin, ybin, and vel_bin, which are the spatial coordinates and velocity measurements of galaxy data points.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the interpolate.griddata function, which interpolates data based on input coordinates; no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "Coordinates (xbin, ybin) are rotated and mirrored depending on symmetry type, then passed to griddata to interpolate velocities at new positions, ultimately averaging to produce symmetric velocity profiles.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. Use of interpolation is appropriate for this context. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function to rotate points and a main function to generate symmetric velocity fields by reflecting and rotating input data points based on the specified symmetry parameter. It uses numpy for array operations and scipy.interpolate.griddata for data interpolation, handling both bi-symmetric and point-symmetric cases. The function validates input sizes and types, performs geometric transformations, interpolates velocities at symmetric positions, and averages results to produce a symmetric velocity profile. No external data sources, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code's operations are consistent with astrophysical data processing and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-documented, domain-specific utility for symmetry operations on galaxy kinematic data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard geometric transformations and data interpolation without suspicious side effects.",
