  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific utility for symmetry operations on galaxy kinematic data. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the use of interpolation functions, which is standard in this context. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (~0.1)."
