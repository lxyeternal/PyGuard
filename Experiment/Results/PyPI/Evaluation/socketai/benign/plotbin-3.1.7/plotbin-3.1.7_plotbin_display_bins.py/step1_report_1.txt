{
  "purpose": "The function displays a Voronoi binned map using input spatial coordinates, bin assignments, and associated velocity data. It primarily prepares data for visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters: x, y coordinates; bin_num array; and vel_bin array. It also imports the display_pixels function.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the call to display_pixels, which renders the visualization; data flows from input parameters to this visualization.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, bin_num, vel_bin) flows into assertions and then into display_pixels via vel_bin[bin_num], then output image is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard input validation and data passing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks that bin_num is an integer array and matches input sizes for x, y, and vel_bin. It then creates an image using display_pixels, passing velocity data indexed by bin numbers. The code relies on external display_pixels function. All operations are straightforward, primarily for visualization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected. The purpose aligns with data visualization, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign visualization utility for displaying binned spatial data. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this module.",
