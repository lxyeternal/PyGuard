{
  "purpose": "The function displays a Voronoi binned map using input spatial coordinates, bin identifiers, and associated velocity bins, passing parameters to an external display function.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: x, y, bin_num, vel_bin; external function call to display_pixels.",
  "sinks": "The call to display_pixels with processed data; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, bin_num, vel_bin) -> Validation checks -> Mapping vel_bin to bin_num indices -> display_pixels called with x, y, and mapped velocities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert statements for input validation; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious imports or obfuscated code; no network activity or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily validates input types and sizes, then maps bin indices to velocity values and calls an external display function. All operations appear straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import of display_pixels is from an external package, which is standard. No anomalous code patterns or obfuscated segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a visualization utility for binned spatial data, performing input validation and data processing without any malicious intent or security risks. It relies on an external display function to visualize data. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
