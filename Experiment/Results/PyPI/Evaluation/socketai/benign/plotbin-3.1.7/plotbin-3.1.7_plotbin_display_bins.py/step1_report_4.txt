{
  "purpose": "The code visualizes Voronoi-binned maps by plotting data points with associated velocities, utilizing external plotting functions.",
  "sources": "The input parameters x, y, bin_num, vel_bin, and any additional keyword arguments (**kwargs). The code reads data to generate a visual output.",
  "sinks": "The display_pixels function is called with processed data, which produces a plot or image. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data from x, y, bin_num, and vel_bin flows into the display_pixels function after processing vel_bin[bin_num], resulting in a visual output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. Input validation is performed, and external display function is used as intended.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with input validation, ensuring that bin_num is of integer type and that input vectors are of equal size. It verifies that vel_bin corresponds to the number of unique bin numbers. The main operation involves passing x, y, and the velocity data mapped via bin_num to the display_pixels function, which generates a visual representation. No suspicious or malicious operations are observed, and the code's purpose appears to be straightforward data visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization routine for plotting binned data with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly validates inputs and relies on external plotting functions without executing any harmful operations.",
