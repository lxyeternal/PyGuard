{
  "purpose": "The function visualizes Voronoi binning results by displaying a pixel map with associated velocities for each bin.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: x, y (coordinates), bin_num (bin indices), vel_bin (velocity data). The display_pixels() function is imported and called with these data.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the display_pixels() function, which generates and returns an image based on input data.",
  "flows": "x, y, and bin_num are used to index into vel_bin via bin_num to create an image; data flows from inputs through assertions to display_pixels(), producing an image.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior observed. The code contains standard assertions, imports, and function calls. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing numpy and display_pixels, then defines display_bins() which performs data validation (assertions) on input types and sizes. It asserts bin_num is an integer array, and that input vectors are of equal length. It also verifies that the size of vel_bin matches the number of unique bins. It then calls display_pixels() passing x, y, and the velocity data indexed by bin_num, along with any additional keyword arguments. The output of display_pixels() is returned as an image. No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected data processing and visualization patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility for binned spatial data. It includes input validation and a clear purpose. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
