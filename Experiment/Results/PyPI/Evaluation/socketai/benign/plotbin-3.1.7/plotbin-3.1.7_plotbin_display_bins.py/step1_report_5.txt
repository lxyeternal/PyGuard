{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to display a Voronoi binned map based on input coordinates, bin assignments, and associated velocity bins.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments: x, y, bin_num, and vel_bin.",
  "sinks": "The function calls display_pixels with untrusted data (x, y, vel_bin[bin_num]), which could potentially leak data if display_pixels is malicious or insecure.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments (x, y, bin_num, vel_bin) through assertions and into display_pixels, with vel_bin[bin_num] being a key transformation, then the output of display_pixels is returned.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscated code or unusual language features. Assertions are used to validate data types and sizes, but these are standard checks.",
  "analysis": "The function verifies input data types and sizes, then passes data to display_pixels, which likely handles visualization. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. The code appears straightforward, with no network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only external dependency is display_pixels, which itself is not suspicious but should be checked separately for malicious behavior. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate visualization function without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data visualization helper that processes input data and calls a display function. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
