  "purpose": "This function visualizes Voronoi-binned spatial data by validating inputs and passing velocity bin data to an external display function for rendering.",
  "sources": "Reads input coordinates (x, y), bin indices (bin_num), and velocity data (vel_bin); data flows from these inputs into the display_pixels function.",
  "sinks": "The external display_pixels function, which renders the visualization; potential for untrusted code execution if display_pixels is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data (x, y, vel_bin[bin_num]) flows directly into display_pixels, which generates the image output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation to ensure data integrity, checks that bin_num is of integer type, and that input vectors are of matching size. It then maps bin indices to velocity data and calls an external visualization function. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious external dependencies are present within this snippet. The reliance on display_pixels is standard for visualization routines but warrants trust in that external function. Overall, the code is benign, purpose-specific, and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only external dependency, display_pixels, should be reviewed separately for safety, but within this context, the code itself is benign.",
