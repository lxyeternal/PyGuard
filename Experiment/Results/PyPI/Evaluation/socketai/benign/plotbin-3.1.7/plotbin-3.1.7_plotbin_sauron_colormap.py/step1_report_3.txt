{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to define and register a custom colormap ('sauron') and its reverse ('sauron_r') for use in Matplotlib visualizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from numpy arrays for defining color control points, and it queries the current list of registered colormaps via plt.colormaps().",
  "sinks": "The code registers new colormaps using colormaps.register() and displays images with these colormaps via plt.imshow() for demonstration.",
  "flows": "The code checks existing colormaps, defines color mappings, registers new colormaps, and then uses these colormaps to generate images.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network connections, or malicious code. The code only manipulates visual colormaps and displays images; no sensitive data handling or external communication is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily registers a custom colormap in Matplotlib by defining color control points and their reversed counterpart. It checks for existing colormaps before registering to prevent duplication. The sample usage generates images to demonstrate the colormaps. The code does not include any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All functions utilize standard libraries and perform typical visualization setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for registering and demonstrating a custom colormap in Matplotlib. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It performs standard data visualization setup without suspicious or harmful actions.",
