{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers a custom colormap named 'sauron' and its reversed version 'sauron_r' for use with Matplotlib, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the colormap definitions (x, r, g, b arrays) and checks for existing colormap names in plt.colormaps(). It also loads data for visualization (numpy arrays x, y, img).",
  "sinks": "The code registers new colormaps in Matplotlib's colormap registry and creates visualizations using imshow(), which display the colormaps applied to data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking for existing colormap, defining colormap data, registering new colormaps, then visualizing an array with the new colormaps.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external connections. The code only deals with colormap registration and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard metadata and version notes, then imports necessary libraries. It defines a function to register custom colormaps only if they are not already registered, avoiding duplication. The colormap data is straightforward, and the registration process uses standard Matplotlib functions. The visualization at the end demonstrates the colormaps but does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. All operations are related to visualizations and colormap registration, which are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script solely adds and visualizes custom colormaps for Matplotlib. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign utility script for visualization purposes.",
