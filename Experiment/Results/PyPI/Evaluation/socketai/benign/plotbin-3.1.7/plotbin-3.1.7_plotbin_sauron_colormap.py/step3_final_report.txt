  "purpose": "Defines and registers a custom 'sauron' colormap and its reversed version in Matplotlib, then demonstrates their usage via plotting images.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded color control points arrays, matplotlib's colormap registration functions, and plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib's global colormap registry and visualization outputs; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Color control points are defined -> check for existing colormap -> register new colormap -> visualize with imshow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, external inputs, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard libraries and functions for visualization. It includes a check to prevent duplicate registration, and the data is hardcoded. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present. The registration modifies global state but is typical for such scripts. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for creating and visualizing a custom colormap in Matplotlib. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate; a minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflects the potential for global state modification but is justified given the benign context.",
