{
  "purpose": "The code defines and registers a custom colormap ('sauron' and its reversed version) in Matplotlib and demonstrates their usage by plotting example images.",
  "sources": "Reads data from numpy arrays and matplotlib's colormap registry; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib functions for colormap registration and image display; no sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Defines colormap data -> Registers colormap in matplotlib -> Uses colormap in plotting functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code merely creates and registers a custom colormap with straightforward plotting; no obfuscation, malicious data handling, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard implementation for creating and registering a custom colormap in matplotlib. It includes a check to avoid re-registering an existing colormap. The color data is hardcoded but does not pose security concerns. The usage example at the bottom plots example images with the custom colormap. No external input, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation for defining and registering a custom colormap in matplotlib, with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies. It is safe to use and review.",
